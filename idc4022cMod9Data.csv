1,17283,House Republicans Fret About Winning Their Health Care Suit - The New York Times,New York Times,Carl Hulse,12/31/2016,2016,12,,WASHINGTON  ?   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit which challenges the administration?s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist Donald J. Trump?s administration worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit which after the election has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. ?Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress it would be inappropriate to comment? said Phillip J. Blando a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. ?Upon taking office the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ? In a potentially   decision in 2015 Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies in violation of the Constitution without approval from Congress. The Justice Department confident that Judge Collyer?s decision would be reversed quickly appealed and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won House Republicans last month told the court that they ?and the  ?s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter to take effect after the  ?s inauguration on Jan. 20 2017. ? The suspension of the case House lawyers said will ?provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ? Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of ?cascading effects? if the   payments which have totaled an estimated $13 billion are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to mount a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ?s dim view of the health care law a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case ?will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions as well as for the nation?s health insurance and health care systems generally. ? No matter what happens House Republicans say they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies as required by the Constitution. In the suit which was initially championed by John A. Boehner the House speaker at the time and later in House committee reports Republicans asserted that the administration desperate for the funding had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010 and that no annual appropriation was required  ?   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  ?   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  ?   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House.
2,17284,Rift Between Officers and Residents as Killings Persist in South Bronx - The New York Times,New York Times,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,6/19/2017,2017,6,,After the bullet shells get counted the blood dries and the votive candles burn out people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the city?s efforts to fight it remain splintered underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct at the southern tip of the Bronx as in other poor minority neighborhoods across the country people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city?s 77 precincts the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city?s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough?s robbery squad is smaller than Manhattan?s even though the Bronx has had 1 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments outside methadone clinics and art studios people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors more fearful of a gunman?s crew than confident in the Police Department?s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller?s arrest or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras lights locks investigating police officers. ?Here we have nothing? she said. When it comes to ?  families? she said the authorities ?don?t really care as much. That?s how I feel. ? The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides  ?   14 in the precinct this year up from nine in 2015  ?   strain detectives and when they go unsolved as half of them have this year some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends witnesses and police officers the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes mental illness drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers? view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives? phones rarely ring with tips and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime a victim?s friends conduct their own investigations and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother?s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews? threats and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary?s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez 40 asked the young men to move they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime an anachronism in much of New York still rattles the 40th Precinct even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life he got a tech maintenance job and three years ago moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again he walked into a local substation Police Service Area 7 and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. ?There?s a lot of killers here and we are going to kill you? a sergeant?s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him ?I?m going to shoot through your window. ? Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers? names which appear in the reports and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later the same    propped his bike on their door ?then said if I was to open the door and say something they would body slam me? Mr. Fernandez?s wife Maria Fernandez wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to ?slap? her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because ?they are the ones snitching? her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation 10 days after the first brought no relief. A week later feeling desperate Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later she said when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s still very much present to some of the precinct?s residents. Around 6:30 each morning Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  ?   dead bodies with no known cause strip club brawls shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  ?   bring resistance at every turn reminding him of an earlier era in the city?s   campaign. ?I haven?t got one single phone call that?s putting me in the right direction here? said Sergeant LoPuzzo the head of the precinct?s detective squad one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim?s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. ?And people just don?t understand that. ? Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September more than a third  ?   66 victims  ?   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy in 2012 the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18 276 stops that year 15 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. ?I need to bring something in today to justify my existence? Officer Argenis Rosado who joined the precinct in 2010 said in an interview at the station house. ?So now you?re in a small area and day after day you?re hammering the same community. Of course that community?s eventually going to turn on you. ? The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. ?Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently too? said Hector Espada a   veteran of the precinct. ?Not because they wanted to but because they had to. Because some way or somehow you can?t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. ? Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years one of them after officers were found to be ?ticket fixing? or forgiving parking tickets for friends and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units like   that put them in   situations on the street. ?Whenever I walked through the doors of the precinct to me it seemed like a black cloud? said Russell Lewis a    of the 40th. ?It was like a heaviness. When you walked in all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home because you didn?t want to get caught up in anything. ? The precinct covers only about two square miles but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  ?   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner James P. O?Neill said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January part of a citywide effort under Mr. O?Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call who can listen to people?s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. ?That perception really sticks? he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precinct?s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year and many others have loads in the high 300s even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    ?   murders rapes felony assaults and robberies. By contrast a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32 the citywide median. Last year the 40th was the    for violent crime with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year compared with 27 in Manhattan 37 in Brooklyn 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx often have more property felonies like stolen laptops or credit cards and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino the head of the Detectives? Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer said staffing disparities affected the department?s efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation he said: ?If I cooperate with the detectives there?s so much work there?s so few of them there they won?t even get the chance to protect me or they?ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. ? Sergeant LoPuzzo who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had and that while every squad wanted more detectives staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. ?We fight with the army we have not the army we wish we had? he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Times?s analysis of confidential staffing data the department?s chief of detectives Robert K. Boyce vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies gangs or grand larcenies for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001 even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct?s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park where crime dropped by a third over that period grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city?s last ?? the busiest precincts. Rather they say the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. ?Any crime in Manhattan has to be solved? said Howard Landesberg who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. ?The outer boroughs are like forgotten. ? Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx Brooklyn and Queens where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last year?s homicides detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan 63 percent in the Bronx 62 percent in Queens 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. ?It?s the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan? said Joseph L. Giacalone a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad in part ?because that?s where the money is. ? He added: ?When de Blasio came in he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he?s done the complete opposite of what he said. It?s just business as usual. ? The Bronx?s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyn?s rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated said Patrice O?Shaughnessy a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney?s office. The district attorney Darcel D. Clark elected in 2015 said in a statement ?I was a judge here in the Bronx and I heard from jurors that they can?t be impartial because they don?t trust the police. ? Against that tide of mistrust Sergeant LoPuzzo?s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son?s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precinct?s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist?s help. Victims? families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective Jeff Meenagh said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would ?get what you deserve. ? The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman?s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  ?   about a gun under a car for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez in the Betances Houses said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  ?   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door so they could get in whenever they wanted showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor?s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building causing the young men to scatter but did not come inside Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez?s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victim?s advocate in the district attorney?s office. On Oct. 20 2015 he sent an online note to the police commissioner?s office. ?We went to all proper channels for help? the note said. ?Both precincts failed us except 2 officers who helped us but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. ? ?40th and PSA 7 won?t do anything? he wrote referring to the local substation. ?Please we need to speak to some one with authority. ? The local substation commander Deputy Inspector Jerry O?Sullivan and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman?s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. ?I have no faith in the City of New York I have no faith in the police I have no faith in the politicians? Mr. Fernandez said. ?The only thing I know for sure: God if we?re in a situation again I will be left to defend my family. ? Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. ?I?m bending over backward and nobody?s not even doing anything? he said. ?Why am I going to help you if you ain?t going to help me?? By last January a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command Inspector O?Sullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. ?No one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment? he said. Mr. Fernandez?s complaints did not spur any arrests but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May he had moved his family away.
3,17285,Tyrus Wong ?Bambi? Artist Thwarted by Racial Bias Dies at 106 - The New York Times,New York Times,Margalit Fox,1/6/2017,2017,1,,When Walt Disney?s ?Bambi? opened in 1942 critics praised its spare haunting visual style vastly different from anything Disney had done before. But what they did not know was that the film?s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to ?Bambi? which remains a   mark for film animation would not be widely known for decades. Like the film?s title character the artist Tyrus Wong weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  ?   and in the hope of making a life in America incarceration isolation and rigorous interrogation  ?   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed he endured poverty discrimination and chronic lack of recognition not only for his work at Disney but also for his fine art before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. Wong died on Friday at 106. A Hollywood studio artist painter printmaker calligrapher   illustrator and in later years maker of fantastical kites he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition when Mr. Wong did find it was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter Mr. Wong was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in California between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934 his work was included in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago that also featured Picasso Matisse and Paul Klee. As a staff artist for Hollywood studios from the 1930s to the 1960s he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings as detailed as any architectural illustrations that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for Disney and   films for Warner Brothers and other studios among them ?The Sands of Iwo Jima? (1949) ?Rebel Without a Cause? (1955) and ?The Wild Bunch? (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked it was for ?Bambi? that Mr. Wong was  ?   belatedly  ?   most renowned. ?He was truly involved with every phase of production? John Canemaker an   animator and a historian of animation at New York University said in an interview for this obituary in March. ?He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ? In 2013 and 2014 Mr. Wong was the subject of ?Water to Paper Paint to Sky? a major retrospective at the Disney Family Museum in San Francisco. From the museum?s windows which overlook San Francisco Bay he could contemplate Angel Island where more than nine decades earlier as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. Wong Gen Yeo (the name is sometimes Romanized Wong Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25 1910 in a farming village in Guangdong Province. As a young child he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920 seeking better economic prospects Gen Yeo and his father embarked for the United States leaving his mother and sister behind. Gen Yeo would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  ?   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a ?paper son?  ?   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur the act which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country was among the earliest United States laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906 an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents including birth and immigration records were destroyed many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss maintaining that they had been born in San Francisco before the fire. As United States citizens they were entitled to bring over their relatives  ?   or in the case of Gen Yeo and his father ?paper sons? posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception United States immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately and the answers had to match. For the new arrival a major mistake or a series of smaller ones could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    Gen Yeo would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30 1920 after a month at sea the Wongs landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. Wong was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as Look Tai Yow. ?Angel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast? Lisa See the author of ?On Gold Mountain? (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family said in an interview in 2016. However she continued: ?The goal was really very different than Ellis Island which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ? Because Mr. Wong?s father had previously lived in the United States as Look Get he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival Gen Yeo was detained on the island for nearly a month the only child among the immigrants being held there. ?I was scared half to death I just cried? Mr. Wong recalled in ?Tyrus? an   documentary directed by Pamela Tom which premiered in 2015. ?Every day is just miserable  ?   miserable. I hated that place. ? On Jan. 27 1921 in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer young Gen Yeo posing as Look Tai Yow was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. Gen Yeo was well prepared and answered without error. In Sacramento where he joined his father a schoolteacher Americanized ?Tai Yow? to ?Tyrus? and he was known as Tyrus Wong ever after. Soon afterward father and son were separated once more when the elder Mr. Wong moved to Los Angeles to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a Sacramento boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  ?   possibly more  ?   Tyrus traveled to Los Angeles to join his father who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two Pasadena families earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high a teacher noting his drawing talent arranged a summer scholarship to the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. By his own account an indifferent student in public school Tyrus found his calling at the institute now the Otis College of Art and Design. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  ?   a small fortune  ?   to let him stay on as Otis?s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years simultaneously working as the school janitor before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died leaving young Mr. Wong entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938 Mr. Wong was an artist for the Works Progress Administration creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends including the   artist Benji Okubo he founded the Oriental Artists? Group of Los Angeles which organized exhibitions of members? work  ?   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. Wong newly married and needing steady work joined Disney in 1938 as an ?? creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at Hollywood studios and Mr. Wong was made keenly aware of the fact first at Disney and later at Warner Brothers. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ?s job itself: Painstaking repetitive and for Mr. Wong quickly   it is the   work of animation  ?   ?a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter? Mr. Canemaker said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s when Mr. Wong learned that Disney was adapting ?Bambi a Life in the Woods? the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer Felix Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book Disney had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film ?Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  ?   every petal on every flower every leaf on every tree  ?   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for ?Bambi? it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. Wong spied his chance. ?I said ?Gee this is all outdoor scenery?? he recalled in a video interview years afterward adding: ?I said ?Gee I?m a landscape painter! ?? Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (A. D. 960 ?  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody lyrical and atmospheric  ?   at once lush and spare  ?   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. ?Walt Disney went crazy over them? said Mr. Canemaker who wrote about Mr. Wong in his book ?Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists? (1996). ?He said ?I love this indefinite quality the mysterious quality of the forest. ?? Mr. Wong was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. ?But he was more than that? Mr. Canemaker explained. ?He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings he inspired people. ? Mr. Wong spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of ?Bambi. ? Throughout the finished film  ?   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  ?   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941 in the wake of a bitter employees? strike that year Disney fired Mr. Wong. Though he had chosen not to strike  ?   he felt the studio had been good to him Mr. Canemaker said  ?   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On ?Bambi? Mr. Wong?s name appears quite far down in the credits as a mere ?background? artist. Mr. Wong joined Warner Brothers in 1942 working there  ?   and lent out on occasion to other studios  ?   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house he and his wife the former Ruth Kim were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. ?Then in a month you?d go back there and the sign was still there? Mr. Wong recalled in ?Tyrus. ? After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 Mr. Wong like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage lest an angry American beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling Oriental Artists? Group. Mr. Wong?s friend Mr. Okubo was sent with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. ?If World War II hadn?t happened when it did I think these artists even the   artists would have more of a name than they do today? Ms. See said. ?And that?s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ? Mr. Wong who became a United States citizen in 1946 also designed Christmas cards for Hallmark and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of Sunland Calif. he became in retirement a renowned kitemaker designing building and hand coloring astonishing airworthy creations  ?   butterflies swallows whole flocks of owls centipedes more than 100 feet long  ?   that streaked the Southern California sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth Wong?s life when she was ill with dementia Mr. Wong forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995 he slowly began making art again. In 2001 in formal recognition of his influence on ?Bambi? Mr. Wong was named a Disney Legend. The honor  ?   whose previous recipients include Fred MacMurray Julie Andrews and Annette Funicello  ?   is bestowed by the Walt Disney Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003 a retrospective of his work curated in part by Ms. See was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles. The Disney Family Museum?s retrospective ?Water to Paper Paint to Sky? traveled in 2015 to the Museum of Chinese in America in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Wong?s death at his home in Sunland was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. Tom. His survivors include three daughters Kay Fong   Wong and Kim Wong and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small Mr. Wong encouraged them to make art as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained he said by lines laid down by others.
4,17286,Among Deaths in 2016 a Heavy Toll in Pop Music - The New York Times,New York Times,William McDonald,4/10/2017,2017,4,,Death may be the great equalizer but it isn?t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  ?   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  ?   the pop music world had hands down the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie whose stage persona  ?   androgynous glam rocker dance pop star electronic experimentalist  ?   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album released just two days before his death but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock about three months later when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57 and by all indications no one including Prince Rogers Nelson had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever holding to an otherwise healthy regimen he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade so why not death too? Leonard Cohen on the other hand in his 83rd year undoubtedly did see it coming just over his shoulder but he went on his  ?   I hesitate to say merry  ?   way ever the wise   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially ?Until then here?s another song. ? It was as if 2016 hadn?t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can?t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth Wind  Fire. Leon Russell the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man?s mass of hair died. So did Merle Haggard rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis?s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John Paul George and Ringo (and by extension on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century the boxer who combined power grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him even loved him for his principled stands his high spirits his lightning mind his winking   and yes his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in little could contain him certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer too was transformational golf?s first media star. The gentleman?s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge his shirt coming untucked a cigarette dangling from his lips his club just that a weapon as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie and not a few women did too. He was athletically blessed magnetically cool telegenically handsome  ?   but he was somehow one of them too. The same was said of Gordie Howe Mr. Hockey a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca a trolley car conductor?s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  ?   his the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  ?   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt the coach who elevated women?s basketball led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach could not defeat Alzheimer?s disease dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette an Olympic college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond a defensive stalwart who battled Russell Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career was 74. Even older in the baseball ranks was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96 there were few people still around who could remember watching him play particularly in his prime in the 1940s when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball?s first black executive but when he died fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question in an entirely different sphere arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and more urgently a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan?s death evoked the 1980s White House where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn?s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan avatars of defiance harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War?s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly?s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing?s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno the first woman to serve as attorney general recalled the Clinton years all eight of them from the firestorm at Waco Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Elin Gonzlez to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores Fidel Castro?s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel in New York after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers too are   even in fiction then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee Umberto Eco Pat Conroy Jim Harrison Anita Brookner Alvin Toffler Gloria Naylor and William Trevor not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer Dario Fo and   Edward Albee  ?   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  ?   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher the     Princess Leia of the ?Star Wars? tales. Just a day later capping a year of startling deaths Ms. Reynolds a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era died at 84 in the throes of a mother?s grief. Devotees of the ?Harry Potter? movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career on both stage and screen was far richer than many of Snape?s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor?s celebrity by contrast outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda of the ?Godfather? movies and ?Barney Miller? actually did die after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette the French New Wave auteur with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami the Iranian master with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics? eyes with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (?Adventures of Superman?) Alan Young (?Mister Ed?) Robert Vaughn (?The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ?) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on ?The Patty Duke Show?) Dan Haggerty (?The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams?) Florence Henderson (?The Brady Bunch?) and Alan Thicke (?Growing Pains?). And Garry Marshall the creative force who practically owned prime time with ?Happy Days? ?Mork  Mindy? ?Laverne  Shirley? and more died at 81. On Broadway lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham who found fashion statements on every corner was suddenly missing making Manhattan overnight a less idiosyncratic less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker?s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  ?   what a picture!  ?   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber Marc Riboud Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music?s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive Grant Tinker who in the ?80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics and the smaller world of women in science said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but even more gratitude. Come to think of it eliciting a large if silent thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone?s guess. But we know for certain that some were and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were too all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy their very lives.
5,17287,Kim Jong-un Says North Korea Is Preparing to Test Long-Range Missile - The New York Times,New York Times,Choe Sang-Hun,1/2/2017,2017,1,,SEOUL South Korea  ?   North Korea?s leader Kim   said on Sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  ?   a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump. Although North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone and although it habitually threatens to attack the United States with nuclear weapons the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM. In his annual New Year?s Day speech which was broadcast on the North?s   KCTV on Sunday Mr. Kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said North Korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the United States remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with South Korea. ?We have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket? he said. Analysts in the region have said Mr. Kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months taking advantage of leadership changes in the United States and South Korea. Mr. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20. In South Korea President Park   whose powers were suspended in a Parliamentary impeachment on Dec. 9 is waiting for the Constitutional Court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated. If North Korea conducts a    test in coming months it will test Mr. Trump?s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions North Korea has been advancing toward Mr. Kim?s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. Mr. Kim?s speech on Sunday indicated that North Korea may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program said Cheong   a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. Trump?s inauguration Mr. Cheong said. ?We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year?s speech where Kim   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile? he said. In his speech Mr. Kim did not comment on Mr. Trump?s election. Doubt still runs deep that North Korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the North?s launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the North?s satellite launch in February South Korean defense officials said the Unha rocket used in the launch if successfully reconfigured as a missile could fly more than 7 400 miles with a warhead of 1 100 to 1 300 pounds  ?   far enough to reach most of the United States. North Korea has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific including those on Guam. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth?s atmosphere without breaking up. In April North Korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time Mr. Kim said the North ?can tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth including the U. S. mainland within our striking range. ? On Sept. 9 the North conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test. Mr. Kim later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November the United Nations Security Council imposed new  sanctions against the North.
6,17288,Sick With a Cold Queen Elizabeth Misses New Year?s Service - The New York Times,New York Times,Sewell Chan,1/2/2017,2017,1,,LONDON  ?   Queen Elizabeth II who has been battling a cold for more than a week missed a New Year?s Day church service at her country estate in Sandringham Buckingham Palace said on Sunday. A week earlier the queen who is 90 missed a Christmas Day church service for the first time since 1988 because of the illness. ?The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold? the palace said in a statement. The queen?s husband Prince Philip who had also been ill was well enough to attend both services in the church at Sandringham which is in Norfolk on the east coast of England. The queen who ascended to the throne in 1952 became the world?s   monarch following the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand in October. She is also Britain?s   monarch having last year surpassed Queen Victoria?s   reign. Her mother lived until the age of 101.
7,17289,Taiwan?s President Accuses China of Renewed Intimidation - The New York Times,New York Times,Javier C. Hernndez,1/2/2017,2017,1,,BEIJING  ?   President Tsai   of Taiwan sharply criticized China?s leaders on Saturday saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island. ?Step by step Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan? she told journalists in Taipei the capital at a   news conference. Tensions between Taiwan and China which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949 intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American   Donald J. Trump breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday Beijing announced that So Tom and Prncipe an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan?s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies had switched its allegiance to the mainland provoking an outcry in Taiwan. Despite Beijing?s recent actions which she said had ?hurt the feelings? of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation. ?We will not bow to pressure and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation? she said. Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides. But the election of Mr. Trump could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The   has also questioned the One China policy which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades and criticized China?s military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Bonnie S. Glaser an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said Ms. Tsai?s words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of China?s show of strength. ?She remains calm rational and patient? Ms. Glaser wrote in an email. Still Ms. Tsai whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. Trump will use the island as a bargaining chip against China. And Ms. Tsai?s preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. Trump?s bombastic style. Richard C. Bush the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington said Ms. Tsai understood the need to ?maintain a balance among relations with China relations with the United States and domestic politics. ? Ms. Tsai?s vision however ?may not align well with the incoming Trump administration?s apparent belief that it can pressure China on all fronts more than the Obama administration has? he said. Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan. Ms. Tsai described the visit as ?unofficial? saying ?A transit stop is just a transit stop. ?
8,17290,After ?The Biggest Loser? Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight - The New York Times,New York Times,Gina Kolata,2/8/2017,2017,2,,Danny Cahill stood slightly dazed in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of NBC?s reality television show ?The Biggest Loser? shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  ?   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening Dec. 8 2009 he weighed just 191 pounds down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts he was lean athletic and as handsome as a model. ?I?ve got my life back? he declared. ?I mean I feel like a million bucks. ? Mr. Cahill left the show?s stage in Hollywood and flew directly to New York to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows chatting with Jay Leno Regis Philbin and Joy Behar. As he heard from fans all over the world his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact most of that season?s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences while a bitter personal disappointment have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8?s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. Kevin Hall a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV had the idea to follow the ?Biggest Loser? contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results the researchers said were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. ?It is frightening and amazing? said Dr. Hall an expert on metabolism at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases which is part of the National Institutes of Health. ?I am just blown away. ? It has to do with resting metabolism which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began the contestants though hugely overweight had normal metabolisms for their size meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  ?   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  ?   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that ?The Biggest Loser? contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed the contestants? metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. Cahill was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds his metabolism slowed so much that just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation?s obesity problem which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that said Dr. Michael Schwartz an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington is ?new and important. ? ?The key point is that you can be on TV you can lose enormous amounts of weight you can go on for six years but you can?t get away from a basic biological reality? said Dr. Schwartz who was not involved in the study. ?As long as you are below your initial weight your body is going to try to get you back. ? The show?s doctor Robert Huizenga says he expected the contestants? metabolic rates to fall just after the show but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned though whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult he said which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. ?Unfortunately many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors psychologists sleep specialists and trainers  ?   and that?s something we all need to work hard to change? he said in an email. The study?s findings to be published on Monday in the journal Obesity are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a person?s body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  ?   it may be an effect of aging  ?   at any point there is a weight that is easy to maintain and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First though they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. David Ludwig the director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children?s Hospital who was not involved in the research said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But he added the findings made sense. ?This is a subset of the most successful? dieters he said. ?If they don?t show a return to normal in metabolism what hope is there for the rest of us?? Still he added ?that shouldn?t be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. ? Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved they say can progress truly be made against obesity. ?There is a lot of basic research we still need to do? said Dr. Margaret Jackson who is directing a project at Pfizer. Her group is testing a drug that in animals at least acts like leptin a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: Erinn Egbert a   caregiver for her mother in Versailles Ky. And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. ?What people don?t understand is that a treat is like a drug? said Ms. Egbert who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show and now weighs between 152 and 157. ?Two treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. ? Six years after Season 8 ended 14 of the 16 contestants went to the N. I. H. last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit and had the information sent remotely to the N. I. H. The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked but on further reflection decided the numbers explained a lot. ?All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight? Mr. Cahill said. ?The moment I started drinking beer there goes another 20 pounds. I said ?This is not right. Something is wrong with my body. ?? Sean Algaier 36 a pastor from Charlotte N. C. feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. ?It?s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence? he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight though. They constantly battled hunger cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the season?s finale they had almost no leptin at all which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned their leptin levels drifted up again but only to about half of what they had been when the season began the researchers found thus helping to explain their urges to eat. Leptin is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger and although Dr. Hall and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them another group of researchers in a different project did. In a   study funded by Australia?s National Health and Medical Research Council Dr. Joseph Proietto of the University of Melbourne and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds but over the next year the pounds started coming back. Dr. Proietto and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. ?What was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is? Dr. Proietto said. ?The body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. ? Mr. Cahill 46 said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat then fatter. He would starve himself and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him and his weight climbed: 370 pounds 400 460 485. ?I used to look at myself and think ?I am horrible I am a monster subhuman?? he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. ?I remember sitting in a dressing room one day and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought ?I should just run out in front of a car. ?? He eventually seized on ?The Biggest Loser? as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the ?Biggest Loser? ranch with the other contestants Mr. Cahill exercised seven hours a day burning 8 000 to 9 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. Cahill set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  ?   typically one egg and two egg whites half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower ride home eat lunch  ?   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the show?s finale Mr. Cahill and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained to their surprise and horror after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. Cahill knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever and for the next four years he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago he went back to his job as a surveyor and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. Cahill started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again to 275 then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips thinking he will have just a few. ?I?d eat five bites. Then I?d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say ?What did I do? ?? Dr. Lee Kaplan an obesity researcher at Harvard says the brain sets the number of calories we consume and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. Michael Rosenbaum an obesity researcher at Columbia University who has collaborated with Dr. Hall in previous studies said the body?s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still pounds can insidiously creep on. ?We eat about 900 000 to a million calories a year and burn them all except those annoying 3 000 to 5 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds? he said. ?These very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  ?   less than one Starburst candy  ?   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. ? ?It is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle the environment or just the biology of aging? Dr. Rosenbaum added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight Dr. Hall said. Yes there are signals to regain weight but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug canagliflozin that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost they were without realizing it eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories Dr. Hall said were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And he added if people fought the urge to eat those calories they would be hungry. ?Unless they continue to fight it constantly they will regain the weight? he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  ?     or   diets for example  ?   and to exercise and   drugs among other interventions. But Dr. Ludwig said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. ?There are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories? he said but he added that ?for most people the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  ?   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. ? Dr. Rosenbaum agreed. ?The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of the U. S. A. ? he said. Mr. Cahill knows that now. And with his report from Dr. Hall?s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. ?That shame that was on my shoulders went off? he said.
9,17291,First a Mixtape. Then a Romance. - The New York Times,New York Times,Katherine Rosman,12/31/2016,2016,12,,Just how   is Hillary Kerr the    founder of a   digital media company in Los Angeles? She can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband. It was ?These Days? the version sung by Nico the German   made famous by Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Actually the song had been playing just before she met Jonathan Leahy now 38 on that December night in 2011 at the 4100 Bar in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles. Ms. Kerr can?t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down ?like Tigger? as she put it. In answering the usual     questions Mr. Leahy told her he was a music supervisor for ?Girls? the HBO show created by and starring Lena Dunham. That was enough to get Ms. Kerr bouncing. ?Your music has changed my life!? she told Mr. Leahy. Mr. Leahy who is quiet but not shy (at least he doesn?t jump up and down upon meeting people) was mesmerized. ?My main reaction? he said ?was it?s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you?re working on a hit show. ? They exchanged email addresses more an act of politeness than promise. Then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year. Both Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr had active social lives but they were focused on their careers. Mr. Leahy who grew up in Laconia N. H. graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg Va. in 2000 and landed in Los Angeles later that year. Now he is a music supervisor with Aperture Music and is joined by Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe in being responsible for the music on ?Girls. ? The team has also worked on films including ?Trainwreck? and television series such as ?New Girl. ? In addition Mr. Leahy is the music supervisor for ?Survivor?s Remorse? on Starz. Ms. Kerr grew up in the La Jolla section of San Diego graduated from the University of Southern California in 2000 and eventually made her way to New York where she took a job as an assistant at Elle magazine. In 2005 she moved back to the West Coast to Los Angeles and with a fellow Elle alum  Katherine Power created a company best known for its website Who What Wear which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors. Ms. Kerr and Ms. Power also started the Who What Wear clothing and accessories line sold at Target. It was nine months after their initial meeting that Mr. Leahy emailed Ms. Kerr. He had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry. Ms. Kerr Mr. Leahy and his friend met for a long boozy brunch. They began to email and text a bit. ?There was banter? Ms. Kerr said but neither knew the interest or intention of the other. A few months later she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band Lord Huron. Mr. Leahy happens to be a friend of Ben Schneider the band?s lead singer and had an extra ticket. ?This was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are? Mr. Leahy said. He and Ms. Kerr met up at the show. That is when Mr. Leahy and Ms. Kerr moved into the ambiguous ?mixtape era? in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy ?are we just friends or what? texts revolving around music. For example Ms. Kerr was visiting New York and texted Mr. Leahy a request for ?walking around SoHo music. ? He sent her a link to ?Love Me Again? by John Newman. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. ?I wanted to read into it? Ms. Kerr said but she figured (correctly it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn?t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a Fleetwood Mac version of ?Need Your Love So Bad. ? After listening to it Ms. Kerr said ?I called my friend Katie. ? ?At that time? she continued ?I just referred to him as ?the supervisor.? She knew I had a crush on him. She said ?How can it not mean something? ?? Mr. Leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. Kerr a message with this song. ?I sort of thought ?Maybe it?s too much. ?? But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song ?BedBedBedBedBed Vacationer Remix? by Deleted Scenes ?during the friend phase? Ms. Kerr said.) Ms. Kerr played the game too. She made Mr. Leahy a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled ?Feynman Diagrams for All? after Mr. Leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of Feynman diagrams  ?   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  ?   was romantic. On the mix Ms. Kerr included the Mazzy Star song ?I?ve Been Let Down. ? It was ?a bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings? she said. Around this time Ms. Kerr texted Mr. Leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar  the Roger Room. She had focused on a drink named for the song ?Christmas Card From a Hooker in Minneapolis? which happens to be Mr. Leahy?s favorite Tom Waits tune. ?This made me rethink things a bit? he said adding ?Hillary Kerr was clearly not to be trifled with. ? In early 2014 Mr. Leahy invited her to a Bleachers concert. The band?s lead singer is Jack Antonoff who is Ms. Dunham?s boyfriend. Ms. Dunham was at the concert as well and on meeting Ms. Kerr she said ?I?ve heard so much about you. ? Ms. Kerr and Mr. Leahy shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on Polihale Beach in Kauai Hawaii on Jan. 1 2016. On Dec. 10 125 friends and relatives gathered in Palm Springs Calif. at the Colony Palms Hotel which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster Al Wertheimer and whose poolside guests have included Frank Sinatra Ronald Reagan Kirk Douglas and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Ms. Kerr walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played ?Once With Feeling? an instrumental song Mr. Leahy wrote for Ms. Kerr. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception a few of Ms. Kerr?s best friends descended upon her. Jen Atkin the celebrity hairstylist and social media star started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the bride?s hair. Joey Maalouf the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the Glam App whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the bride?s pucker. He had done her makeup. ?The look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect? he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). ?This looks like it?s art directed? Eva Chen the head of fashion partnerships for Instagram said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at Elle with Ms. Kerr. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match based on passion not only for each other but also for music. Leigh Belz Ray the features and news director at InStyle was another former Elle colleague who made the trip. ?Hillary loves music and it?s not just a casual thing? Ms. Ray said. ?We used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director and now she?s married to one. ? After a romantic first dance to Solomon Burke?s ?If You Need Me? Mr. and Mrs. Leahy (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their Hawaiian honeymoon Mr. Leahy completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10 2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel Palm Springs Calif. Flora The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis because white birch is the state tree of New Hampshire where Mr. Leahy grew up and where his parents Richard and Marie Leahy reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies Sahara roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. Leahy?s family is Roman Catholic Ms. Kerr?s parents John and Carole Kerr are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. Marshall Goldsmith an executive coach author and lifelong family friend of Ms. Kerr officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from James Kavanaugh and Mary Oliver as well as a passage from the Supreme Court?s 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. ?A little Catholic priest a little lesbian Pulitzer Prize winner a little equal rights for all? Ms. Kerr explained after the ceremony.
10,17292,Calling on Angels While Enduring the Trials of Job - The New York Times,New York Times,Andy Newman,12/31/2016,2016,12,,Angels are everywhere in the Muiz family?s apartment in the Bronx: paintings of angels on the wall ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As Jos and Zoraida Muiz and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks including cancer debilitating epilepsy deep depression and near eviction it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. Zoraida?s early life in Puerto Rico was like something from a tropical Dickens novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children?s father withdrew support. Then Zoraida?s grandfather  ?   the father of her absent father  ?   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met Jos a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle a judge they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to New York in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction using skills she learned as a child and in a clothing store. But in 1987 Mr. Muiz began having violent seizures  ?   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life they started a family. Their first child Jos Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That?s where the angels came in  ?   the first one was a painting a gift from a cousin.  ?When they operated on my son they told me he was an angel because he was supposed to die? Ms. Muiz 50 said. ?From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. ? All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives or picked up off the street just like all the furniture in the Muizes? overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the Bronx much of it restored by Ms. Muiz. ?So many people throw away things so I don?t have to buy? she said. A second son Jesus became epileptic at 3. A girl Maria completed the family. In 2007 Mr. Muiz had what felt like a horrible stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. Muiz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. ?I?m willing to take anything with him? she said. ?I never left him alone and I never will. ? Radiation did not work. To save Mr. Muiz?s life surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured depressed and unable to speak he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the Muiz children grew up. ?We?ve been through every craziness? said Jos Jr. 24 who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment ?every up and down. ? For years at a time the family held on seemingly by a thread. Over the summer the younger son Jesus 22 got a   job at a Zaro?s Bakery in Manhattan?s financial district. Because the family?s rent is tied to income the rent tripled in August to about $770 a month from $245. But Jesus had school bills to pay and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for Jos Sr. ?s mother who died over the summer and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. Muiz got in touch with Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times?s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from the Neediest Cases Fund the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. Jesus is returning to college where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. Maria graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness she wants to be an oncologist. Jos Jr. was just accepted to the New York Film Academy?s photography program. But Jos Sr. continues to battle cancer. Zoraida is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. ?They give me my strength even if I have times I collapse? she said. Jos Jr. agreed. ?I use my parents and siblings as my motivation? he said. ?We?re all there for each other? Ms. Muiz said.
11,17293,Weak Federal Powers Could Limit Trump?s Climate-Policy Rollback - The New York Times,New York Times,Justin Gillis,1/3/2017,2017,1,,With Donald J. Trump about to take control of the White House it would seem a dark time for the renewable energy industry. After all Mr. Trump has mocked the science of global warming as a Chinese hoax threatened to kill a global deal on climate change and promised to restore the coal industry to its former glory. So consider what happened in the middle of December after investors had had a month to absorb the implications of Mr. Trump?s victory. The federal government opened bidding on a tract of the ocean floor off New York State as a potential site for a huge wind farm. Up up and away soared the offers  ?   interest from the bidders was so fevered that the auction went through 33 rounds and spilled over to a second day. In the end the winning bidder offered the federal Treasury $42 million more than twice what the government got in August for oil leases  ?   oil leases  ?   in the Gulf of Mexico. Who won the bid? None other than Statoil the Norwegian oil company which is in the midst of a major campaign to turn itself into a big player in renewable energy. We do not know for sure that the New York wind farm will get built but we do know this: The energy transition is real and Mr. Trump is not going to stop it. On a global scale more than half the investment in new electricity generation is going into renewable energy. That is more than $300 billion a year a sign of how powerful the momentum has become. Wind power is booming in the United States with the industry adding manufacturing jobs in the reddest states. When Mr. Trump?s appointees examine the facts they will learn that   technician is projected to be the   occupation in America over the next decade. The election of Mr. Trump left climate activists and environmental groups in despair. They had pinned their hopes on a Hillary Clinton victory and a continuation of President Obama?s strong push to tackle global warming. Now of course everything is in flux. In the worst case with a sufficiently pliant Congress Mr. Trump could roll back a decade of progress on climate change. Barring some miraculous conversion on Mr. Trump?s part his election cannot be interpreted as anything but bad news for the climate agenda. Yet despair might be an overreaction. For starters when Mr. Trump gets to the White House he will find that the federal government actually has relatively little control over American energy policy and particularly over electricity generation. The coal industry has been ravaged in part by cheap natural gas which is abundant because of technological changes in the way it is produced and there is no lever in the Oval Office that Mr. Trump can pull to reverse that. The intrinsically weak federal role was a source of frustration for Mr. Obama and his aides but now it will work to the benefit of environmental advocates. They have already persuaded more than half the states to adopt mandates on renewable energy. Efforts to roll those back have largely failed with the latest development coming only last week when Gov. John Kasich of Ohio a Republican vetoed a rollback bill. The federal government does offer important subsidies for renewable energy and they will surely become a target in the new Congress. But those subsidies are already scheduled to fall drastically over five years in a deal cut a year ago that gave the oil industry some favors and that passed Congress with many Republican votes. If Mr. Trump pushes for an early end to the subsidies he will find that renewable energy has friends in the Republican Party. Topping that list is Charles E. Grassley the senior senator from Iowa. That state  ?     in presidential politics let us remember  ?   will soon be getting 40 percent of its electricity from wind power. ?Senator Grassley has been and continues to be an extraordinary leader and champion for the wind industry? said Tom Kiernan the head of the American Wind Energy Association a trade group. When I spoke with him last week Mr. Kiernan did not sound like a man gnashing his teeth about the impending Trump era. By his group?s calculations $80 billion of wind industry investment is in the pipeline for the United States over the next few years. ?We are creating jobs throughout America   jobs and we think   Trump will want that to continue? he said. If Mr. Trump really wanted to roll back the clock he could try to get Congress to override all the state mandates a gross violation of the supposed conservative commitment to federalism. But it would be a titanic fight some Republican senators would defect on principle and Mr. Trump would almost certainly lose. So if the damage Mr. Trump can do domestically is limited by circumstance what about the international effort against global warming? That is the prospect that has David G. Victor most worried. Dr. Victor a professor at the University of California at San Diego is one of the closest observers of global climate politics. While the nations of the world agreed a year ago to a landmark deal to tackle global warming that consensus is fragile he pointed out. The Paris Agreement is really an outline more promise than reality. Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw. Right now other countries are saying they will go forward even if he does so but it is not hard to imagine the thing unraveling. As part of the negotiations the Obama administration promised billions of dollars from American taxpayers to help poor countries adjust to the devastation of global warming. ?That?s a big part of the glue that held the Paris deal together? Dr. Victor pointed out. Mr. Trump is considered likely to abandon that pledge. Perhaps the biggest threat to the climate agenda posed by the incoming administration is not anything that Mr. Trump might do but rather what he will not do. While the energy transition is real it is still in its earliest stages. Iowa may soon get 40 percent of its power from wind but for the United States as a whole the figure is closer to 5 percent. The transition is simply not happening fast enough. The pledges countries made in Paris even if kept are not ambitious enough. To meet the climate goals embodied in the Paris Agreement the world needed an American president who would have pushed hard to accelerate the energy transition. You can debate whether Mrs. Clinton would have been that president but it is certainly clear that Mr. Trump will not be. So as Washington goes into reverse gear on climate policy seas will keep rising and heat waves will get worse. Later this month global monitoring agencies are expected to report that 2016 was the hottest year in the historical record beating out 2015 which beat out 2014. If nothing else the next four years may be a fascinating test of just how far politics can become divorced from physical reality.
12,17294,Can Carbon Capture Technology Prosper Under Trump? - The New York Times,New York Times,John Schwartz,1/5/2017,2017,1,,THOMPSONS Tex.  ?   Can one of the most promising  ?   and troubled  ?   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology carbon capture involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump?s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here about 30 miles southwest of Houston is a bright spot for the technology?s supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up the plant which is attached to one of the power company NRG?s hulking   units will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant the largest in the Lone Star State. Still it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  ?   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214 338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant?s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator or stripper which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration will not just grab the CO2 it will use it pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells a technique known as enhanced oil recovery that should increase production to 15 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant which has received $190 million from the federal government can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel said David Knox an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris he said: ?We?re not going to declare victory before it?s time. ? If the price of oil stabilizes or rises and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop he said utilities might ask ?why would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?? But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far problems have bedeviled major projects often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  ?   a problem known as ?parasitic load. ? The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture?s problems its supporters including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency call the technology known as carbon capture sequestration crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. ?If you don?t have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down and the cost of success goes up? said Julio Friedmann an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. ?If you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. ? Carbon capture is proving itself said David Mohler the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially he said. ?You cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  ?   you really have to do this stuff in the real world? he said. Driving down costs he noted is what engineers and businesses do through research development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. ?We do figure things out as we go? he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is at this point anyone?s guess. ?The technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere? said Mark Brownstein a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. ?I actually think it?s a moment of optimism? said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. ?What I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs? she said. ?I think he was intrigued? about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix she added. One of the pillars of Mr. Trump?s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses too were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. ?The decision they are making is not what does the political outlook look like today? What?s it look like over the life of this plant?? Although she concedes that a   revival of coal?s fortunes is unlikely carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation?s energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute which promotes the technology said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. ?I wouldn?t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry? he said but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant in La Porte Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million 50 megawatt demonstration project the company Net Power will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system invented by a British engineer Rodney Allam eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means in effect that ?the cost of being green is zero? said Bill Brown the chief executive of Net Power. ?The potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer? said Fatima Maria Ahmad a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation a power company the engineering and construction firm CBI and 8 Rivers Capital which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  ?   ?rapid unplanned disassembly?  ?   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation?s carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. ?We see this very much playing into all parts of the world? said Daniel McCarthy executive vice president for CBI?s technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture said John Coequyt global climate policy director for Sierra Club. ?This is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community? he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal with all of its environmental baggage in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don?t pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann the former energy official predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. ?It?s convenient to just say ?Keep it in the ground? ? he said referring to an   slogan. ?What I prefer to say is ?Keep it from the air. ??
13,17295,Mar-a-Lago the Future Winter White House and Home of the Calmer Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Maggie Haberman,1/2/2017,2017,1,,WEST PALM BEACH Fla.  ?   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend he did it in   opulence joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump?s    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump?s   private club in Florida where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president?s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post the cereal heiress and the property?s original owner who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973 hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump?s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite and he opened up   ?s membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump?s victory in November    has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. ?It?s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long? said Jeff Greene a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010 who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling a scene resembling a mansion in ?Sunset Boulevard? or ?Citizen Kane? two of Mr. Trump?s favorite movies. At night the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year?s Eve party on Saturday night a   white menu included ?Mr. Trump?s wedge salad? a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a ?breakfast buffet. ? Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning the men dressed in tuxedos the women in ball gowns many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks according to a guest who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump roamed the crowd with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump?s two adult sons Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC?s ?Morning Joe? were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump?s business interests the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump?s aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump?s combative public persona  ?   often on display during his campaign  ?   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. ?   is an environment he can control? said the historian Douglas Brinkley who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member Chris Ruddy the chief executive of Newsmax Media. ?I watched him hold court  ?   he was so comfortable in his own skin and so relaxed. ? Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures politicians and donors. He described the   as ?seeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease very positive very gregarious. ? Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job Rex W. Tillerson the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him ?Mr. Exxon. ?) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim the billionaire who is Mexico?s richest man. Mr. Trump his wife Melania and their    son Barron inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio a central point of action where at night a singer plays with a small band sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (?My Way? a song popularized by Frank Sinatra was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables plucking tunes like the theme from ?Fiddler on the Roof. ? Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club but grudgingly so  ?   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago preparing to play a round with David H. Koch a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner?s coming new job the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein a club member for nearly 25 years said that some club members might express frustration but that most thought it was important ?that we keep Donald and his family safe. ? Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around and expect it will continue. ?The loser in this game is Camp David? said Mr. Brinkley referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. ?Once you?re at    and it?s so opulent and   the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp David?s Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. ?
14,17296,How to form healthy habits in your 20s - The New York Times,New York Times,Charles Duhigg,1/2/2017,2017,1,,This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life?s opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. When you woke up this morning what did you do first? Did you hop in the shower check your email or grab a doughnut? What did you say to your roommates on the way out the door? Salad or hamburger for lunch? When you got home did you put on your sneakers and go for a run or eat dinner in front of the television? Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of   decision making but they?re not. They?re habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own over time the meals we eat how we spend our evenings and how often we exercise have enormous impacts. This is particularly true in our 20s when so many of our habits are still up for grabs. The patterns you establish right now will impact your health productivity financial security and happiness for decades. How much money you make how much time you spend with your friends and family how well your body functions years from now  ?   all of these in many ways are products of the habits you are building today. (Related: The 8 health habits experts say you need in your 20s) And in the last decade our understanding of the neurology of habit formation has been transformed. We?ve learned how habits form  ?   and why they are so hard to break. We now know how to create good habits and change bad ones like never before. At the core of every habit is a neurological loop with three parts: A cue a routine and a reward. To understand how to create habits  ?   such as exercise habits  ?   you must learn to establish the right cues and rewards. In 2002 researchers at New Mexico State University studied 266 individuals most of whom worked out at least three times a week. They found that many of them had started running or lifting weights almost on a whim or because they suddenly had free time or wanted to deal with unexpected stresses in their lives. However the reason they continued exercising  ?   why it became a habit  ?   was because of a specific cue and a specific reward. If you want to start running each morning it?s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or always going for a run at the same time of day) and a clear reward (like a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that at first the rewards inherent in exercise aren?t enough. So to teach your brain to associate exercise with a reward you need to give yourself something you really enjoy  ?   like a small piece of chocolate  ?   after your workout. This is counterintuitive because most people start exercising to lose weight. But the goal here is to train your brain to associate a certain cue (?It?s 5 o?clock?) with a routine (?Three miles down! ?) and a reward (?Chocolate! ?). Eventually your brain will start expecting the reward inherent in exercise (?It?s 5 o?clock. Three miles down! Endorphin rush! ?) and you won?t need the chocolate anymore. In fact you won?t even want it. But until your neurology learns to enjoy those endorphins and the other rewards inherent in exercise you need to   the process. And then over time it will become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. You won?t want the chocolate anymore. You?ll just crave the endorphins. The cue in addition to triggering a routine will start triggering a craving for the inherent rewards to come. Want more? You might also like: ? The scientific   workout ? No time to workout?

15,17297,Turning Your Vacation Photos Into Works of Art - The New York Times,New York Times,Stephanie Rosenbloom,4/14/2017,2017,4,,It?s the season for family travel and photos  ?   and perhaps enlarging some of those images of snowy landscapes or tropical getaways to decorate your home. There are of course the usual print services and methods. You can choose a glossy or matte finish print a photo on canvas or make it into a poster with a few clicks online at photo sites like Snapfish and Shutterfly professional photo shops like Adorama and Mpix or drugstores and   chains like Walgreens and Costco. But the web is also home to many   printing services as well as uncommon surfaces on which to enlarge photos for display be it burlap wood boards acrylic or    fabric. Why not try some fresh sites and methods? I recently sent some   quality iPhone vacation photos to a handful of companies that I?d never used before and had them enlarged to various sizes and printed on different surfaces. I?ve also offered some guidance about bulk digitizing those boxes of old travel photos sitting in your closet or basement so that you can begin the New Year if not with a vacation then with a   home. Of all the ways to turn photos into wall art I was most interested in trying engineer prints named for the large lightweight prints used by architects. For less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets you can make huge enlargements. Mind you it?s a particular aesthetic one that?s most likely to appeal to people who are after an industrial shabby chic or bohemian look. The paper is thin and the lines of the images are softer than a fine art print. And engineer prints need not be formally framed. People stick them to their walls with washi tape a crafting tape that comes in innumerable colors and prints or they hang the prints using wood poster rails or skeleton clips. For a while engineer prints from photos were primarily available in black and white but now you can find them in color too. One of the easiest ways to order them online is through Parabo Press which is run by Photojojo an online photography gear shop and Zoomin a photo printing service in Asia. As with all printing sites you upload your image zoom in closer if you like and then click to buy. The site?s engineer prints are 4 feet by 3 feet and cost $20 in black and white and $25 in color. I sent out two different photos to be made in black and white and they came out to my surprise beautifully. I was impressed that they were able to be enlarged to such a degree and not look blurry. And the paper (while so thin I was worried about accidentally tearing it) lends it an artful careless look rather than the expected framed print over the couch. Parabo Press is a breeze to use: It?s clean and easy to read your options are straightforward and there are no annoying upsells. The site also offers prints on metal glass newsprint and Zines (handmade magazines) calendars photo books and prints from its Risograph machine which uses   ink and is described by Parabo as having ?a cult following since its invention in 1980s Japan. ? A fabric print  ?   not soft like a bedsheet more like a place mat made of matte woven fabric  ?   is another departure from a traditional photo enlargement. Order one from a site such as SnapBox and instead of framing it you can peel and stick it on your wall. The site?s fabric posters adhere to (and can be peeled off) smooth surfaces such as untextured walls glass ceilings tile and finished wood surfaces (avoid surfaces like stucco concrete blocks brick unfinished wood canvas or freshly painted walls). SnapBox offers fabric posters in more than a dozen sizes from 4x4 to 36x54 from less than $2 to about $80. I ordered a 24x36 fabric poster for $34. 99 a discounted price thanks to a holiday coupon  ?   not cheap (you can buy fine art prints on other sites for less) but you?re printing on special material. Regardless of the cost I expected the finished product to look like the sort of cheap thing one might see in a dorm room (it sticks to walls after all) but I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric was durable and the details in the photo  ?   crevasses in a glacier onlookers on a bridge  ?   were nicely defined. SnapBox is a   site with clear instructions and pricing. In addition to fabric posters it also offers fine art prints photo books and prints on canvas and pillows. While many places can print photos on hard surfaces such as metal and acrylic printing on wood boards is less common. The grain shows through your photos which thematically speaking seems to make sense for certain subjects like nature photos taken at say the beach or in a park. But what would something more modern like a skyscraper or a tower look like on wood? I decided to give it a try and put an image of Tokyo Tower on an 8x12 board ($65). I sent the photo to PhotoBarn a family business that makes its products by hand in a ? ? in Tennessee. The result was a lovely departure from framed prints and from canvas which can sometimes make striking photos look like amateur paintings. The wood was smooth and thick and the image was crisp with a slight sheen  ?   a perfect complement to the steel of Tokyo tower and the silver and glass of surrounding skyscrapers. For the most part the site is intuitive though a few too many holiday sale buttons on the home page made for a disorienting start. PhotoBarn will also print your photos on canvas burlap and other wood products like ornaments. I noticed a number of complaints about PhotoBarn on Yelp and the Better Business Bureau website regarding shipping speeds and customer service. I didn?t have a problem but if time is of the essence you may want to check with the company before placing an order. Once you?ve turned the best of your travel photos into art it?s time to store the rest. If boxes of prints are taking up closet (and psychic) space there are plenty of sites online that will scan your old photos (as well as negatives slides and videos) so you can store them digitally. But there are several things to keep in mind. In general these sites are a pain to navigate. They?re cluttered with too much text and fine print and they offer so many options  ?   Do you want your photos scanned in order? Do you want both sides of the photo scanned?  ?   that if you don?t have a goal in mind before you go in you can quickly be overwhelmed. Decide ahead of time what exactly you want to scan how many photos you have and how you might use whatever you scan. Also note that some of these companies by default send DVDs or CDs of your digital files. Not everyone has a CD or DVD player. If you want a thumb drive instead be sure to select that option (if it?s offered) or call the company and see if it will provide one. Be aware too that it?s not unusual for these companies to have long lead times. A number of them digitize your photos in other countries so it can take weeks to get your images back. For affordable bulk scans ScanMyPhotos. com is an old standby (you can read David Pogue?s review on nytimes. com). The company will scan about 1 800 photos at 300 dpi for $145 at its headquarters in Irvine Calif. the cost of sending the photo box to you as well as the shipping of the box to ScanMyPhotos and back to you again is included in the price. That?s one of the least costly and most uncomplicated deals around. Other companies charge for shipping photo boxes. I asked a photo editor at The Times if 300 dpi is sufficient for scanning and she said that to print photos at larger sizes a higher dpi is preferable. ScanMyPhotos has such an option: a prepaid box for $259 for the same number of scans at 600 dpi instead of 300 dpi. A thumb drive is an additional $15. 95 a box. To find the best   place to scan photos and film the Wirecutter a consumer review site owned by The New York Times researched 37 different scanning services and tested the top 12 contenders. Memories Renewed took the number one spot. The company based in Minneapolis Minn. offered ?the best combination of price quality and turnaround time of any service we tested? Wirecutter said. I was planning to try the service however according to the Memories Renewed site demand is so high at the moment that the lead time for most projects is more than two months. Scanning photos of any size up to 8. 5x11 is 60 cents a photo a thumb drive is $10 for 8 GB or $15 for 16 GB. Let?s say you don?t want to ship your irreplaceable photos in the mail. Or maybe you?d rather that strangers not see your photos and home videos. You could buy a scanner and scan your photos yourself perhaps doing a batch for half an hour each day. Personally I don?t want machines around my home collecting dust (and fast becoming outdated). So I decided to try the new PhotoScan app by Google Photos. It?s free and enables users to scan prints with a smartphone. First things first: These are not   scans. If you have prized photos in need of restoration then go with a professional. However if like me you have a bunch of travel photos  ?   landscapes food monuments  ?   that you?re keeping simply because you want to remember where you were when you may want to consider trying the app instead of giving up some privacy and spending upward of $150. By and large PhotoScan is simple and quick with almost no learning curve. If you try it just make sure to hold your phone level when asked to move it over the image. Remember these words: Don?t tilt your phone! Most of the scans I made looked as good as the prints in terms of color and clarity. That said this is unlikely to be your solution if you want   prints or have thousands of photos to scan. Once you get the hang of PhotoScan using it becomes a repetitive vaguely   activity. That is unless the app crashes which it did several times. But I was still glad for it. Even when it crashed it took only the tap of a finger to begin again. And you can?t beat the price.
16,17298,As Second Avenue Subway Opens a Train Delay Ends in (Happy) Tears - The New York Times,New York Times,Emma G. Fitzsimmons,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017 and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. ?I was very choked up? Betsy Morris 70 said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station at noon. ?How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It?s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ? It was a major moment for New York?s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  ?   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  ?   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue the nation?s most overcrowded subway line which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old and strollers suitcases and dogs  ?   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement the line with just three new stops is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948 much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation?s infrastructure from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  ?   in New York Washington and Boston  ?   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway which was first proposed in the 1920s was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority which runs the city?s vast network of subways buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening the map of the city?s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations bringing the total to 472  ?   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan?s Far West Side in 2015 was the city?s first new station in a  . On Sunday New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. ?I don?t think I?ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen? she said through tears. ?This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ? She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. ?Representation matters? they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria Queens said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. ?There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York? Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013 but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a Democrat who effectively controls the authority pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still the agency made the deadline  ?   just barely  ?   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year?s Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways it is actually the governor who appoints the authority?s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority?s chairman Thomas F. Prendergast to join the first trip for regular riders who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo?s voice came over the loudspeaker. ?Rest assured: I?m not driving the train? he joked. The first day of service was smooth although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer 62 and her mother Margot Tallmer 91 contemplated visiting another day. ?We?ve been waiting for 10 years or more to ride? the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. ?Hopefully it?s almost ready for us. ? It was not and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station George Braith a jazz saxophonist was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. ?Would you look at that guy?? Mr. Braith 77 said. ?Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ? He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith?s mosaic he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. ?Are you famous?? a   asked seeing the hubbub. ?In the jazz world? Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said ?Well you?re immortalized as far as I?m concerned. ? Another   celebrant Ian Ma 15 lives in Sheepshead Bay a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child he said and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. ?I feel like I?ve been waiting for this train my whole life? he said seemingly speaking for many others.
17,17300,Dylann Roof Himself Rejects Best Defense Against Execution - The New York Times,New York Times,Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder,1/2/2017,2017,1,,  pages into the   journal found in Dylann S. Roof?s car  ?   after the assertions of black inferiority the lamentations over white powerlessness the longing for a race war  ?   comes an incongruous declaration. ?I want state that I am morally opposed to psychology? wrote the young white supremacist who would murder nine black worshipers at Emanuel A. M. E. Church in Charleston S. C. in June 2015. ?It is a Jewish invention and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they dont. ? Mr. Roof who plans to represent himself when the penalty phase of his federal capital trial begins on Tuesday apparently is devoted enough to that proposition (or delusion as some maintain) to stake his life on it. Although a defense based on his psychological capacity might be his best opportunity to avoid execution he seems steadfastly committed to preventing any public examination of his mental state or background. ?I will not be calling mental health experts or presenting mental health evidence? he wrote to Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court on Dec. 16 a day after a jury took only two hours to find him guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes resulting in death obstruction of religion and firearms violations. At a hearing on Wednesday Mr. Roof told the judge that he planned to make an opening statement but not call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf. The testimony presented by prosecutors during the guilt phase of Mr. Roof?s trial detailed with gruesome precision how he had plotted and executed the massacre during a Wednesday night Bible study in the church?s fellowship hall. It was less satisfying in revealing why he had done it. With his choice to sideline his legal team and represent himself the second phase  ?   when the same jury of nine whites and three blacks will decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison  ?   may prove little different. Death penalty experts said it was exceedingly rare for capital defendants to represent themselves after allowing lawyers to handle the initial part of a case. Mr. Roof who also faces a death penalty trial in state court has not publicly explained his reasoning. But legal filings strongly suggest a split with his   defenders about whether to argue that his rampage resulted from mental illness. Mr. Roof?s lead lawyer David I. Bruck tried repeatedly to plant that notion during the guilt phase knowing it might be his only chance. Because evidence of mitigating factors is supposed to be reserved for the penalty phase Judge Gergel allowed him little leeway. In his closing argument while acknowledging Mr. Roof?s guilt Mr. Bruck managed to tell the jury that Mr. Roof subscribed to ?the mad idea that he can make things better by massacring the most virtuous kind and gentle people he could ever have found. ? Mr. Bruck seeded his speech with words like ?abnormal? ?irrationality? ?senselessness? ?delusional? ?obsession? and ?perseveration? a psychiatric term referring to the uncontrollable repetition of a particular response. Mr. Bruck one of the country?s most experienced death penalty litigators portrayed his    client as a loner whose most meaningful relationship seemed to be with his cat who staged hundreds of photographs of himself with no sign of friends whose racial hatred was ignited by internet searches and not personal experience who could not pinpoint during his confession to the F. B. I. how many he had killed how long he had spent at the church or even what month it was who had no escape plan and left suicide notes to his parents. ?There was something in him that made him feel that he had to do it? Mr. Bruck said ?and that is as much as he knows. ? After receiving the results of a psychiatric examination in November Judge Gergel found Mr. Roof competent to stand trial  ?   meaning that he was capable of understanding the proceedings and assisting in his defense. At Mr. Bruck?s request the judge scheduled a second competency hearing for Monday but he signaled last week that he saw no reason to delay the penalty phase. The judge has repeatedly warned Mr. Roof against representing himself including immediately after the verdicts when he called it ?a bad decision? and urged him to ?fully appreciate the implications. ? The warnings have had no discernible effect on Mr. Roof who has until Tuesday to reverse his decision to relegate his lawyers to standby counsel. That status allows Mr. Bruck and his team to offer guidance but not to question witnesses or make objections. Prosecutors plan a procession of grief perhaps calling dozens of members of victims? families to testify about the impact of the killings. The prosecutors are also likely to   the considerable evidence of Mr. Roof?s premeditation and clearly articulated racial intent. Death penalty experts said the absence of mental health evidence to mitigate those aggravating factors could be decisive. ?If the jury views Roof as evil and having made a knowing intelligent choice to kill these innocent churchgoing people in order to foment racial hatred they are much more likely to impose the death penalty than if they believe him to be a young and severely mentally ill person who acted under delusional racist beliefs? said Robert Dunham executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center a research group. It would take only one holdout on the jury which consists of 10 women and two men to spare Mr. Roof from lethal injection. Judge Gergel has ruled that the jurors can be told that prosecutors had rejected Mr. Roof?s offer through Mr. Bruck to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Many in Charleston were relieved by Mr. Roof?s conviction in light of the mistrial that had been declared 10 days earlier in the state murder prosecution of Michael T. Slager the white North Charleston policeman whose fatal shooting of a black motorist in 2015 was captured on video. Even those who oppose the death penalty on moral grounds like the Rev. Joseph A. Darby a presiding elder for the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston said it would seem bewildering for Mr. Roof to escape capital punishment. ?That could very well be the end of the death penalty in America because if there was ever justification for killing anybody this is the case? Mr. Darby said. There is no consensus among members of the victims? families about Mr. Roof?s fate. When the Justice Department elected in May to seek the death penalty it acted against the wishes of many and of the two women he had spared. Five relatives offered Mr. Roof a measure of forgiveness at a remarkable bond hearing two days after the shootings. But by law those who testify now are prohibited from telling the jury what penalty they think he should receive. ?It?s going to be extremely emotional powerful testimony? said John H. Blume a death penalty expert who teaches at Cornell Law School ?and that emotion could implicitly and misleadingly indicate to the jury that some of these people want the death penalty when it?s not the case. ? If Mr. Roof is sentenced to death it will be the first time a jury has done so in a prosecution involving the federal hate crimes law according to experts on capital cases. That statute which was broadened in 2009 does not carry a potential death sentence but Mr. Roof was also convicted of other crimes that do. A death sentence most likely would give way to a yearslong series of appeals (in which Mr. Roof could not represent himself). Among the issues could be the composition of the jury given that Mr. Roof acted rather passively as his own lawyer when it was selected the withholding of evidence on mental health and other mitigating factors and Mr. Roof?s competence to stand trial and to represent himself. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in Indiana v. Edwards that trial judges could insist on legal representation for defendants who are ?competent enough to stand trial but who suffer from severe mental illness to the point where they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves. ? Mr. Bruck and his team have argued in court filings that Mr. Roof a   dropout ?has no right to represent himself in a capital trial and even less so at the penalty phase. ? But in the 41 years since the Supreme Court recognized a Sixth Amendment right of   for criminal defendants in Faretta v. California the court has never specifically narrowed that holding for death penalty trials despite their complexity. Some death penalty opponents hope that Mr. Roof?s defiance will prompt the appellate courts to adopt a more rigorous standard for capital defendants. ?Whether or not they?re legally insane there?s certainly something mentally wrong with them? said Peter D. Greenspun a lawyer who was ousted by a defendant John A. Muhammad for part of a capital murder trial for the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. He added ?To have a person like that make this kind of decision it really calls into question from a philosophical point of view whether that person is in a position to understand their civil liberties. ? Mr. Muhammad who ultimately reinstated Mr. Greenspun was sentenced to death in 2003 and executed six years later. ?It?s something that Roof will likely regret? Mr. Greenspun predicted of his choice to represent himself. ?At some point down the road he?s going to say ?What did I do?? And there?s no going back. ?
18,17301,Modi?s Cash Ban Brings Pain but Corruption-Weary India Grits Its Teeth - The New York Times,New York Times,Geeta Anand,1/2/2017,2017,1,,MUMBAI India  ?   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India which came into full effect at midnight Friday the last day for depositing the old notes at banks set off cash shortages that have hit the country?s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do for the moment at least Mr. Modi?s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled many have continued to voice support for the prime minister?s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money known as ?black money? flowing through the country?s economy in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi analysts say has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. ?Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country? said Hem Raj Chechi 39 a taxi driver in New Delhi the capital who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children?s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But he said ?We need to fight black money even though it is hurting little people like me. ? Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1 000 rupee bills worth about $8 and $15 would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year said Eswar S. Prasad an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. ?Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system? Mr. Prasad said in an interview. ?Modi in the same way did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can?t tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes really disruptive ones. ? Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year?s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi a battle of good versus evil. ?Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate? Mr. Modi said using the honorific for Gandhi. ?As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha? he said referring to Gandhi?s nonviolent resistance movement ?let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. ? Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. ?It?s a little bit crazy? said Geng Xiao a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. ?When I first read the news I couldn?t even figure out if it was true. ? The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  ?   more than 250 000 rupees or about $3 670 could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modi?s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India?s ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged the public support for Modi could wane. ?If this move damages the economy he?s in for a rough ride? said Harsh Pant the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. ?You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing? he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014 defeating the government led by the Indian National Congress party that had ruled for most of the country?s   life on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. ?In 2014 he had presented himself as the big disrupter? Mr. Pant said. ?He was the precursor to what?s happening in the West. ? Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat where he had a reputation for tearing away the country?s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election Mr. Modi whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as ?people who don?t want change who don?t want reform? Mr. Pant said forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place the currency shortage remains acute leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings many providers said. Nagender Tiwari 42 a rickshaw driver in East Delhi said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1 000 rupees or about $15 that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result his family which includes two children in 11th grade has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. ?So if bribery is not stopped how can black money be stopped?? he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal 65 a paper trader in New Delhi said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. ?We can?t shift to a cashless mode overnight? he said. Surjit Bhalla a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States for every $100 collected in income tax an estimated $20 owed is not paid he added. In India for that same $100 in taxes paid $200 more is owed he said. Collectively the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modi?s continuing to command the political narrative of the country as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. ?So far he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him? Mr. Pant said. ?He thinks he can continue to do it but we really don?t know. There are so many unknowns. ?
19,17302,Suicide Bombing in Baghdad Kills at Least 36 - The New York Times,New York Times,The Associated Press,1/3/2017,2017,1,,BAGHDAD  ?   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market killing at least 36 people hours after President Franois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers a police officer said adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande Haider   Iraq?s prime minister said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit vegetables and laborers? shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim 28 an owner of a nearby cellphone store described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber?s vehicle trying to get hired. ?Then a big boom came sending them up into the air? said Mr. Hashim who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed ?the most ineffective security forces in the world? for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital?s six million residents. ?We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who?s supposed to protect us? said Ali Abbas a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. ?If the securities forces can?t protect us then allow us to do the job. ? Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70 according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a ?  incident? without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group.
20,17303,Fecal Pollution Taints Water at Melbourne?s Beaches After Storm - The New York Times,New York Times,Brett Cole,1/3/2017,2017,1,,SYDNEY Australia  ?   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne Australia?s   city is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. ?It?s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem? said Anthony Boxshall the agency?s manager of applied sciences noting that the waste was coming from people dogs horses cows birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip affecting the city?s bayside beaches the most. The agency which takes regular water samples rates beaches. A ?good? rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. ?Fair? means that rainfall has affected the water. ?Poor? means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. ?When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach? said Sam Riley who lives in the city. ?I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer but now I?m concerned about whether the water is clean. ? Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches? water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops.
21,17305,N.F.L. Playoffs: Schedule Matchups and Odds - The New York Times,New York Times,Benjamin Hoffman,1/3/2017,2017,1,,When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11 dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to ?run the table? in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night the team fulfilled Rodgers? promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams but the N. F. C. North bragging rights and a home game in the first round of the playoffs were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team?s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks? title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions who lost their final three games blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East home of the   Dallas Cowboys the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. ?s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler was forced to leave Week 17?s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16 Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17 and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team?s quarterback Ryan Tannehill was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore and Jay Ajayi the team?s   running back they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami?s middling defense even if Tannehill?s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain threw a wrench in the Redskins? plans eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr the team?s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player to a broken leg the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That combined with the Kansas City Chiefs?   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr?s backup Matt McGloin injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker to lose to the Lions which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers having the Redskins tie the Giants the Packers lose to the Lions and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis Dallas Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.

The trouble continued when she gave up on another of her   numbers ?We Belong Together? while a recording of the song continued to play a confirmation that she had been  . But on Sunday a dispute erupted between Ms. Carey?s representatives and producers of ABC?s ?Dick Clark?s New Year?s Rockin? Eve With Ryan Seacrest? on which the singer was performing. Ms. Carey?s manager Stella Bulochnikov charged that the show?s producers had been aware of technical problems but did not fix them  ?   and chose to continue showing Ms. Carey?s messy performance ?to get ratings. ? ?I will never know the truth but I do know that we told them three times that her mike pack was not working and it was a disastrous production? Ms. Bulochnikov told Us Weekly magazine on Sunday. ?I?m certainly not calling the F. B. I. to investigate. It is what it is: New Year?s Eve in Times Square. Mariah did them a favor. She was the biggest star there and they did not have their? act together. Dick Clark Productions which produced the show issued a statement on Sunday night saying that Ms. Carey?s performance woes had nothing to do with the production and that any suggestion that the company ?would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory outrageous and frankly absurd. ? ?In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television? the statement said adding that an initial investigation suggested that the production company ?had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey?s New Year?s Eve performance. ? A veteran audio producer Robert Goldstein of Maryland Sound International a company that has worked on the Times Square event for years also said in an email that there had been no malfunctions with the sound equipment he oversaw. ?Every monitor and   device worked perfectly? Mr. Goldstein said. ? I can?t comment beyond that and don?t know what her nontechnical issue may have been. ? A spokeswoman for Ms. Carey said on Sunday that the singer was not at fault for her performance. ?Unfortunately there was nothing she could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances? the spokeswoman Nicole Perna told The Associated Press. It was a rare meltdown on national television by one of the   recording artists of all time. Ms. Carey a pop phenomenon in the 1990s who won five Grammys out of 34 nominations over the years was the final   act on ABC?s ?Dick Clark?s New Year?s Rockin? Eve With Ryan Seacrest. ? She had just finished ?Auld Lang Syne? when her star turn began to spiral out of control. ?We can?t hear? she said in the opening seconds of ?Emotions? after she sashayed down the stage before more than one million people who had gathered to watch the ball drop in Manhattan. Standing still with her left hand on her hip while music played Ms. Carey told the audience that there had not been a proper sound check before her performance. Then she said ?We?ll just sing? and noted proudly of her song ?It went to No. 1. ? But she could not manage the notes that followed and she either forgot lyrics or did not want to deliver a subpar performance. ?We?re missing some of these vocals but it is what it is? she said. ?Let the audience sing. ? ABC quickly cut to shots of the Times Square crowd as Ms. Carey tried to perform some of her choreography. She continued suggesting fixes from the stage and at one point seemed to defend herself. ?I?m trying to be a good sport here? she said. When the number ended the crowd cheered her on. ?That was  ?   ? she said pausing for effect ?amazing. ? She seemed to recover at first with ?We Belong Together? but there appeared to be another malfunction and Ms. Carey again stopped singing. But this time the prerecorded number kept playing. ?It just don?t get any better? she said and then left the stage. The cause of the problem was not immediately clear. After the performance Ms. Carey posted a mildly profane slang phrase on Twitter with an ?upset? emoji then wrote: ?Have a happy and healthy new year everybody! Here?s to making more headlines in 2017. ? An ABC spokesman said on Sunday that the network would not comment on the problems with Ms. Carey?s performance.
23,17307,Damaged by War Syria?s Cultural Sites Rise Anew in France - The New York Times,New York Times,Marlise Simons,1/1/2017,2017,1,,PARIS  ?   When the Islamic State was about to be driven out of the ancient city of Palmyra in March Yves Ubelmann got a call from Syria?s director of antiquities to come over in a hurry. An architect by training Mr. Ubelmann 36 had worked in Syria before the country was engulfed by war. But now there was special urgency for the kind of work his youthful team of architects mathematicians and designers did from their cramped offices in Paris: producing digital copies of threatened historical sites. Palmyra parts of it already destroyed by the Islamists who deemed these monuments idolatrous was still rigged with explosives. So he and Houmam Saad his Syrian colleague spent four days flying a drone with a robot camera over the crumbled arches and temples. ?Drones with four or six rotors can hover really close and register structural details every crack and hole and we can take very precise measurements? said Mr. Ubelmann who founded the company Iconem. ?This is the stuff architects and archaeologists need. ? They need it in a new push for virtual preservation that scientists archaeologists and others like Mr. Ubelmann are compiling on a large scale. The records could be used to create computer models that would show how monuments and endangered historical sites might one day be restored repaired or reconstructed. Of special interest today are ancient sites in Syria and also Iraq that have suffered from war looting and the Islamic State. ?Palmyra was very difficult? Mr. Ubelmann said. ?The terrorists were uploading videos with them blowing up monuments and smashing statues to manipulate public opinion? he said. ?We felt the best response was to magnify the pictures of these places and show their splendor and their importance to the culture. It became a war of images. ? The latest front in that war is in the exhibition halls of the Grand Palais in Paris where through Jan. 9 many of the 40 000 images he and his team took at Palmyra have become the basis for displays. Called ?Eternal Sites: From Bamiyan to Palmyra? the show aims to draw attention to the rising threats to global heritage. To underscore the exhibition?s political importance it was opened several weeks ago by President Franois Hollande of France who described it as ?an act of resistance? against terror and intolerance. Showing the beauty of the Middle Eastern heritage he said ?is the best answer to the Islamist propaganda of hate destruction and death. ?   Martinez the director of the Louvre and the lead curator of the show said the sites had been chosen because ?all are under threat from pillaging neglect or destruction and are not accessible to the public. ? He said it aimed to mobilize public opinion ?in the face of the devastation of unique heritage. ? Besides images from Palmyra the multimedia show projects enormous   photographs and videos immersing visitors in different eras including the ancient Iraqi city of Khorsabad around 700 B. C. an   mosque in Damascus and a medieval Christian citadel. Mr. Ubelmann dismissed any criticism of collaboration with the government of the Syrian president Bashar  . ?We were working pro bono not for any government but to help the archaeologists? he said. They shared their work with the Syrian archaeologists he said adding ?We also train our colleagues so they can later do this on their own. ? What is paramount is memory and potential restoration. In the last year his team has flown drones over some 20 historic sites in Syria. Recently it moved into   zones in Iraq close to the front line in the fight against the Islamic State. The team is now analyzing the war?s effects on the remains of once thriving cities dating back some 3 000 years including Nineveh Khorsabad and the thrashed temple and palace of Nimrud where the government drove out the jihadists in November. In 2015 Islamists sent out videos showing militants using sledgehammers to break reliefs of human figures and mythical winged bulls as part of their   campaign. ?Nimrud was probably the most splendid of the Assyrian cities? Layla Abdulkarim a Syrian architect said as she analyzed aerial photographs. Using drones in archaeological work is not entirely new specialists say but at a recent gathering in Paris researchers from Europe and the Middle East said they were now having to practice ?war archaeology? that is collecting reliable data from   areas. The images from the drones in war zones had proved immensely valuable. But these were barely scratching the surface. Before the war close to 150 archaeological projects were underway just in Syria researchers said. Experts from many countries are trying to assess the damage in Syria?s old cities but also in the area where the Islamic State held sway that is straddling Iraq and Syria the region that is seen as central to human history and often called the birthplace of modern economics and writing. There is an outcry for data about the havoc wreaked in Yemen by Saudi bombing. ?People are exchanging satellite images and data on blogs and other research platforms but we have no real assessment yet because so many ancient sites are not accessible? said Pascal Butterlin a professor of archaeology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Time is of the essence even in the case of    ruins Mr. Butterlin said. He has led expeditions for more than 20 years to Mari near Syria?s border with Iraq. Before fleeing the guards at Mari reported that looters had come from Iraq he said. ?We need to know what places need to be stabilized and how looters have altered the sites? he said. ?Important evidence like clandestine pits can disappear very quickly through sandstorms and erosion. ? Cheikhmous Ali a Syrian archaeologist based in France who founded the international group the Association for the Protection of Syrian Archaeology said reports of organized pillaging continued. A first wave of looting began in 2012 Mr. Ali said and looting has accelerated since 2014 with the arrival of the Islamic State. While jihadists were more motivated to destroy the artifacts they had also allowed looters to operate in exchange for money. Mr. Ali said he kept an ever changing tally of museums bombed objects carted off safes stolen. The exhibition in Paris which is drawing large crowds coincides with ?History Begins in Mesopotamia? a show at the Louvre?s regional museum in Lens. Both exhibitions highlight the French government?s active concern about cultural damage in Syria which was briefly controlled by France in the first half of the 20th century. Mr. Hollande has taken a strong interest condemning the deliberate destruction of patrimony by all sides as ?war crimes. ? This past month France offered $30 million toward a proposed $100 million fund to protect sites as fighting abates provide emergency storage for artifacts and eventually rehabilitate monuments. At the ?Eternal Sites? opening at the Grand Palais Mr. Hollande stressed that France was taking in more Syrian refugees trying to protect monuments of great historical and cultural importance did not mean ignoring the suffering of the population. ?Should we be concerned about the patrimony?? he asked. ?What is more important saving lives or saving stones? In reality these two are inseparable. ?
24,17308,George Michael?s Freedom Video: An Oral History - The New York Times,New York Times,Guy Trebay and Jacob Bernstein,1/1/2017,2017,1,,Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michael?s ?Freedom! ?90? video. Sure other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals. But the convergence of a   maker?s irresistible rhythms and lyrics a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave ?Freedom! ?90? a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a  . Directed by David Fincher who was at the start of his film career and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London the video from Mr. Michael?s 1990 album ?Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1? brought together five models  ?   Naomi Campbell Linda Evangelista Christy Turlington Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  ?   who were then the queens of fashion. It runs for six and a half minutes and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion including the stylist Camilla Nickerson the hairdresser Guido Palau the makeup artist Carol Brown and the model John Pearson. Shot in moody romantic   tones ?Freedom! ?90? had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michael?s unexpected death at 53 last Sunday. Reached by phone this week some of the participants recalled their experiences on set and some of the video?s most ardent fans reflected on its impact. Naomi Campbell model. We?d done a British Vogue cover with Peter Lindbergh with all of us. I met George in L. A. and he said: ?I?ve been told that I need to speak to you to get the girls for the video. What would it take to get you?? We were living in America so I said you?d have to fly us in basically. I said yes and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in. The night before the video I didn?t sleep at all because we did five shows for Thierry Mugler in Paris. He had 76 models and it was the big finale of him designing although none of us knew that then. The last show finished at around 3 o?clock in the morning and George was there. So from there I went back to my hotel packed my bags and went on the first flight to London. David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted. He didn?t really give us parts but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing. I was more the active one. Cindy was sultry. I don?t think any of us knew what it would become. We knew the song was a hit but we didn?t know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos the way it would affect people. We were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired. They all had great premieres back in the day. They don?t have them anymore. Not that I?ve seen. MTV?s changed. Hasn?t it? I got to see George a little bit more after that because Kate Moss was neighbors with him. When we did the Olympics he sang there in London. We all did the finale and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing ?Freedom. ? After he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice   in the garden and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together. That?s the memory I?m going to keep. Guido Palau hairdresser. I don?t know how I got the job. George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue. It was a different time then. It was a big big production a   video because they had to bring in all the girls. Every girl had a day though Christy and Linda were there together. My part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were. They weren?t playing characters. They were playing themselves. And each had their own personality: Linda the comedian Christy much more classic Cindy the pinup Tatjana this kind of film noir and Naomi a very strong kind of woman. We extracted that from them. They weren?t prodded at all though there were some surprises like Linda?s hair which she?d done for a job for someone else. It wasn?t like I said ?Oh dye your hair blond? not at all. At the time we really didn?t realize how iconic the video would become. I was probably a bit nave about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a   job for me. What I remember most is the days being very long and at the end of the day the red wine would come out. There we?d be in the location van drinking and singing with George. Tatjana Patitz model. I was in my own zone. I had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day. The feel of the set was so   this big loft kind of vibe. There was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket. I think I may have had a bustier on. And I was smoking even. People still smoked in videos then and even in films. George Michael wasn?t on the set the day I was there but I?d met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine  ?   I?m trying to remember what magazine it was. So many magazines have come and gone. Glamour was very present in fashion in those days feminine glamour people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the ?40s and ?50s  ?   Audrey Hepburn Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers. It was very different those days. The business was much smaller and wasn?t as saturated not as fast as it is now. Models were known by their first names and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film. We were part of the entertainment industry which made it really fun. George was very nice almost a little shy. Maybe that?s the wrong word. He was mellow and kind. I was quite   at the time because I grew up with Wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes. In the five or so times I met him he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid not one of those vivacious   people who take a room by storm. I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter. I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that. It?s funny. A lot of people were using models in videos then but this one in particular stood the test of time. It?s not like you look at ?Freedom! ?90? now and say ?Oh my God it?s so ?80s!? It?s not like ?Working Girl. ? John Pearson model. My agent called up and said: ?Hey do you want to do this video? All the big girls are doing it. ?? Of course I said yes. I was a big George Michael fan. I used to see him all the time in London at the clubs. I arrived at the studios at 3 o?clock in the afternoon and met David Fincher briefly and then basically sat around all day and watched while Christy and Linda were being shot. There?s one shot where Linda puts her head underneath her sweater that?s amazing. That wasn?t rehearsed. Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way never cheap and tawdry. George was there very warm and nice but very shy. The day went long and the producer said at the end of the day ?Can we shoot you tomorrow?? I didn?t have another job booked so I said ?Sure. ? Then he said ?Do you mind doing it for nothing?? I said ?No way. ? It was a little bit bolshie of me but I knew what the girls were getting. In the end I was paid $15 000 for the day which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous beautiful girls. But I?d been working nonstop for three years and I wasn?t going to do it for free. And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy    jobs everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models. I really didn?t realize how big it all was at the time. Candis Cayne actress model and former drag personality. There was a group of girls in N. Y. C. in the ?90s and we didn?t want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels. Linda and Naomi and Christy. So when the video of ?Freedom!? came out and they were all in it we were obsessed. I used to do shows at Boy Bar so I decided I was going to do ?Freedom!? and got Lina and Mistress Formika and Sherry Vine to play the various parts. I was Linda. She was my favorite. We did the whole thing naked under white sheets. After the very last chorus we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas. That song meant a lot to us. There were singers we knew were gay then but no one really talked about it. We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were whether it was Madonna with ?Vogue? and ?Truth or Dare? or George Michael with ?Freedom!? I don?t know if he was openly gay or not then. I guess not. But it was almost O. K. because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time. It was so oppressive particularly when you factor in the AIDS epidemic. To be open would have been a career killer. But going to a club listening to ?Freedom! ? it was an escape. Alan Hunter one of the original MTV V. J. s. It was a funny moment in my life. I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didn?t know where my career had gone. I?d left MTV. My agent wasn?t calling. I was depressed. And I turned on the radio and on came George Michael?s new song. It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills. It was such a brilliant   capstone I?d ever heard. It was his    song. He was saying ?Everything that brought me to pop stardom I now disavow. ? Then I saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography he?d used in his past and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them. The leather jacket he?d worn and the jukebox from ?Faith. ? And he just steps away. He wasn?t even in the video. It showed how serious he was even while he said it all with a lot of love. It was such a joyous song. I actually felt happy. Zac Posen fashion designer. I was 10 years old 10 or 11. I?d see it in my living room waiting for Madonna to come on. I probably wanted to be the child in ?Open Your Heart. ? But what I remember about ?Freedom!? was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge. Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial Corinne Day   space. There?s water dripping down the walls and George Michael?s leather jacket is on fire and the models are naked. It was really the glamour of the ?80s transitioning into something more raw that was to come.
25,17309,With New Congress Poised to Convene Obama?s Policies Are in Peril - The New York Times,New York Times,Jennifer Steinhauer,1/2/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   The most powerful and ambitious   Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life  ?   refashioning the country?s social safety net wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration. Even before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 giving their party full control of the government Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities  ?   most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act?s repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a   Supreme Court seat which is sure to set off a pitched showdown and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump?s cabinet nominees. ?It?s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results? said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader. ?And we intend to do it. ? But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party?s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference Mr. Trump?s   cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday he offered New Year?s wishes ?to all? including ?those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don?t know what to do. ?) Obstacles will also come from Republicans who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals like vast changes to Medicare that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved  ?   the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader Bob Dole who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. ?They?ve been given a golden opportunity here? said Trent Lott the former Republican Senate majority leader. ?But I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House and the danger is overplaying your hand. ?If you go too far like what happened with Obamacare and you get no support at all from the other side you have a problem? Mr. Lott continued. ?You have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ? The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump?s chief of staff Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support at least some of the time. But on many issues Senate Democrats  ?   including their new leader Chuck Schumer of New York  ?   are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump?s agenda. ?After campaigning on a promise to help the middle class   Trump?s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he?s sworn in? said Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington. ?Democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ? Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules many   that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. ?I hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else? the House speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said at a recent forum. ?I think if we can provide regulatory relief right away that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ? In late December the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. That regulation one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it using the obscure Congressional Review Act which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules? completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  ?   already a quarter over  ?   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama?s and they may delay the repeal measure?s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump?s cabinet picks and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However they cannot do much more than that because when they were in charge they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously such nominations could face a filibuster which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump?s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because she said her schedule got too busy. ?The senator doesn?t want to rush? said her spokesman Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell?s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats  ?   and some Republicans who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  ?   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation the party?s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. ?This is no time for hubris? Mr. McConnell said. ?You have to perform. ?
26,17311,Republicans Stonewalled Obama. Now the Ball Is in Their Court. - The New York Times,New York Times,Carl Hulse,1/3/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   It?s   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation?s health care delivery system restructure the tax code drive job creation muscle up American foreign policy rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. ?When you have both houses and the presidency there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation? said Representative Tom Cole a senior Republican from Oklahoma. ?There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ? That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate in a climate that is in many respects even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland?s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  ?   at least for now. Perhaps most important Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now if they can assemble the votes their ideas will become law  ?   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit approve annual budgets endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans the Republicans who belonged to the ?vote no hope yes? caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn?t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections and in the Senate in 2014 this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. ?A Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress? Senator Cory Gardner Republican of Colorado said in the party?s weekly radio address on Saturday. ?We assume that responsibility with the promise that we?ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ? ?I am pretty giddy? said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it.

28,17313,Inside Trump Defense Secretary Pick?s Efforts to Halt Torture - The New York Times,New York Times,Sheri Fink and Helene Cooper,1/5/2017,2017,1,,The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003 outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The    man had been beaten deprived of sleep forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis   Donald J. Trump?s nominee for secretary of defense was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death which led to   and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. ?General Mattis was all up in arms over this? Ralph Dengler then a lieutenant colonel testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart had immediately described the death as ?the worst thing that happened? under his watch in the Iraq war. ?I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it considering many of the other deaths including American deaths? Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the general?s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump in a New York Times interview in late November said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country?s 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the   practice of waterboarding adding that ?only a stupid person would say it doesn?t work. ? General Mattis does not support abusive techniques let alone waterboarding. ?Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers? he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November according to the   ?and I do better with that than I do with torture. ? The general?s beliefs were shaped by his military training but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment according to an examination of his nearly   career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor who was General Mattis?s spokesman during much of that time said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles ?makes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask ?What am I fighting for? ?? Colonel Taylor said. ?That is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of? he added. As a young officer General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war including the Geneva Conventions which among other protections require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college  ?   part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War  ?   he did not deploy to Vietnam. But several friends say he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006 General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. ?Torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option even if lives depend on gaining information? the manual said. ?Lose moral legitimacy lose the war. ? General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees  ?   including waterboarding forced nudity and sensory deprivation tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency which later fell under the general?s command. That program Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape also known as SERE exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq and as an overall leader of the American war effort General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. ?s treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guantnamo Bay Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement General Mattis opposed the release before the end of hostilities of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However he added they should be treated humanely in accordance with international and domestic law. ?I would go by the Geneva Conventions and maintain them with Red Cross oversight until the war is over? he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence the general felt. ?For his whole career he?s believed that it just doesn?t pay dividends? said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The ?pack of cigarettes? reference according to people who served with the general reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable and that   can go a long way. ?I?m not in his head but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture? Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump?s transition team declined requests for more detail on the  ?s discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis?s beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration?s departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques  ?   government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions  ?   tainted the United States? reputation while not yielding results. ?Ineffective war crime against our values moral high ground et cetera? Donald J. Guter a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. ?A very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured and we have no basis to object. If we torture we?ve lost who we are. ? The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example the Army field manual?s section on intelligence collection states: ?Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. ? The manual adds ?Cruel inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. ? As a commander in Iraq General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the   invasion. The prisoner who died Nagem Sadoon Hatab had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch a    private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an   rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to     treatment  ?   forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired stressed and submissive for interrogators witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and  . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling screaming and banging from the interrogation room a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6 2003 Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis Col. William B. Gallo later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab if any might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo?s opinion the   treatment did not amount to torture but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent had been lost or destroyed complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines a major and a sergeant were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab?s death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners which resulted in a ban of   tactics including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: ?No better friend no worse enemy. ? The addition was ?First do no harm. ?
29,17314,ISIS Claims Responsibility for Istanbul Nightclub Attack - The New York Times,New York Times,Tim Arango,1/3/2017,2017,1,,ISTANBUL  ?   The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year?s Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people describing the gunman who carried out the assault  ?   and who has not been identified or captured  ?   as ?a hero soldier of the caliphate. ? The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a   rifle but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman captured by security cameras that showed a   cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The government?s spokesman Numan Kurtulmus said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant?s fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning Mr. Kurtulmus said: ?The fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is ?We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.? And we say to them we will break into your caves wherever you are. ? The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan as saying ?According to preliminary information this information is doubtful but we are checking all the same. ? The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out ?in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey the protector of the cross. ? ?A hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday? read the statement from the Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL. ?They used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. ? In an apparent reference to Turkey?s role in the conflict in Syria the statement warned that ?the government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims which it is targeting with its planes and its guns will cause a fire in its home by God?s will. ? The statement did not name the assailant and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a   State group the Nashir Media Foundation published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs markets and movie theaters. The Islamic State?s claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border. Several terrorist attacks in Turkey over the last year have been attributed to the Islamic State but the militant group rarely claims responsibility for major attacks in the country. A rare exception came in November when the group claimed to be behind a deadly car bombing in southeastern Turkey. Analysts said that the Islamic State has walked a fine line in Turkey trying to balance its goal of destabilizing the country without antagonizing the government to the extent that it would crack down heavily. For years Turkey looked the other way according to analysts and regional diplomats as jihadist groups moved fighters and supplies across the border establishing deep networks in Turkish border towns. Committed to supporting the uprising against President Bashar   of Syria Turkey felt the jihadists could be managed while they fought with forces loyal to the Syrian government. But that policy ultimately changed as Turkey worked to secure its borders under pressure from its allies as it took in millions of Syrian refugees and as terrorist attacks rocked the country. Turkey began a military intervention in northern Syria in August that put its forces on the front lines against Kurdish militants as well as Islamic State fighters. This turned the jihadists decidedly against Turkey prompting their leaders to call for attacks there. The Turkish military said on Monday that it had struck Islamic State targets in Syria killing at least 22 militants. American intelligence officials had recently expressed concern about a possible attack in Turkey warning in a statement on Dec. 22 that extremist groups were ?continuing aggressive efforts to conduct attacks throughout Turkey? in areas where American citizens and expatriates lived or visited. That warning came three days after a gunman described by Turkish officials as a      police officer assassinated Andrey G. Karlov the Russian ambassador to Turkey at an art gallery in the capital Ankara. The gunman shouted ?God is great!? and ?Don?t forget Aleppo don?t forget Syria!? during the attack which was captured on video. The   Anadolu news agency said that 38 of the 39 people who died in the attack on Sunday had been identified The Associated Press reported. At least two dozen of the people killed were said to be foreigners.
30,17317,The Afghan War and the Evolution of Obama - The New York Times,New York Times,Mark Landler,1/17/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   President Obama?s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama?s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. ?The fever in this room has finally broken? the president told the group according to a person in the meeting. ?We?re no longer in   mode. ? What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day himself included thought that the United States  ?   after 14 years of war billions of dollars spent and more than 2 000 American lives lost  ?   would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time he added ?the counterterrorism challenges are real. ? As bleak as Afghanistan?s prospects were the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan  ?   the ?good war? to George W. Bush?s ?bad war? in Iraq  ?   had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had through bitter experience become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. ?We shouldn?t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy? the president said in an interview in September. Now as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech ?that war is sometimes necessary and war at some level is an expression of human folly. ? More than any other conflict Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama?s thinking on the basic questions of war peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq Syria Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. ?When it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people we have to understand? he said in the interview ?that this is a long slog. ? Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a ?dumb war. ? But in the same speech he also said ?I don?t oppose all wars. ? He was referring to Afghanistan which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ?I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again? he told the crowd that day in Chicago?s Federal Plaza. By July 2008 as the Democratic nominee for president Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq  ?   the ?good war? in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration?s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. ?This is a war that we have to win? he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades or roughly 10 000 soldiers to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50 000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country ?precarious and urgent. ? More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008 a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009 he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17 000 additional troops to Afghanistan bringing the total to nearly 70 000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009 with the Taliban showing increased strength Mr. Obama?s military commanders backed by the elders on his war council including Hillary Clinton then his secretary of state were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq  ?   a     expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads bridges schools and a   government. The strategy known by its acronym COIN would require as many as 40 000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan his advisers told him. ?There was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war? said Vali R. Nasr a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. ?I don?t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan and to assert what would be his worldview. ? ?In many ways I think he deferred? said Mr. Nasr now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan he placed a strict timetable on the mission saying they would have to be withdrawn again starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number  ?   20 000 for example  ?   look like a path to certain defeat. ?President Obama was asking the military for broad options? said Karl W. Eikenberry a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama?s ambassador to Kabul. But he said the military gave Mr. Obama only ?variations? on ?the more robust counterinsurgency model. ? Mr. Eikenberry who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? ?When he came in everyone knew we were going to do more? Mr. Eikenberry said. ?But what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define. ? Given Mr. Obama?s innate wariness of   it didn?t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge in the spring of 2010 David H. Petraeus the commander of the Pentagon?s Central Command and an architect of the strategy was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while then cut him off. ?We can?t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar? he curtly told General Petraeus according to people in the room. ?Obama believes the military can do enormous things? said Benjamin J. Rhodes the deputy national security adviser. ?It can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can?t create a political culture or build a society. ? By the end of his first term Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept ?Afghan good enough. ? The phrase which had been kicked around the White House since 2010 referred to the shift away from   to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010 100 000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign Ryan Crocker a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011 recalled thinking ?Wow this place looks great!? The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama?s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1 2012 Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014 when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan?s security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an ?enduring partnership? between the United States and Afghanistan with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base he suggested that America?s experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. ?One year ago from a base here in Afghanistan our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden? he said. ?The goal I set  ?   to defeat Al Qaeda and deny it a chance to rebuild  ?   is now within our reach. ? Earlier Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship  ?   on an earlier trip Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government  ?   and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was ?very aloof almost cold which bothered me a bit because I?d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us. ? Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a   security agreement with Washington Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner it was impossible for the United States to succeed no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries from Pakistan to Israel where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. ?The most underappreciated part of foreign policy? Mr. Rhodes said ?is dealing with flawed partners. ? When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015 the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State also known as ISIS or ISIL which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. ?The mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited? said Daniel F. Feldman who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. ?ISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan? Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama he said was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The   Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama?s war council met that August morning the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009 argued that the country would revert to chaos regardless of how long the United States stayed there. ?It doesn?t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now? he declared according to those in the room. He was he conceded a ?broken record? on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative General Dempsey told Mr. Obama was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend ?well beyond your presidency? according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line he said with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the   fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. ?This goes to the politics of what I?m leaving for the next president? he told the group according to one of the participants. ?My interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X? he added referring to troop numbers ?but to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision. ? Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had after all reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10 000 from more than 100 000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with he said and America was never going to fix it. ?Afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be? Mr. Obama said. The country ?was riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It?s still there. ? In the end Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare  ?   a chronic conflict across an arc of unstable states in which the United States is a participant if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. ?It?s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting and a war being officially over? he said. ?As commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world? he went on ?I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I?m not satisfied we?ve got it perfect yet. ?
31,17318,Tips for Your Post-Holiday Clutter Purge - The New York Times,New York Times,Michelle Higgins,4/11/2017,2017,4,,With the year winding down and New Year?s resolutions just around the corner it?s time to gear up for that   clutter purge. But the thought of tackling the kitchen junk drawer  ?   or even taking down the decorations  ?   can be overwhelming. So to help motivate you several organizing professionals offered tips on how to streamline your closets beat back the toys taking over the living room and yes finally deal with that junk drawer. START WITH THE HOLIDAY TRAPPINGS To keep plastic ornaments and Hanukkah candles organized use small containers you already have on hand like popcorn and cookie tins or empty shoeboxes and egg cartons. Wrap fragile ornaments in leftover tissue paper or newspaper or invest in storage containers like archival ornament boxes from the Container Store. For strings of lights and garlands use zip ties to avoid tangles and put them in plastic bags labeled according to use (tree lights porch lights balcony bushes etc. ). Zip ties can also be used on wreaths so that they can be hung on coat hangers and covered with plastic garment bags from the dry cleaner. To avoid a stockpile of holiday cards ?save only those that are meaningful and special? Tova Weinstock a professional organizer in Brooklyn said. ?For the others appreciate them as you receive them and then kindly send them to the trash. ? EDIT YOUR CLOSET Eliminating clothes you never wear is easier said than done. ?I don?t believe in ?If you haven?t used or worn something in a year get rid of it?? said Laura Cattano another organizer in Brooklyn. ?How you want to live moving forward is a much better guide for editing than whether or not you actually have used something in the past. ? Focus on the image you would like to project she said then start at one end of the closet and review each piece pulling out those you know you can toss donate or sell. Try on anything you haven?t worn in a while and consider how it makes you feel or if it could be styled differently. Clothes you have forgotten about could be ?your new favorite thing? she said while there may be some pieces you wear all the time that should be retired. (If you subscribe to the Marie Kondo method of decluttering ask yourself ?Does it ?spark joy? ??) Sort clothes by type grouping pants together then shirts or blouses jackets or dresses. ?If you can?t see it you won?t wear it? said Sharon Lowenheim an organizer on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the founder of the Organizing Goddess. ?So remove dry cleaning bags and hang only one item per hanger. ? Arranging shirts by sleeve length with the shortest at the front makes them easier to find said Ms. Lowenheim who also subscribes to a rotation method: selecting garments to wear from the front of each section then hanging them up toward the back after they are cleaned. ?If you find yourself continually bypassing an item at the front that is a signal to you that you just don?t like that item? she said. ?Get rid of it. ? Another way to keep your closet streamlined is to store   clothes out of sight said Faith Roberson an organizer in Manhattan and the founder of Organize With Faith. When clothes have been put away for half the year and you?ve done fine without them ?it changes your perspective? she said. ?You can honestly ask yourself ?Do I actually love this piece? And if I don?t why am I holding onto it? ?? TACKLE THE TOYS Organizing pros agree that the best way to keep toys from taking over is to get children involved in selecting some to donate. ?Finding a charity that provides toys to less fortunate children is very motivating for a child? said Ms. Lowenheim whose    daughter purged her playthings in this manner before each birthday and holiday starting when she was a toddler. Before that Ms. Lowenheim said she would sneak into her daughter?s room while she was sleeping to gather up the games and stuffed animals she was no longer playing with. ?When she was around 3 she started noticing if something was missing and would ask me about it? Ms. Lowenheim said. ?At that point I realized that I had to involve her in the process. ? If they cooperate be sure to respect their decision Ms. Roberson said even if they choose something you wouldn?t have. ?Parents think about the money they?ve spent? she said or the sentimental value which can make them reluctant to let go of that American Girl doll or the train set from Aunt Joan. Another strategy is to encourage them to sell the toys they no longer play with either online or at a garage sale and keep the proceeds for themselves. Once the toys have been pared down Ms. Roberson swears by clear shoe or sweater drawers for storage. ?They are stackable they have dividers are easy to clean easy to label and they come in four different sizes? she said. To help maintain order ?label where each toy goes? said Ms. Lowenheim who recommends installing a tall bookcase and putting paints jigsaw puzzles and other games that tend to leave a mess on the highest shelf. If your child is too young to read label the containers with stickers or pictures. If everything has ?a home? to return to at the end of the day she said cleanup will be easier. AND THAT JUNK DRAWER . .. ?Don?t waste your time standing over the drawer sifting through it piece by piece? Ms. Roberson said. Dump everything onto the floor or countertop divide it into piles and then ask yourself: Do I want it? Does it work? Does it need to be in the junk drawer? If not where else could it go? ?Take it easy and go pile by pile? she said. Put things where they belong (like that miniature tube of toothpaste you got from the dentist that should go in your toiletries bag) and discard things you don?t need like old keys and expired batteries and coupons. To ward off atrophy buy a drawer organizer suggested Ms. Lowenheim who uses expandable drawer organizers from Staples in her own home. ?The key thing is to measure the drawer then find the organizer that best fits the space? she said. ?If it?s too small it won?t help. ? The reward? ?Keeping everything sorted by type? she said ?will make it easier for you to find something when you need it. ?
32,17319,Benjamin Netanyahu Questioned in Israel Graft Inquiry - The New York Times,New York Times,Isabel Kershner,1/3/2017,2017,1,,JERUSALEM  ?   Israeli police investigators questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for three hours at his official residence on Monday evening on suspicion of receiving illicit gifts and favors from business executives. Mr. Netanyahu was questioned ?under caution? the police said in a statement implying that there were grounds to suspect that Mr. Netanyahu might have committed a criminal offense. ?No further details can be given at this stage? the statement added. The Ministry of Justice said late Monday that Mr. Netanyahu had been questioned by investigators from Lahav 433 a police fraud investigation and prosecution unit with the authorization of the attorney general Avichai Mandelblit. In a detailed statement the ministry described how the police had gathered testimony from dozens of witnesses some abroad and seized documents during a monthslong graft inquiry. While some aspects of the inquiry did not yield evidence of crimes the statement said other parts warranted a deeper investigation. Mr. Netanyahu who has been subject to police inquiries and investigations in the past that ended without charges has vehemently denied any impropriety. ?This will all come to nothing because there is nothing? he has said repeatedly of the latest accusations. Local news outlets say the investigators are focused on two separate cases one more serious than the other but they have offered little detail on the more serious one. The less weighty one according to reports in the newspaper Haaretz and other outlets concerns favors for Mr. Netanyahu and possibly for members of his family given by Israeli and foreign business executives. The Israeli police took testimony from Ronald S. Lauder a conservative American businessman and philanthropist and a close friend of Mr. Netanyahu?s when he came to Israel in late September to attend the funeral of Shimon Peres the former prime minister and president. Upon Mr. Lauder?s arrival in Israel he was asked to meet with the Israeli police ?and respond to questions related to an investigation to which Mr. Lauder is not a party? Helena Beilin a Tel   lawyer representing Mr. Lauder said in a statement. ?After a short meeting the following day he was told that his presence was no longer needed and that there would be no need for additional meetings. This remains the case. ? Mr. Netanyahu?s office suggesting that he is the victim of a witch hunt issued a statement over the weekend berating the news organizations for what it described as premature and politically motivated reports. ?Try to replace the prime minister at the ballot boxes as is accepted in democracies? it added. In televised remarks on Monday afternoon Mr. Netanyahu told legislators from his conservative Likud Party in Parliament ?We hear the celebratory spirit and winds blowing through the television studios and in the corridors of the opposition. ? ?Hold off the celebrations don?t rush? he added. ?I?ve told you before and will tell you again  ?   this will come to nothing because there is nothing. ? Mr. Netanyahu is serving his third consecutive term in office and his fourth over all. He has exuded confidence lately lashing out at journalists who have been critical of him talking up Israel?s diplomatic and economic achievements and calling in the United States ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro for a dressing down late last month after the Obama administration decided not to use its veto to shield Israel from a United Nations Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyahu generally a popular prime minister has developed a combative relationship with the local mainstream news media. After years of tension with the Obama administration he also appears buoyed by the prospect of a partnership with   Donald J. Trump who seems more sympathetic to Israeli government policies on issues like settlements. For Mr. Netanyahu?s opponents the prospect of a possible indictment has provided a glimmer of hope even though elections are not scheduled until late 2019. ?This creates an unusual dynamic in Israeli politics? said Nahum Barnea a political columnist for the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth and a critic of Mr. Netanyahu. On the one hand Mr. Barnea said there were already signs that Netanyahu loyalists would try to promote legislation banning investigations of sitting prime ministers. On the other he said the question of who might succeed Mr. Netanyahu who has no natural heir in his party was bound to be raised. Opposition leaders were fairly subdued in their initial response. Isaac Herzog the leader of the Zionist Union and of the opposition in Parliament said it was ?a tough day for Israel when a prime minister is under investigation. ? He added ?We are not expressing satisfaction at another?s misfortune. ? Mr. Herzog has also been the subject of police investigations over campaign funding. Yair Lapid the leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party which has challenged Likud in recent polls said ?The presumption of innocence applies to every Israeli including the prime minister. ? He called for a swift investigation for the sake of the country saying ?A person who is being investigated is a person under pressure. ? Israeli prime ministers are not obligated to step down while under investigation unless they are charged with a crime. Nonetheless the accusations could chip away at Mr. Netanyahu?s standing. His predecessor Ehud Olmert was forced from power in 2008 under the weight of police investigations and accusations of corruption although he remained in office as a caretaker prime minister until early elections could be held in 2009. In February Mr. Olmert became the first former Israeli prime minister to enter prison. He is serving a   term for bribery and obstruction of justice. Mr. Netanyahu described Mr. Olmert in 2008 as a ?prime minister up to his neck in investigations? and said he could not be trusted to make fateful decisions under the circumstances because they might be based on personal rather than national interests. Since the 1990s Mr. Netanyahu?s political career has been dogged by inquiries into his conduct and that of people around him though no charges have been filed against him. The inquiries have ranged from scandals involving travel expenses and garden furniture  ?   the Netanyahus were suspected of having switched a new set bought for the prime minister?s official residence with an identical old set in their private home in Caesarea  ?   to a more recent one involving a   deal with Germany for the acquisition of submarines. That agreement came under scrutiny after it became known that Mr. Netanyahu?s personal lawyer also represents the Israeli agent of the German shipyard that builds the submarines and other naval equipment purchased by Israel giving rise to suspicion of a conflict of interest. In that episode too Mr. Netanyahu and the lawyer David Shimron have denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Netanyahu?s relationship with Arnaud Mimran a French tycoon who was convicted of fraud last year and who testified that he had contributed a large sum of money to Mr. Netanyahu for his 2009 election campaign has also prompted suspicions of impropriety.
33,17321,France Lets Workers Turn Off Tune Out and Live Life - The New York Times,New York Times,Alissa J. Rubin,1/3/2017,2017,1,,PARIS  ?   If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations universal health care and fine food and wine the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created ?right to disconnect. ? Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on   email after hours it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer?s demands intrude on evenings at home treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family. ?Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office? Myriam El Khomri the minister of labor said last year in justifying the need for the law. ?The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous? and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent she said. The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world. The new provision in the labor law does not ban   emails but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or   hours. Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the ?reply all? function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond rather than half the office. Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  ?   several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots but also a commitment to personal liberties France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce. While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year and sometimes far longer because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature. Now if both members of the couple agree on the divorce lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved. Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  ?   27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  ?   but the country is now following many others in requiring ?neutral packaging? for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking. At least two new laws demonstrate the country?s gradual move toward more sustainable products. Instead of thin plastic bags French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a   synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused or paper bags. At Monoprix a supermarket chain paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters. More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers. It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago it took quite some time to change the culture although Lyon is now considered a model. In 2019 the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  ?   a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes. A new   law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods like frozen dinners to be labeled ?produit d?origine franaise? only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk. Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born raised and butchered. A product with more than 50 percent foreign milk must say where it was collected and turned into the product being sold. It seems that the French version of ?Made in America? is ?Raised in France. ?
34,17323,Airline Pilot Believed to Be Drunk Is Pulled From Cockpit in Canada - The New York Times,New York Times,Ian Austen,1/3/2017,2017,1,,OTTAWA  ?   It was 7 a. m. and 99 passengers and six crew members were aboard a 737 on the tarmac at Calgary International Airport bound for a sunny holiday in Cancun Mexico. There was one problem however. The flight?s captain was passed out in the cockpit apparently from drinking. The police in Calgary Alberta arrested the pilot Miroslav Gronych 37 on Saturday and have charged him with two   offenses. ?This is a new one and obviously this had a very significant potential to cause great harm had the pilot actually been allowed to fly this plane? Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey of the Calgary Police Service said at a news conference. ?There?s just so many checks and balances it just doesn?t surprise me that he got caught before this plane was able to leave the gate. ? Nevertheless Inspector Ken Thrower the commander of the Calgary Police Service?s traffic and airport unit said his officers along with airport officials and inspectors from Transport Canada the aviation regulator will begin trying to figure out how the pilot managed to pass through several checkpoints including airport security while obviously inebriated. Mr. Gronych was charged with two criminal offenses: having care and control of an aircraft while impaired and having care and control of an aircraft while testing for more than 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. ?He was pretty high? Sergeant Stacey said adding that it was inconceivable that the pilot had followed Transport Canada regulations that bar drinking or drug use by pilots within eight hours of a flight. The aircraft was operated by Sunwing Airlines a   carrier based in Toronto. Sunwing?s gate agents found the pilot?s behavior to be unusual and alerted the  . The   then discovered the pilot slumped in the captain?s seat and ?severely impaired by alcohol? Sergeant Stacey said. Transport Canada which did not respond to requests for comment is conducting a separate investigation which is likely to result in additional charges the police said. Inspector Thrower said Mr. Gronych is from Slovenia and is in Canada on a work visa. He will appear in court again on Thursday. After some delay the flight did take off with a new crew. Sunwing did not respond to requests for comment. Janine Massey a spokeswoman told The Associated Press that the carrier was ?very apologetic for any upset that this has caused and would like to assure our customers that safety remains our utmost priority. ?
35,17324,Riot by Drug Gangs in Brazil Prison Leaves at Least 56 Dead - The New York Times,New York Times,Simon Romero,1/16/2017,2017,1,,RIO DE JANEIRO  ?   A prison riot involving gangs vying for supremacy over the cocaine trade in the Brazilian Amazon left at least 56 people dead the authorities in the city of Manaus said on Monday. Riots at Brazil?s prisons are common but the episode in Manaus which involved decapitated bodies being thrown over the walls of the penitentiary ranks among the bloodiest in recent decades. Officials expressed dismay over the scenes of slaughter in the Compaj prison which held more than 1 200 inmates about triple its official capacity. ?I never saw anything like this in my life? Judge Lus Carlos Valois who helped negotiate an end to the riot said in a Facebook post. He said that dozens of people had been killed but that it was challenging to arrive at a precise count: ?There were lots of bodies. Many of them were dismembered. ? The riot flared on Sunday and lasted about 17 hours raising fears of even greater violence on the streets of Manaus the largest city in the Amazon basin with a population of about 2. 1 million. Manaus has emerged as a brutal battleground between two prison gangs that are contesting control of the drug trade in the region. The authorities said that one of the gangs Familia do Norte (Family of the North) which operates from the Manaus prisons was responsible for the vast majority of the killings during the riot. The targets were from First Capital Command a much larger rival gang commonly known by its Portuguese initials P. C. C. which has its roots in the prisons of So Paulo in southeast Brazil. ?There were deaths only on one side? Srgio Fontes the top security official in Amazonas State told reporters. ?The Familia do Norte massacred members of the First Capital Command and one or another guys who weren?t on their good side at the moment. ? The riot drew comparisons with the 1992 uprising at the Carandiru prison in So Paulo when police forces stormed the building and 111 inmates were killed. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings raising criticism from human rights groups. Since that episode the Brazilian authorities have vowed to alleviate overcrowding in the country?s prisons and combat prison gangs. But soaring numbers of convictions for relatively minor drug offenses have pushed prison populations upward the gangs? clout is growing and riots continue to erupt frequently all over the country. In the riot in Manaus inmates took dozens of fellow prisoners hostage. They also seized 12 employees of Umanizzare a private contractor that operates prisons in the Amazon. Negotiators eventually won the release of the hostages by assuring the inmates that they would not be harmed or transferred to other prisons. Security specialists say that Brazil could experience more riots like the one in Manaus as P. C. C. the So Paulo gang extends its reach around the country. Familia do Norte the Manaus gang recently formed an alliance with Red Command a gang that has been losing ground to P. C. C. in parts of Rio de Janeiro.
36,17325,SpaceX Says It?s Ready to Launch Rockets Again - The New York Times,New York Times,Kenneth Chang,1/2/2017,2017,1,,After the explosion in September of one of its rockets SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space the company announced on Monday with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday. In a statement SpaceX  ?   or more formally Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  ?   said that an investigation had determined the likely cause: an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum. The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence. The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations  ?   the fueling of propellants  ?   about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.) The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the   rocket and in less than a tenth of a second that section was in flames followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa. Under current federal laws investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration the United States Air Force NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites. With few obvious clues to the explosion the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor?s building nearby. ?The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis? SpaceX said in its statement. The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the   liquid oxygen tank. The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers. During launch as the liquid oxygen is consumed the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank. In December 2015 SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees 40 degrees colder than what is typically used. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser which improves engine thrust. But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool they shrink at different rates opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid. ?Really surprising problem that?s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry? Elon Musk the chief executive of SpaceX said in an interview on CNBC in November. Both carbon and aluminum can burn and with oxygen sandwiched in between all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition the company said. Tests at SpaceX?s facilities in Hawthorne Calif. and McGregor Tex. supported that conclusion the company said. The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer SpaceX said. The next SpaceX launch is to carry a   of satellites for Iridium Communications which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites each about the size of a Mini Cooper car. A month ago Iridium issued a statement saying it hoped that SpaceX would be able to launch its satellites in   but less than a week later SpaceX said it was pushing back the launch date to early January. The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. For launches from Florida SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center once used for space shuttle launches. SpaceX is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station this month.
37,17326,A ?World Unto Itself? in New York Area Yeshivas: Floor Hockey - The New York Times,New York Times,Corey Kilgannon,3/13/2017,2017,3,,In the basement of a mammoth old building in Upper Manhattan that houses the Yeshiva University High School for Boys sits a cramped gym that is home to the high school?s floor hockey team known as the Lions. The school calls the gym the Lions? Den but many visitors call it the Dungeon and liken playing there to playing hockey inside a box. Games are raucous affairs with rough play and frenzied fans squeezed onto the narrow bleachers at one end between the squads of panting players. Several miles away in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx is the comparatively luxurious indoor rink at the Salanter Akiba Riverdale High School known as S. A. R. With its sturdy boards and rounded sides the rink resembles a real ice hockey surface. Its scoreboard is flanked by American and Israeli flags. Between these two extremes exists the   but thriving world of interscholastic floor hockey at yeshiva high schools in New York City and surrounding towns. The game in these Orthodox Jewish private schools stretches back at least to the late 1970s but in recent years it has grown enormously popular. The championship match can fill an arena with as many as 1 000 fans with more people watching live online. Players in elementary grades at Jewish schools now set their sights on yeshivas with the most powerful hockey programs. ?Outside the Orthodox community this is a foreign thing? said Amir Gavarin 22 a former floor hockey league player. ?But inside it?s a whole world unto itself and supercompetitive. ? The teams play in the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Hockey League which includes 18 varsity and 15 junior varsity teams for boys. There are also 12 girls? teams which play in the spring season. The game is similar to ice hockey but played on foot on a gym floor with a hard orange ball and   squads made up of a goalie and four roaming players. Goalies wear full padding but the other players wear sweatpants jerseys and helmets with face masks. Under the jersey some players wear a tallit katan a religious garment with knotted fringes or zizit. Blatant body checking is banned but there is plenty of contact. The teams play mostly in conventional gyms set up with temporary barriers. Orthodox youngsters are often introduced to the game in summer camp or by friends from their synagogue and end up playing in one of the many youth leagues that have cropped up in Orthodox neighborhoods before joining teams in middle school. ?In some New Jersey yeshivas floor hockey is more popular than basketball? said Yoni Stone the varsity coach at the Yeshiva University High School for Boys. ?Forget high school  ?   every single day school has a team and the kids start in the youth leagues. ? Players abiding by their religious tenets use the sport as an outlet between long hours spent studying Judaic texts and other subjects. Since they observe the Sabbath there is no play on Friday evenings or Saturdays before sundown. The season runs from late October through March. On a weeknight last month the Lions made their dramatic pregame entrance to blaring rock music. They were there to take on the Cobras from the Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School in Livingston N. J. a school financed by the family of Jared Kushner the    of   Donald J. Trump. Mr. Kushner himself was proficient at the sport having played for the Frisch School in Paramus N. J. when he was a teenager. The Cobras wound up beating the Lions a fatiguing feat since the ball rarely escapes the playing area making for almost nonstop action. Each game has three periods with each period lasting 12 minutes. In fact the team from the Ramaz School on Manhattan?s Upper East Side prepared to play at the Lions? gym by having one of its players a senior training to enter the Israeli Army put his teammates through rigorous military exercises. The Ramaz School holds games in a modern brightly lit gym that is a far cry from the Lions? Den. One night last month the Rams of Ramaz took on the visiting Thunder from the Rav Teitz Mesivta Academy or R. T. M. A. from Elizabeth N. J. and won the game in   overtime prompting a celebratory mob of Ramaz players. At certain powerhouses hockey is perhaps the most prominent sport and rivalries have developed between neighboring yeshivas. In Brooklyn the games can be particularly intense whenever the Magen David Yeshivah or the Yeshivah of Flatbush both in Midwood or the Yeshivat Darche Eres in Sheepshead Bay face off. ?They?re seeing all these kids in synagogue the next day so that creates a certain competitiveness? Mr. Stone said. When rivals in the Five Towns section of Long Island play ?the whole town shuts down? for games that can attract hundreds of spectators said David Kolb a hockey writer for MSG Networks and the operator of Camp Dovid a summer hockey camp in Pennsylvania where campers wear the names of their yeshivas on their jerseys. Two top teams in the Five Towns  ?   the Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway and the D. R. S. Yeshiva High School for Boys  ?   have nurtured a   rivalry. And in the league final in 2014 when the Hebrew Academy finally avenged years of losses with a victory ?you would have thought the messiah had come? said Seth Gordon the hockey commissioner for the Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League. ?Some of these rivalries start in elementary school with the seeds planted when these kids are in sixth grade? Mr. Gordon said. Though the sport has drawn a loyal and passionate following the athletes are ultimately religious students who are urged to put their spiritual priorities before their athletic ones. ?It?s common with the Jewish identity that we can?t do certain things because of the boundaries of observant Jewish life so we create our own parameters and do it to the fullest? Mr. Gavarin said. Mayer Schiller a Hasidic rabbi who in the 1990s coached Yeshiva University High School to six consecutive league championships is recognized as the progenitor of the yeshiva floor hockey scene. He was hard to miss since he coached wearing his black hat and coat. Rabbi Schiller 65 still an avid fan of rock pop and punk music established the now popular tradition of having players enter the gym to loud music. The rabbi?s choice: the Ramones. He grew up playing roller hockey in Queens. In the late 1970s with New York?s professional basketball teams sagging students began rooting for two local hockey teams the Rangers and the Islanders Rabbi Schiller recalled. Rabbi Schiller was a devout Rangers fan who was particularly fond of the raucous play of Nick Fotiu a native of Staten Island who became a brawler for the Rangers. The rabbi formed a team at the Ramaz School in 1979 and helped organize a fledgling yeshiva hockey league with a   teams that grew significantly over the years. He regarded coaching as a form of spiritual service and striving at sports as a complement to studying sacred texts and worshiping God. ?If God didn?t mean for this greatness to exist why did he give us Gretzky and Jordan?? Rabbi Schiller said. On a recent weeknight the S. A. R. team  ?   which includes Mr. Kolb?s two sons Gordie and Henri  ?   was put through   drills and scrimmaging by its longtime head coach Howie Falkenstein. Mr. Falkenstein also runs a hockey program at the Westchester Summer Day camp in Mamaroneck N. Y. and a league in the Bronx that attracts players from across the region. Its youngest level is the Mites division which is open to first and second graders. Mr. Falkenstein was getting his team ready for its game against the Frisch School and had players practicing penalty shots. Gordie the S. A. R. Sting?s captain deftly scored on his brother a goalie prompting a chorus of hoots from teammates. S. A. R. wound up beating Frisch solidifying its status as one of the league?s top teams. ?It?s definitely its own niche but it?s still hockey and it has the team camaraderie that people are looking for? Mr. Falkenstein said. ?It has the same excitement when you score a goal or make a save. ?
38,17327,Inside Jonathan Lethem?s Oddball Trove - The New York Times,New York Times,Jennifer Schuessler,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Writers are different from the rest of us. Their castoff scraps can be worth money not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars. Jonathan Lethem 52 recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive. The Beinecke Rare Book  Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired a trove of his manuscripts letters notes and other artifacts which will now sit alongside material from Walt Whitman Sinclair Lewis James Baldwin and Marilynne Robinson in its rich American literature collection. Mr. Lethem?s papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of Brooklyn?s literary ascendance including ?Motherless Brooklyn? (1999) and ?The Fortress of Solitude? (2003). But as befits a lifelong collector music obsessive comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture there are also   cartoons New York 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection. ?For an author who is so much fun as a novelist it?s interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well? said Melissa Barton the curator of American prose and drama at the Beinecke. (Ms. Barton citing library policy declined to say what Yale paid in the sale which was arranged by the Manhattan book dealer Glenn Horowitz.) Mr. Lethem?s archive also includes two computer hard drives a laptop and other digital materials especially from more recent years. ?You can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera? Mr. Lethem whose most recent novel ?A Gambler?s Anatomy? appeared in October said in an interview. But the bulk of the collection consists of   artifacts some of them charmingly weird. We asked Mr. Lethem who left New York in 2010 to teach creative writing at Pomona College in Claremont Calif. about some of the odder items in his literary closet. The archive includes a number of   comic books Mr. Lethem made as a child featuring invented superheroes like   Man whose origin story included an   attempt to start a nudist colony in Alaska. In one installment   Man (who later got a passing   in ?The Fortress of Solitude?) battled Ed Koch who was no hero to Mr. Lethem?s   bohemian parents. ?I didn?t make multiple copies to sell or anything? he said. ?It was more like I was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where   Man was a real comic. ? Mr. Lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie ?The Warriors? in the   subway station in Brooklyn which was standing in for the Times Square station. ?This was my subway stop and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd Street seemed absurd? Mr. Lethem recalled. ?I remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie. Nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important. ? The archive contains typescripts of his novels often affixed with alternate titles. (Would ?Motherless Brooklyn? have been a hit if it had been called ?Jerks From Nowhere??) The earliest is ?Apes in the Plan? an unpublished ?fake Philip K. Dick novel? as Mr. Lethem put it named for a Devo lyric and written between ages 18 and 23. ?I wrote three novels on an electric typewriter? he said. ?If I live long enough I could end up being one of the last living humans who can say that. ? This diary tracking his writing progress social interactions exercise and um digestion comes from the   when Mr. Lethem had dropped out of Bennington College and moved to Berkeley Calif. to try to become a writer. ?I had thrust myself into a kind of vacuum? he said. ?I had no visible means of support nor was anyone expecting to hear from me. This kind of weird   probably had to do with externalizing my superego and answering the question ?Who are you and what did you actually do today? ?? About those drawings of vomiting cats   ?     ?For about 15 years every time I had a really good dance party that went late with people lolling around drunk and exhausted at about 2 a. m. I would hand out paper and ask everyone to draw a vomiting cat? Mr. Lethem said. ?I ended up with an incredibly thick file of drawings some by people who went on to be published cartoonists and writers. ? Some of the goofy character names in Mr. Lethem?s novels are drawn from   lists he typed up early in his career a habit he connects with the wordplay of ?Motherless Brooklyn? whose narrator has Tourette?s syndrome. Mr. Lethem recalled a moment of recognition sparked by an Oliver Sacks essay about a surgeon with Tourette?s who kept a list of more than 200 unusual names as ?candy for the mind. ? ?He was collecting real names? Mr. Lethem said. ?But when I read that I thought ?Oh my God that?s me. ?? Names from this list showed up in ?Gun With Occasional Music? (1994) and ?Chronic City? (2009). ?The Fortress of Solitude? inspired by Mr. Lethem?s Brooklyn childhood describes a   store called Samuel J. Underberg ?a site of mysterious life? where graffiti artists came to buy ink that was specially formulated for stamping prices on slimy packages of meat and therefore ideal for tagging. While writing Mr. Lethem acquired some random items from the real Underberg?s (now demolished) which are shown here with a 1978 Billboard Hot 100 list an old calendar and other research materials. ?I became a collector of all this tawdry used signage? he said. ?I just thought it was really weird and cool. ? The archive contains dozens of letters from fellow writers and artists including Donna Tartt Paul Auster Suzanne Vega Jennifer Egan Thomas Berger and Ursula K. Le Guin. This missive written on an airline safety card is from the novelist David Bowman who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2012. ?All his letters were like mail art? Mr. Lethem said. ?David had a great crazy brain. He never stopped covering the world in language. ?
39,17328,An Immigrant?s Instinct to Aid Others Collides With Financial Need - The New York Times,New York Times,John Otis,1/2/2017,2017,1,,In 2007 Rey Canunayon and his wife MaryGwen immigrated to the United States from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. In doing so they were fulfilling their family?s dreams. For years her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City. But her parents died before that could happen. Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive. Still he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move. ?America is a great nation a kind nation a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities? Mr. Canunayon said. When the couple arrived they stayed with Ms. Canunayon?s family in New Jersey. Life was exciting even relaxing Mr. Canunayon said. But as they settled in a new country he struggled to find work and grew despondent. ?Oh my God I have cried a river because I was in a depression? said Mr. Canunayon now 46. He found relaxation riding the subway one station to the next so long as it kept moving. ?When you come from a place where you are so familiar your own country you have friends relatives connections a career. And then you?re stripped of everything except your dignity it?s really hard? he said. Eventually the couple were able to move into an apartment of their own in Elmhurst Queens. They also secured employment. He works at a   laundry while his wife 49 is a babysitter a midwife and a nanny. In October 2015 they received their green cards. Beyond that Mr. Canunayon who left a career in nonprofit work in the Philippines has recommitted himself to working to help people and neighborhoods change for the better. Only this time he is not collecting a paycheck for it. ?God gave knowledge for free skills for free talent for free so I?ll give it for free? Mr. Canunayon said. He volunteers at the couple?s place of worship in Elmhurst St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church. He also helps other Filipino immigrants. ?I cannot imagine myself not sharing the skills and   talent that I have? he said. But because this effort doesn?t come with a salary it doesn?t help pay the bills. It took one episode when the Canunayons received a $600 medical bill for lab tests in September for them to plummet into financial instability. ?It was a big problem Mr. Canunayon said. ?What will happen to us if we can?t pay the rent?? He came across a possible solution on one of his volunteer outings for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Filipino Consulate where he was helping people renew their passports. He mentioned his financial problems to Greg Hankins a volunteer he had met that day. Mr. Hankins encouraged him to contact another group Community Health Advocates. It is operated by the Community Service Society one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society did help providing $641. 45 in Neediest Cases money to cover the couple?s outstanding medical bills. They also got help obtaining health insurance. While grateful for the assistance they continue to worry about everyday challenges: making ends meet sending money back to their families and carefully monitoring their finances. ?It?s the same situation financially struggling and trying to get myself back into the saddle? Mr. Canunayon said. He continues to search for jobs in the nonprofit sector. In the Philippines he worked in research advocacy and policy legislation which led to the development of sustainable organic agriculture to feed the poor. The cause was personal: Many members of his family are farmers. He has not given up hope that he will find a job that lets him continue his passion for service while providing a decent income. ?I would be killing myself if I did something else? he said. ?It would deplete my energy. When you work on the things you most love doing it?s not work. ?
40,17330,House Republicans Under Fire Back Down on Gutting Ethics Office - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lipton and Matt Flegenheimer,1/4/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   It was supposed to be a triumphant morning for Republicans on Capitol Hill  ?   a moment to demonstrate the merits of unified party rule in the age of Donald J. Trump. By noon party leaders had a message for their charges: It was not going smoothly. The day after House Republicans voted to eliminate an independent ethics body members returned to work on Tuesday to find their offices inundated with angry missives from constituents amid a national uproar. By midmorning Mr. Trump had weighed in questioning the members? priorities on Twitter. Shortly after lawmakers were summoned to the basement of the Capitol for a hastily convened meeting with Republican leaders. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California the majority leader  ?   who along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan had opposed the proposal  ?   lobbed a pointed question at his fellow Republicans according to two people present: Had they campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act or tinkering with an ethics office? Minutes later members emerged to say the changes had been scrapped. The reversal came less than 24 hours after House Republicans meeting in a secret session voted to curtail the powers of the Office of Congressional Ethics an independent body created in 2008 after a series of scandals involving House lawmakers including three who were sent to jail. It was part of a turbulent opening for the Trump era in Washington marked by a Republican push in the Senate to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans led by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia had sought on Monday to prevent the office from pursuing investigations that might result in criminal charges. Instead they wanted to allow lawmakers on the more powerful House Ethics Committee to shut down inquiries. They even sought to block the small staff at the Office of Congressional Ethics which would have been renamed and put under the oversight of House lawmakers from speaking to the news media. ?It has damaged or destroyed a lot of political careers in this place and it?s cost members of Congress millions of dollars to defend themselves against anonymous allegations? Representative Steve King Republican of Iowa said Tuesday still defending the move. But such resolve crumbled Tuesday morning as thousands of phone calls flooded lawmakers? offices and both conservative and liberal ethics groups issued statements condemning the vote. Some Republicans joined in saying the measure sent the wrong message to the public. (Internet searches for the words ?Who is my representative? surged after news of the plan broke Monday night and peaked Tuesday morning according to Google.) ?It was a stumble? said Representative Mark Sanford Republican of South Carolina who opposed the measure and who was himself the subject of an ethics investigation while he was governor of South Carolina. ?Probably not the way you want to start out. ? Mr. Trump had weighed in via a series of Twitter posts suggesting that the House should be focused on domestic policy priorities such as health care and a tax overhaul. He called the Office of Congressional Ethics ?unfair? but said focusing on it now was a case of misplaced priorities. He appended the hashtag ?DTS? an apparent allusion to his promise to ?drain the swamp? in Washington. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy had made clear on Monday that they too were opposed to the change. But amid boxes of pizza at a House office building with the Rose Bowl playing on a nearby television several members voiced support for the maneuver including Representative Steve Pearce of New Mexico whose office employed an aide who was ensnared in an ethics inquiry but later cleared. At first on Tuesday morning Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy played down the changes. Mr. McCarthy suggested that he and Mr. Ryan did not have the power to simply order other Republicans to take their advice. ?Welcome back? he joked referring to the start of the new session of Congress on Tuesday. Even at home he said ?I usually don?t win what we watch on TV. ? About an hour later before new members of Congress were to be sworn in  ?   the point when the House adopts new rules that will govern how it conducts itself during the   session  ?   Mr. McCarthy told his fellow Republicans that they needed to reverse themselves quickly or potentially face an even more embarrassing revolt on the House floor. By his estimation he told them the provision was going to be removed one way or another. This was not the first time that House lawmakers  ?   Democrats or Republicans  ?   had tried to curtail the powers or budget of the Office of Congressional Ethics which some lawmakers see as being too aggressive in its investigations even though it is routinely cheered by nonprofit ethics groups on both the left and the right. Perhaps most prominently in 2011 Representative Melvin Watt a North Carolina Democrat who later left Congress to join the Obama administration tried to cut the agency?s budget by 40 percent a proposal that failed on a   vote. The House Ethics Committee the only body that has the power to actually punish lawmakers also frequently clashed with the office which serves more as a grand jury that investigates allegations and issues findings to the Ethics Committee of probable cause of misdeeds. For example the committee tried in 2015 to force the Office of Congressional Ethics to shut down its investigation into allegations that nine House lawmakers? trips to Azerbaijan in 2013 had been improperly paid for in part by a foreign government entity. Some of the lawmakers also accepted improper gifts during the trips including rugs and crystal. The Office of Congressional Ethics refused to shut down its inquiry and it published its findings on its own after the Ethics Committee voted to clear the lawmakers of wrongdoing (although the committee urged them to return the gifts). House rules require the Ethics Committee to act on recommendations by the Office of Congressional Ethics within 90 days with the expectation that it will either formally clear the targeted lawmakers or create investigative committees to determine if rules or laws have been violated. But in recent years the committee has increasingly relied on a loophole that allows it to informally continue to review allegations without closing a case a step it has taken in 21 of the 68 cases referred since 2009. Most frequently that means an end to the matter at least as far as the public is aware even though the Ethics Committee never formally announces that it has closed the investigation. As of this week cases in such a limbo include allegations against Representatives Mark Meadows Republican of North Carolina Roger Williams Republican of Texas Markwayne Mullin Republican of Oklahoma Cathy McMorris Rodgers Republican of Washington Bobby L. Rush Democrat of Illinois and Luis V. Gutirrez Democrat of Illinois. After their reversal on Tuesday House Republicans agreed to ask the Ethics Committee to examine the Office of Congressional Ethics and recommend possible changes by this summer to address the concerns that some members have raised. Mr. Goodlatte who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee defended his proposal and called the reporting about it inaccurate. ?Gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment and the media willing to go along with this agenda resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment? he said in a statement. But Mr. Goodlatte?s critics said he had simply been caught trying to sneak through a favor to help protect his fellow lawmakers. ?We?re glad that the House Republicans listened to the public outrage about this proposal and came to their senses to reverse it and not end real ethics enforcement in Congress? Noah Bookbinder executive director of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said.
41,17331,Republican Party Megyn Kelly Titanic: Your Wednesday Briefing - The New York Times,New York Times,Sean Alfano,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (Want to get this briefing by email? Here?s the  .) Good morning. Here?s what you need to know: ? Congress focuses on health care. Debate begins today on legislation to dismantle major parts of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama is scheduled to meet with Democrats about resisting efforts to repeal the law while Vice   Mike Pence will meet with lawmakers from his party to gird them for a fight. ? Rough first day back. Republican lawmakers abandoned on Monday a move to eliminate an ethics office after rebukes from constituents and from   Donald J. Trump. Our writer says Mr. Trump?s intervention raises ?alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. ? ? Trump on trade. The  ?s pick for trade representative Robert Lighthizer is a longtime advocate of protectionist policies a choice in line with Mr. Trump?s focus on making products in America. That effort has made some Republicans uneasy but some Democrats are ready to support it. Earlier on Tuesday Mr. Trump criticized General Motors for making cars in Mexico. Hours later Ford said it would expand production at a Michigan factory and would drop plans for a new plant in Mexico. ? Getting ready for legal fights.  Democratic leaders of the California Legislature have hired the former U. S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to represent them in any legal fights against the White House. The state is preparing for battles on issues including the environment immigration and criminal justice. ? Latest in Istanbul attack. Turkish officials say they know who killed at least 39 people in an assault on a nightclub last weekend although they did not release his name. A video appears to show the suspect recording himself as he walked through the city. ? Challenges ahead for Netanyahu. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has been ?the ultimate survivor? in a political system that destroyed many of his predecessors our writers say but the current graft inquiry could be different. The political turmoil comes as an Israeli soldier was found guilty of manslaughter today for shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker. The country has been highly divided over the case. ? Rethinking death. One of our most popular stories this week is about Dr. B. J. Miller who became a triple amputee after a horrific accident in college. He?s on a quest to change the way we die and he pioneered a model of palliative care that aims to view death as a human experience not just a medical one. ? Megyn Kelly?s move to NBC from Fox News heralds a major shift in the cable news landscape and it will give her a daytime show as well as a Sunday newsmagazine. Some industry executives outlined the challenges Ms. Kelly will face in those formats. ? India has become a major center for cyberfraud as a result of an abundance of young workers skilled in computers and English. A recent scheme targeting Indian immigrants in the U. S. came to light when two teenage workers blew the whistle. ? The price of Bitcoin is soaring thanks in part to a tilt toward isolationism in the U. S. and Europe and to trading by Chinese speculators. The virtual currency is worth about $1 025 or 140 percent more than a year ago. ? U. S. stocks were up on Tuesday. Here?s a snapshot of global markets. ? Welcome to Hell   ?     Hell Mich. Our 360 video follows John Colone the unofficial mayor of the town which has a population of 72. ? New to read.

Louisa Adams the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825 to 1829) was the first. She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors including the future president who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797. Louisa arrived in the U. S. in 1801 when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas and her soirees were the heart of Washington?s social life when her husband was secretary of state proving to be crucial to his ascension to the presidency. The question of her ?Americanness? became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to defend herself only drew more attention to her background. Louisa continued to be a political partner to her husband as he served in Congress after leaving the White House supporting his antislavery efforts. When she died in 1852 both Houses adjourned.

42,17332,Turmoil Overshadows First Day of Republican-Controlled Congress - The New York Times,New York Times,Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear,1/4/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   The   Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President Obama?s signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an   attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office. On a day usually reserved for pomp constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles. Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won   but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from   Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities. It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House. There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump who ran against the Republican establishment would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times. As Democrats in both chambers seethed Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the majority leader unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring even if any replacement of the law could take years. Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law. Under arcane budget procedures that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority. And debate will begin on Wednesday before senators have even moved into their new offices. The dueling over the health law?s fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well. On Wednesday Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal and Mike Pence the vice   will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead. While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises the House got off to a messy start brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. Ryan?s wishes. That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls. ?Every   organization is calling my office? said Representative Pete Sessions Republican of Texas. ?And we?ve told them: ?Thank you very much. We appreciate your feedback. ?? After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote. As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters the House kerfuffle seemed to cast a shadow over Mr. Ryan but he tried to brush it off. ?There?s no sense of foreboding in the House today? Mr. Ryan said after his   ?only the sense of potential. ? The fight over the House rules was already acrimonious thanks to a piece of the package that would impose $2 500 in fines for filming events on the House floor a response to Democrats who streamed their overnight   over guns last June using cellphones and video cameras. In the Senate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. swore in seven new members and all the incumbents who won their races last year their colleagues looking on cheerfully as a cold rain pelted the newly refurbished Capitol dome. Members of the House and Senate brought along their families  ?   elderly parents with canes small children tugging at uncomfortable lacy hems  ?   as well as former senators and other special guests. Former Vice President Dick Cheney accompanied his daughter Liz to her   as a member of the House elected from Wyoming. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York officially became the Democratic leader and quickly warned Republicans that the minority would be vocal if not operatic in resisting much of their agenda and many of Mr. Trump?s nominees. ?It is our job to do what?s best for the American people the middle class and those struggling to get there? he said. ?If the   proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure trade and closing the carried interest loophole for instance we will work in good faith to perfect and potentially enact it. When he doesn?t we will resist. ? He added ?If   Trump lets the   members of Congress and his cabinet run the show if he adopts their timeworn policies  ?   which benefit the elites the special interests and corporate America not the working man and woman  ?   his presidency will not succeed. ? On Tuesday the House also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law. The budget blueprint introduced on Tuesday in the Senate is not sent to the president and does not become law but still clears the way for subsequent legislation that Republicans say will repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans bypassed the Budget Committee so they could immediately bring the measure to the floor. Such resolutions are normally developed after weeks of work in the Budget Committee. Under the plan four congressional committees  ?   two in the House and two in the Senate  ?   have until Jan. 27 to develop legislation that will be the vehicle for repealing the health care law. The document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved. Nor does it specify or even suggest how Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act which the Obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured. Republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for Republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law. The budget blueprint allows Republicans to use savings from repealing major provisions of that law to help offset the cost of future unspecified measures to help people obtain coverage. ?Americans face skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles? said Senator Mike Enzi Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ?Insurers are withdrawing from markets across the country leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before  ?   the opposite of what the law promised. ? The American Medical Association urged Congress on Tuesday to explain how it would replace the Affordable Care Act. ?Before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage policy makers should lay out for the American people in reasonable detail what will replace current policies? the chief executive of the association Dr. James L. Madara said in a letter to congressional leaders. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California who engineered the House passage of the health law in 2010 promised this week that Democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal. Republicans have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several years. Ms. Pelosi said that such a delay would be ?an act of cowardice on the part of Republicans? and that ?they don?t even have the votes to do it? because they have not agreed on a replacement plan. Democrats also vowed to give Mr. Trump?s cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California the   Democrat on the Judiciary Committee has written to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa the committee chairman asking to postpone the first scheduled confirmation hearing set for next week for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama whom Mr. Trump has chosen as attorney general.
43,17333,With Choice of Trade Negotiator Trump Prepares to Confront Mexico and China - The New York Times,New York Times,Binyamin Appelbaum,1/4/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?     Donald J. Trump on Tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a Washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies the latest sign that Mr. Trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with China Mexico and other trading partners. Mr. Trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade American companies to expand domestic manufacturing criticizing General Motors via Twitter on Tuesday morning for making in Mexico some of the Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. Hours later Mr. Trump claimed credit after Ford said it would expand vehicle production in Flat Rock Mich. The choice of Robert Lighthizer (pronounced   ) to be the United States? trade representative nearly completes Mr. Trump?s selection of top economic advisers and taken together with the  ?s running commentary on Twitter underscores Mr. Trump?s focus on making things in America. That is causing unease among some Republicans who regard Mr. Trump?s views on trade as dangerously retrograde even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda. Mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth. But some Democrats are signaling a readiness to support Mr. Trump. Nine House Democrats held a news conference Tuesday with the A. F. L. . I. O. president Richard Trumka to urge renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. ?We wanted him to know that we?ll work with him on doing that? Mr. Trumka said. ?I don?t think he has enough Republican support to do it and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people. ? Mr. Trump and his top advisers on trade including Mr. Lighthizer share a view that the United States in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own  . They argue that other countries are undermining America?s industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding American importers. They regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy. In picking Mr. Lighthizer who has spent much of the last few decades representing American steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes Mr. Trump is seeking to hire one of Washington?s top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. He must be confirmed by the Senate. ?He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity? Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mainstream Republicans have sought common ground with Mr. Trump emphasizing for example the importance of enforcing trade rules but they have not abandoned the party?s longtime advocacy for trade. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee which will hold hearings on Mr. Lighthizer?s nomination issued a cautiously supportive statement Tuesday. ?As the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints we can?t afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for   products and services? Mr. Hatch said in a statement. ?I look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob?s trade philosophy and priorities. ? Mr. Trump has named a number of advisers on trade leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. The   named the economist Peter Navarro an outspoken critic of China to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. Mr. Trump also said Wilbur Ross the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary will play a key role. Mr. Lighthizer however is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience. ?Those who say U. S. T. R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken? said Alan Wolff another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry?s   on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years citing Mr. Lighthizer?s encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. ?He?ll be a dominant figure on trade in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro. ? There is also an ideological divide between the people Mr. Trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like Gary D. Cohn the president of Goldman Sachs who will lead the National Economic Council Rex W. Tillerson the chief executive of Exxon Mobil tapped for secretary of state and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa Mr. Trump?s choice for ambassador to China. Proponents of trade hope the broader circle and congressional Republicans will exert a moderating influence. ?You?re seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law? said Scott Lincicome an international trade lawyer at White  Case. ?But that doesn?t necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement. ? Trade opponents on the left and the right meanwhile are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of   policy. ?There?s going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade and we?re hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker? Mr. Trumka said. Mr. Trump?s promise to immediately designate China as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration?s intentions. Economists see no evidence China is suppressing the value of its currency although it has done so in the past. Mr. Lincicome said officially labeling China a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues. A broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. Mr. Trump has promised to renegotiate Nafta the original process took most of three years. He has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations but it takes time to mount cases. He has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation. Mr. Trump already is seeking to exert influence by seizing the presidential bullhorn. ?General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U. S. car   free across border? he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. ?Make in U. S. A. or pay big border tax!? General Motors announced in 2015 that it would make the Cruze in Coahuila Mexico. American manufacturers are moving   production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. They continue to build more expensive vehicles in the United States. Ford?s announcement Tuesday does not reverse that trend. The carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But it said it would invest in a different Michigan plant to expand production of   vehicles including its   pickup truck and the Mustang sports car as well as a new   sport utility vehicle. ?We are encouraged by the   policies that   Trump and the new Congress have indicated they will pursue? said the company?s chief executive Mark Fields. Mr. Lighthizer served as deputy United States trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration when he was involved in pressing Japan to reduce its restrictions on American imports and its subsidies for its own exports. Mr. Trump has criticized China for similar practices setting the stage for a new round of confrontations. Reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on Japanese auto imports. It was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded like China in recent years as a threat to American prosperity. ?President Reagan?s pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders? Mr. Lighthizer wrote in a 2008 piece criticizing Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona for embracing ?unbridled? free trade. Conservatives he argued ?always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class. ?
44,17334,Trump Appears to Side With Assange Over Intelligence Agencies? Conclusions - The New York Times,New York Times,Scott Shane Maggie Haberman and Julie Hirschfeld Davis,1/5/2017,2017,1,,?   Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies with Vice   Mike Pence backing him up. ? She?s hired: Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post as do some notable Trump loyalists. But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office?s top slots. ? The   finds something ?very strange? about his intelligence briefing on Friday  ?   even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday. For the Republican Party Mr. Assange the WikiLeaks founder was once purely a villain. He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London fleeing charges of rape. But now Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America?s intelligence services. Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity one of Mr. Trump?s biggest news media boosters to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton?s campaign chairman John Podesta. Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released most likely by Thursday. There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence  ?   with ?100 percent? certainty. As he has previously Mr. Assange said: ?Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties. ? But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that in addition to WikiLeaks the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites DCLeaks. com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2. 0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange?s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that ?terrible? information mentioned by Mr. Trump the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint Mich. tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city?s   water supply. That was in fact reported widely and often here and here and here and here among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query  ?   for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. The   appears to be getting a jump on the news. Vice   Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump?s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday effectively doubling down on the incoming administration?s icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump ?expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions? Mr. Pence said with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump?s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the   saying he would not be commenting on ?every little tweet or Facebook post. ? But he called Mr. Assange ?a sycophant for Russia? who ?leaks steals data and compromises national security. ? Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. ?Hopefully he?ll get up to speed on what?s been happening and what Russia has or has not done? he said. Ms. Manigault the villain and diva from Mr. Trump?s reality television show ?The Apprentice? was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the ?Bridgegate? scandal who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller who was head of private security at Mr. Trump?s real estate company will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos who organized those giant campaign rallies will be director of advance a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. Ms. Manigault aside Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan George Bush and George W. Bush as his deputy chief of staff for operations a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security among other things. He named Rick Dearborn who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill as his chief liaison to Congress heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus Mr. Trump?s incoming chief of staff will become his deputy at the White House overseeing senior staff scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement Mr. Priebus called the three a ?team of doers? who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway who served as counselor to Mr. Trump said she was thrilled to have ?another strong female leader? on the team in Ms. Walsh. First Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then on New Year?s Eve the   promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. And now he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight. The Obama administration quickly let it be known that in fact intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused. Nor were some Republican political consultants. But this is not the first time the   has taken a swipe at the intelligence community which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president. President Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement the Affordable Care Act. Vice   Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans. ?The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare? Mr. Pence said. ?It needs to be done. ? And Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with   health problems. ?Schumer clowns? may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the new minority leader but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care. ?Republicans should stop clowning around with Americans? Medicare Medicaid and health care? Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would ?throw the entire health care system into chaos. ? Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the House minority leader tried to coin a phrase: ?Make America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?? The Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27 when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that ?many people? saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino Calif. attackers? home and failed to report it. That long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm. He did after all win the election. But he says he will hold a true open news conference next Wednesday. No word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month then canceled to specifically reveal his plans for the future of his corporation.
45,17335,California Hires Eric Holder as Legal Bulwark Against Donald Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Adam Nagourney,1/5/2017,2017,1,,LOS ANGELES  ?   Girding for four years of potential battles with   Donald J. Trump Democratic leaders of the California Legislature announced Wednesday that they had hired Eric H. Holder Jr. who was attorney general under President Obama to represent them in any legal fights against the new Republican White House. The decision by the Legislature to retain Mr. Holder who is now a prominent Washington lawyer is the latest sign of  the ideological battle that may play out over the next four years between this predominantly Democratic state and Washington. Hillary Clinton the Democratic candidate for president defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes here. ?Having the former attorney general of the United States brings us a lot of firepower in order to prepare to safeguard the values of the people of California? Kevin de Len the Democratic leader of the Senate said in an interview. ?This means we are very very serious. ? Mr. de Len said he expected California to challenge Washington  ?   and defend itself from policies instituted in Washington  ?   on issues including the environment immigration and criminal justice. He said California Democrats decided to turn to Mr. Holder as they watched Mr. Trump assemble his cabinet and begin to set the tone for his presidency. ?It was very clear that it wasn?t just campaign rhetoric? Mr. de Len said of Mr. Trump?s proposals over the past year. ?He was surrounding himself with people who are a very clear and present danger to the economic prosperity of California. ? Mr. Trump did not immediately return requests for comment. The move by Mr. de Len and his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly Anthony Rendon follows Gov. Jerry Brown?s appointment of Representative Xavier Becerra as attorney general last month to succeed Kamala D. Harris who was elected to the United States Senate. That appointment made Mr. Becerra one of the   Latino officials in this state and he is expected to be instrumental in battling with the Trump White House over any attempt to enforce stringent measures aimed at immigrants. Mr. Brown has made clear that he intends to challenge the administration on global warming and that his attorney general will be a key to that battle. The Democratic Party controls   of both the Assembly and the Senate in California. Every statewide elected official is a Democrat. Mr. Holder was Mr. Obama?s attorney general from 2009 to 2015. He was the first   to hold that position. He is a partner at Covington  Burling a law firm in Washington that specializes in representing states and companies against the federal government. ?I am honored that the Legislature chose Covington to serve as its legal adviser as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California?s residents and policy priorities? Mr. Holder said in a statement. ?I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the Legislature. ? The Legislature has an ample stable of lawyers on staff but officials said Mr. Holder and his firm brought specific litigation and political skills that could be needed in the coming years. Mr. de Len said the final compensation for the firm had not been set but would be publicly disclosed once it was. ?The cost will be very minimal compared to the billions of dollars at stake if California doesn?t adequately make its case? he said.
46,17336,Israeli Soldier Who Shot Wounded Palestinian Assailant Is Convicted - The New York Times,New York Times,Isabel Kershner,1/5/2017,2017,1,,JERUSALEM  ?   The fate of just one   Israeli soldier was hanging in the balance. But for many Israelis the guilty verdict announced on Wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state. When the military judges convicted Sgt. Elor Azaria of manslaughter for shooting a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised. Since the shooting in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March the case has polarized Israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands. With the 50th anniversary of Israel?s occupation of the West Bank approaching the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in Israeli society. The verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed: Hours after it was rendered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned. ?This is a difficult and painful day for us all? Mr. Netanyahu said in a Facebook post supporting a pardon which can be granted by Israel?s president or the army?s top officials. Referring to the Israel Defense Forces he added ?The soldiers of the I. D. F. are our sons and daughters and they need to remain above any dispute. ? Prof. David Enoch an expert in the philosophy of law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said he thought the manslaughter conviction was ?justified? but added ?I?m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public. ? The military?s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated but that once the threat is neutralized they should not be killed. Rights groups and other critics have accused Israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings shootings and car attacks by Palestinians. The Hebron killing caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force and even military leaders said Sergeant Azaria acted without justification. But in Israel a country where military service is a part of national identity many Jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that Sergeant Azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal since that would have put his commanders in a bad light. Israel?s defense minister Avigdor Lieberman called Wednesday?s decision ?a tough verdict. ? ?The first thing I ask of all of us  ?   those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less  ?   we are all obligated to respect the court?s decision? Mr. Lieberman said. ?We are obligated to maintain restraint. ? Mr. Lieberman as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment had attended the military court to support Sergeant Azaria and called the legal proceedings a ?theater of the absurd. ? But on Wednesday he said ?We must keep the army above and beyond all political argument. ? Politicians to Mr. Netanyahu?s right and left have also called for a pardon including the education minister Naftali Bennett and Shelly Yacimovich of the Labor Party who said that ?Azaria?s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure? the case has exposed. Some Israeli experts compared the Azaria verdict to the Kafr Qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago after border police officers fatally shot 49 Arab men women and children as they returned from work in the fields unwittingly breaking a curfew. The murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a ?patently illegal order? that carries a ?black flag? of criminality. It helped shape the army?s ethos. Now some fear that in the lower ranks it has begun to erode. In a measure of the tensions the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military?s headquarters in Tel Aviv rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held to keep demonstrators at bay. Video footage showed Sergeant Azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause and he was embraced by his family and friends. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound shouting slogans like ?free the boy. ? Col. Maya Heller one of the military judges spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict. She systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been ?no justification? for the shooting according to reports from the courtroom. Describing Sergeant Azaria?s telling of the event as ?twisting? and ?evolving? the judge said the defense had tried to ?hold the rope at both ends. ? On one hand it asserted that the victim Abed     appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time Sergeant Azaria shot him in the head. The judge seemed to give great weight to statements Sergeant Azaria a medic who was 19 at the time made at the scene indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge. A soldier testified that before the shooting Sergeant Azaria had said ?How is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive?? After the shooting a commander who was at the scene recalled Sergeant Azaria saying ?The terrorist deserved to die. ? Ilan Katz one of Sergeant Azaria?s lawyers vowed to appeal. The military?s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct. But Israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued Palestinian attacks many   politicians and celebrities along with Jewish parents of soldiers hailed Sergeant Azaria as a hero. Mr. Netanyahu first condemned Sergeant Azaria?s actions then phoned the soldier?s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly. Local television stations frequently showed images of Sergeant Azaria?s distraught parents hugging him in court. Appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism and where most Jewish    are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service his supporters portrayed him as ?everybody?s child. ? In remarks recorded before the verdict the military?s chief of staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot tried to puncture that narrative. ?An    in the Israeli Army is not ?everybody?s child?? he said. ?He is a fighter a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him. We cannot be confused about this. ? The episode began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in Hebron. Israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other Mr. Sharif 21. Sergeant Azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later. The video showed calm had been restored. Yet 11 minutes after the initial attack he cocked his rifle and shot Mr. Sharif as he lay on the road. Lawyers representing Sergeant Azaria said he had acted to save his comrades in the belief that Mr. Sharif who was still moving might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket. But Sergeant Azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away. During the trial Sergeant Azaria?s company commander Maj. Tom Naaman said he ?did not feel any danger? from Mr. Sharif undercutting the defendant?s claims. Yusri   Mr. Sharif?s father told reporters that the verdict was ?a good step? but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing which is scheduled for Jan. 15. Ahmad Tibi an Arab member of the Israeli Parliament said on  Twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed Palestinians should have been convicted. ?Fifty years of occupation add up to much more than one Azaria? Mr. Tibi wrote.
47,17337,Work. Walk 5 Minutes. Work. - The New York Times,New York Times,Gretchen Reynolds,1/9/2017,2017,1,,Stuck at your work desk? Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention and even dull hunger pangs according to an instructive new study. The study which also found that frequent brief walking breaks were more effective at improving   than a single longer walk before work could provide the basis for a simple realistic New Year?s exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day. There is growing evidence of course that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences. Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs increasing the risk for atherosclerosis the buildup of plaques in the arteries. People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily which for many of us describes a typical workday also are at heightened risk for diabetes depression and obesity compared with people who move more often. In response researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work including standing workstations and treadmill desks. But such options are cumbersome and costly making them impractical for many work situations. Some experts have worried too that if people are physically active at the office they might subsequently become more tired grumpy distracted or hungry any of which could have an undesirable effect on work performance and   health. So for the new study which was published in November in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute and other institutions decided to test several methods of increasing movement among office workers. (The study was funded largely by Johnson  Johnson with additional support from the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center.) To start the researchers invited 30 sedentary adult office workers to a university clinic to complete a battery of health tests and questionnaires. The researchers measured their heart rates and stress hormone levels and asked them to rank on a numerical scale how energetic or tired they felt as well as how happy they were and whether they were feeling peckish or had little appetite just then. The volunteers also completed computerized games designed primarily to test their ability to concentrate and make decisions. Then on three subsequent visits to the clinic each volunteer simulated a   workday. During one visit the volunteers sat for the whole time with no interruptions except for bathroom breaks. During another they walked moderately for 30 minutes at the start of their experimental day and then sat for the next five and a half hours with no additional scheduled breaks. Finally during a third visit the volunteers sat for most of the six hours but began each hour with five minutes of moderate walking using treadmills at the clinic. At the start and end of each session the researchers drew blood to check levels of stress hormones. And periodically throughout each day they asked their volunteers to numerically rate their moods energy fatigue and appetites. The volunteers also repeated the computerized testing of their thinking skills at the close of each session. The researchers then analyzed the data. The numbers showed that on almost all measures the subjects? ratings of how they were feeling rose when they did not sit for six uninterrupted hours. They said that they felt much more energetic throughout the day if they had been active whether that activity was bunched into a single longish walk at the start of the day or distributed into multiple brief breaks. On other measures though the   walks were more potent than the concentrated   version. When the workers rose most often they reported greater happiness less fatigue and considerably less craving for food than on either of the other days. Their feelings of vigor also tended to increase throughout the day while they often had plateaued by early afternoon after walking only once in the morning. There were no differences on the scores on the cognitive tests whether they sat all day or got up and moved. Stress hormones also remained steady during each visit. These results suggest that ?even a little bit of activity spread throughout the day is a practical easy way to improve ? says Jack Groppel a study author and a founder of the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute. He points out that the walking breaks did not cause people to feel more tired or hungry but instead had the opposite effect. They also did not alter people?s ability to focus so in theory should not affect productivity (for good or ill). This study however was small in scale   and limited by its dependence on the volunteers? perceptions of their responses to the experiment. But even so ?it?s clear that moving matters? Dr. Groppel says. So set your 2017 appointment calendar he suggests to devote five minutes every hour to physical activity whether you walk up and down a staircase along a corridor or just pace around your office.
48,17338,It?s Time to Ignore Advice About Which Stocks to Buy in 2017 - The New York Times,New York Times,Damon Darlin,1/9/2017,2017,1,,It?s that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the ?Stocks to Buy for 2017. ? Before you take them up on their suggestions let?s look at how well such portfolios did in 2016. The portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all. The results underline what many personal finance experts recommend: Invest in a broad   mutual index fund. (The Times?s ?Your Money? columnist wrote more on this here.) In 2016 the broad S. P. stock index increased 9. 5 percent. But if you invested in Forbes?s 2016 list your money grew about 7 percent. Kiplinger?s was about half that. A list that appeared on the Money magazine site garnered 4. 9 percent and Barron?s returned 5. 3 percent. One such list at CNBC did a little better than most at 10. 6 percent. But Vanguard?s Total Stock index fund returned 12. 5 percent in the same period. We even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested but still none beat the widely owned index fund. There is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating. There were some bona fide winners on almost every list: Goldman Sachs Kennametal Ellie Mae Douglas Dynamics   Burlington Stores. You might not have heard of some of those companies so it?s not a bad place to look for ideas. But the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way. Unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks. But as you can see even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists they don?t do as well as the averages. The best advice remains the same: If you have money you want to play with go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely. If you keep it simple it?s easier to track and respond. But for the rest of us the smart investment is  those index funds. They cost less than stocks or other funds. They remove most of the emotion from your decision making which is the cause of a lot of bad decisions. That?s your best bet in 2017.
49,17339,Megyn Kelly?s Jump to NBC From Fox News Will Test Her and the Networks - The New York Times,New York Times,Jim Rutenberg,1/5/2017,2017,1,,For Megyn Kelly the shift from Fox News to NBC  ?   where she will host a daily daytime show and a Sunday newsmagazine program  ?   will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom. But her move announced Tuesday has broader implications for the television news industry raising new questions about the future of Fox News where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with   ideology and of NBC News which has been a longtime bte noire for conservative press critics. And it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives Jan. 20 with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. The Murdoch family which controls Fox News?s parent company 21st Century Fox had become so invested in Ms. Kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year. People inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the Murdochs were staking the network?s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a Fox News anchor  ?   for instance by publicly taking on the Republican nominee for president. But now Fox News long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no   anchor with Ms. Kelly?s history of challenging Mr. Trump. Her show ?The Kelly File? was sandwiched between the   program of Bill O?Reilly  ?   she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings  ?   and that of Mr. Trump?s major booster Sean Hannity. Her departure coming after that of Greta Van Susteren also means that Fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time. That is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer?s sexual harassment scandal involving its   and former chairman Roger Ailes in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation. (Fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for Ms. Kelly.) For NBC the addition of Ms. Kelly 46 may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations: connecting with a politically diverse audience. In bringing Ms. Kelly to NBC Andrew Lack the chairman of the news division is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative Americans who helped elect Mr. Trump and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate. Ms. Kelly?s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere in which she was often at the center of Mr. Trump?s intense   campaign and in the media world where she became a key figure in the events that led to Mr. Ailes?s ouster. Ms. Kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that Mr. Ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior. (Mr. Ailes has denied all the accusations.) Despite having made a generous offer to Ms. Kelly Rupert Murdoch an executive chairman of 21st Century Fox whose   negotiation tactics are legendary offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave. ?We thank Megyn Kelly for her 12 years of contributions to Fox News? the statement read. ?We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best. ? Though the loss of Ms. Kelly is a blow to Fox News the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years and helped it to avoid the   its rivals experienced in the weeks after Election Day as The Associated Press reported. And now the nation has a new Republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of Fox?s viewers. Company executives said the Murdochs knew Ms. Kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family. Ms. Kelly had spoken with top executives at ABC News CNN and in the syndication industry as well as NBC News but NBC remained largely under the radar as a landing spot. One person briefed on Ms. Kelly?s deliberations said that Mr. Lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking instead of flatly offering possibilities. He then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences. A daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband Douglas Brunt a novelist. People briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity declined to disclose what Ms. Kelly?s new annual salary would be at NBC. Fox News rivals who sought to hire Ms. Kelly away including NBC News had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from Fox the cable news leader for the last 15 years running. But even a modest raise for Ms. Kelly would place her among television?s   journalists. The Wall Street Journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract. Her high price tag was worth it for Mr. Lack who took over leadership of NBC News and MSNBC in 2015 14 years after he had ended an   tenure running the divisions. Executives at NBC Universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor Brian Williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in Iraq and as MSNBC floundered in the ratings. Among his moves since returning has been to direct MSNBC back toward more traditional hard news coverage during its daytime hours  ?   like its cable news rivals it hit record ratings highs last year  ?   and away from its yearslong market position as a   answer to Fox News which at times colored the reputation of its sister NBC News. Ms. Kelly will not be reporting for MSNBC which still has     hosts like Rachel Maddow and Lawrence O?Donnell. In a brief interview Mr. Lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of Ms. Kelly?s daytime show which will run Monday through Friday at a time to be determined as well as the one she will anchor on Sunday nights. That show will be in the vein of CBS?s ?60 Minutes? where Mr. Lack worked early in his career. ?The thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows? he said. ?You don?t get that opportunity that often any more and you don?t get the opportunity to do that with a talent like Megyn. ? Yet the move has its risks for all involved especially the daytime program. Daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars. People involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show nor much like the     special Ms. Kelly hosted last May on the Fox broadcast network which drew some harsh criticism (some of which Ms. Kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with Mr. Trump). In an interview with Charlie Rose on ?CBS Sunday Morning? last year Ms. Kelly described the television show of her fantasies. ?How about if we merge a little Charlie Rose a little Oprah and a little me all together?? she said. ?And we serve that up as an hour? Wouldn?t you watch that?? Ms. Kelly kept a relatively low profile on Tuesday addressing her own news at the end of that night?s edition of ?The Kelly File. ? ?This was a tough decision for me? Ms. Kelly said thanking the Murdochs and attributing the move in part to her desire for more time with her children. Her last show on Fox is on Friday.
50,17340,Anchor Becomes the News as Megyn Kelly Leaves Fox News for NBC - The New York Times,New York Times,John Koblin and Michael M. Grynbaum,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Megyn Kelly?s new office at NBC News sits a block north of Fox News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan. But it might as well be a world away. In switching networks at a pivotal point in her career Ms. Kelly the No.   personality in cable television news is taking a calculated risk that she can swap her dedicated Fox audience for the broader but more fickle viewership of network television. There are challenges from the  . Her splashy arrival has the potential to fray nerves among the big personalities at the network  ?   who already compete against one another for interviews and scoops. Ms. Kelly 46 will also be taking on a daytime talk show format that has been a virtual graveyard for television news personalities in the last 10 years. And the new Sunday newsmagazine show that NBC plans to build around Ms. Kelly will go up against a giant that has not been meaningfully challenged for decades: ?60 Minutes? on CBS. Still Ms. Kelly is a bona fide star with a   book and a breakout role in this year?s presidential campaign when she clashed with Donald J. Trump. NBC News comes out the winner in one of the most closely watched talent sweepstakes in years acquiring one of television?s biggest names who could play a role in any number of major network events like coverage of elections or the Olympics. Interviews on Tuesday with network executives and producers  ?   from Fox NBC and other rival channels  ?   suggest that Ms. Kelly?s performance at NBC will be as closely watched in the industry as her past few months of contract negotiations. Ms. Kelly will have to design her daytime talk show from scratch. Even though she made her name as a news anchor she has argued that she is not obsessed with politics. When she hosted a   special on Fox in May  ?   her first major foray outside cable news  ?   she expressed a desire to combine the qualities of Oprah Winfrey Barbara Walters and Charlie Rose. That special  ?   which featured interviews with Mr. Trump the celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro and the actress Laverne Cox  ?   received middling reviews. It was far from a ratings hit: Among adults younger than 50 the demographic most important to broadcasters Ms. Kelly?s special performed about as well as ABC?s ?Beyond the Tank? a   spinoff. A daily daytime talk show also poses risks.   talent like Jane Pauley Meredith Vieira Katie Couric and Anderson Cooper have taken a stab at the genre in the past and each one failed. In Ms. Pauley?s case NBC invested millions of dollars but the show was yanked in 2005 after just one year. NBC said on Tuesday that Ms. Kelly?s show was expected to be closer to a news program than the typical daytime talk show although it is unclear what exactly that will mean or how much appetite there is for news amid a landscape including shows like ?Days of Our Lives? ?The Ellen DeGeneres Show? and ?Steve Harvey. ? The audience for daytime television is also significantly more diverse than Fox?s   viewership. Starting a Sunday rival to ?60 Minutes? the   among newsmagazines is likewise no easy task. ?Rock Center? which Brian Williams hosted lasted two seasons. NBC?s most recent newsmagazine ?On Assignment? ran    against ?60 Minutes? over five weeks the show averaged about four million viewers compared with more than nine million for ?60 Minutes? which broadcast two repeats during that time. (This season ?60 Minutes? is averaging more than 14 million viewers.) It is also unclear how NBC will accommodate Ms. Kelly?s show during the National Football League season when NBC?s popular ?Sunday Night Football? package includes a highly rated pregame show that begins at 7 p. m. Eastern. But Andrew Lack NBC News?s chairman has long had newsmagazines in his blood. In addition to overseeing a ?60 Minutes? competitor on CBS in the 1980s Mr. Lack presided over NBC in the 1990s when newsmagazines including the network?s popular ?Dateline? dominated   lineups. Fox meanwhile must now set a course without one of its biggest names as the network continues to recalibrate itself after the ouster of its chairman Roger Ailes. Ms. Kelly?s exit from Fox News was so abrupt that it was announced on the day that the network had run a   ad in The Wall Street Journal trumpeting the ratings of its   lineup with Ms. Kelly prominently pictured. Her departure stunned the Fox newsroom where journalists and executives spent Tuesday afternoon speculating over which anchor might replace Ms. Kelly in the coveted 9 p. m. slot  ?   and wondering if Ms. Kelly would even appear that night. When Greta Van Susteren another veteran anchor announced her departure in September network representatives visited her home to tell her not to bother coming in. In the end Ms. Kelly was granted a chance to bid farewell to Fox News viewers  ?   her last show is Friday. It is not clear who will replace her. Fox News has never had an     lineup. Potential replacements being floated inside the network on Tuesday include four women who have regularly filled in for Ms. Kelly: Sandra Smith a host of Fox?s noon show ?Outnumbered? Trish Regan a rising star at Fox Business Network Shannon Bream who covers the Supreme Court and Martha MacCallum a morning anchor. Kimberly Guilfoyle a host of ?The Five? who is friendly with Mr. Trump?s circle and Tucker Carlson who has put up high ratings since taking over Fox News?s 7 p. m. slot have also been suggested. Sean Hannity whose viewership at 10 p. m. increased enormously in 2016 and has spiked since Election Day could be moved up an hour but his momentum in his time slot may make Fox executives reluctant to make a switch. One winner in the sweepstakes for Ms. Kelly could be CNN even though it did not succeed in recruiting her. CNN while still behind Fox News in total viewers by a wide margin has occasionally beaten Fox among viewers 25 to 54 the demographic that determines advertising rates. In 2016 CNN finished within 58 000 viewers of Fox in prime time in the demographic  ?   cutting Fox?s lead in half. Since the election Fox has regained a sizable lead but now without spending a penny CNN will now have an opportunity to take another run at Fox?s   advantage.
51,17341,President Xi?s Great Chinese Soccer Dream - The New York Times,New York Times,Chris Buckley,2/1/2017,2017,2,,QINGYUAN China  ?   The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2 800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day kicking dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches. ?Soccer will be my career after I grow up? Wang Kai a gangly    who has studied at the boarding school for over three years said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. ?I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo? he said referring to the Portuguese superstar. Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China where the country?s No. 1 fan President Xi Jinping is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power. It is a moonshot for China whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world. In the last two weeks the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $40 million a year the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year but he declined his agent said last week. These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. Antonio Conte the manager of England?s fabled Chelsea team denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a ?danger for all teams in the world. ? The drive to match China?s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi?s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. ?My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world?s best? he announced in 2015. In the last two years the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics. It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men?s World Cup and returning the women?s team to its former glory. That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise. ?Current spending has created massive expectations? said Simon Chadwick a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. ?Spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons. ? But if soccer distills Mr. Xi?s national ambitions it also illustrates how his plans could falter as they have in other arenas in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents worried about their children taking precious time away from academics as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent. The pitfalls in fixing soccer it turns out are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick flashy success is putting   goals at risk. People?s Daily the main newspaper of the Communist Party warned last month of a ?bubble? of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations while some clubs officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players the newspaper said. ?One of the biggest problems is ? said Cameron Wilson a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits Wild East Football a website that follows the sport in China. ?There are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the   level in the provinces it?s like people doing their own thing. ? China?s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national men?s team recently placed 83rd in FIFA rankings just ahead of the Faroe Islands a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup. The women?s team  ?   the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades  ?   has stumbled. It was   for the Women?s World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest  rankings. ?The national team is a joke? said Xu Yun 16 who had come to Workers? Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. ?I think it will need decades to get it right. It?s not just a question of spending money it?s attitude. ? For years the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption brazen even by China?s   standards. Since   revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009 the worst cheating has been cleaned up. ?It still exists? Mr. Wilson said. ?Just not so blatantly. ? For Xi soccer has been a passion since childhood. His trips abroad have included photographs with David Beckham and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012 he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball. In September he revisited his old school in Beijing where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game according to memoirs of his former teacher. ?Look how healthy I am? Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. ?I laid the basis for that through sports when I was young. ? Private investors have piled into professional soccer encouraged by Xi?s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government. In the main pro trading season last year the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million according to FIFA TMS a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher. But Mr. Xi?s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His plan calls for 50 000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025 a leap from 5 000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70 000 by the end of 2020 from under 11 000. By then the plan says 50 million Chinese including 30 million students will regularly play soccer. ?Now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer? said Dai Wei the athletic director at r. Xi?s old school the Bayi School. ?That was unthinkable before. ? Yet there is deep cultural resistance even at Bayi. Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports Mr. Dai said because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams. While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age the country has not done as well at fostering group sports where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity. The privately run Evergrande school the world?s biggest soccer boarding school says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players. ?As more soccer schools are built there?ll be more and more kids playing and the stars will multiply too? said Liu Jiangnan the principal of the school which opened in 2012. ?I?d guess that in seven or eight years half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school. ? Drawn by such hopes parents pay up to about $8 700 a year to send children here where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships and children from poorer families get discounts school officials said. But even here the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics said Sergio Zarco Diaz a Spanish coach. ?The kids are getting better year by year? he said hopefully. But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied. Some schools facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields have devised their own drills like soccer gymnastics in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up down and around. It may impress visiting officials but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game said Zhang Lu a widely respected soccer commentator. ?Chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success? Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. ?The problem is that everyone?s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results competition training creating stars. ? Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist   approach he argues. Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields shouting and squealing with delight. ?This morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog? said the principal Lin Yanling. ?But at midday I notified the kids that it was back on and they all went crazy with relief. ?
52,17342,Tech Giants Seem Invincible. That Worries Lawmakers. - The New York Times,New York Times,Farhad Manjoo,1/5/2017,2017,1,,In the technology industry the sharks have never long been safe from the minnows. Over much of the last 40 years the biggest players in tech  ?   from IBM to   to Cisco to Yahoo  ?   were eventually outmaneuvered by   that came out of nowhere. The dynamic is so dependable that it is often taken to be a kind of axiom. To grow large in this business is also to grow slow blind and dumb to become closed off from the very sources of innovation that turned you into a shark in the first place. Then in the last half decade something strange happened: The sharks began to get bigger and smarter. Nearly a year ago I argued that we were witnessing a new era in the tech business one that is typified less by the storied   in a garage than by a posse I like to call the Frightful Five: Amazon Apple Facebook Microsoft and Alphabet Google?s parent company. Together the Five compose a new superclass of American corporate might. For much of last year their further rise and domination over the rest of the global economy looked not just plausible but also maybe even probable. In 2017 much the same story remains but there is a new wrinkle: The world?s governments are newly motivated to take on the tech giants. In the United States Europe Asia and South America the Five find themselves increasingly arrayed against legal and regulatory powers and often even against popular will. The precise nature of the fights varies by company and region including the tax and antitrust investigations of Apple and Google in Europe and Donald J. Trump?s broad and often incoherent criticism of the Five for various alleged misdeeds. This is the story that will shape the contours of the next great era in tech: Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority. So happy New Year. Let?s start with some stats. In 2017 the Five are bigger than ever. As in 2016 they are half of the world?s 10 most valuable companies when measured by stock market value. Their wealth stems from their control of the inescapable digital infrastructure on which much of the rest of the economy depends  ?   mobile phones social networks the web the cloud retail and logistics and the data and computing power required for future breakthroughs. Meanwhile the Five are poised to jump beyond their corner of the lagoon. Over the last few years they have begun to set their sights on the biggest industries outside tech  ?   on autos health care retail transportation entertainment and finance. The Five aren?t exactly immune to business cycles. Apple?s sales were flat last year and after a monster 2016 Alphabet?s stock price hit a plateau. The Five also aren?t entirely safe from competition from   and one of the persistent features of the tech industry is that some of the most perilous threats to giants are the hardest to spot. Still at the moment thanks to smart acquisition strategies and a   outlook the Five sure do look insulated from competition from   today?s most valuable tech upstarts like Airbnb Uber and Snap could grow quite huge and still pose little threat to the collective fortunes of the Frightful Five. What has changed is public perception. For years most of the Five enjoyed broad cultural good will. They were portrayed in the news media as forces of innovation and delight as the best that American capitalism had to offer. The exceptions were Microsoft which reached towering heights through corporate ruthlessness in the 1990s and Amazon which got under people?s skin for among other things making books cheaper and more widely accessible thereby hurting bookstores. But generally people loved tech giants. They had gotten huge just the way you?re supposed to in America  ?   by inventing new stuff that people love. And even their worst sins weren?t considered that bad. They weren?t causing environmental disasters. They weren?t selling cigarettes. They weren?t bringing the world to economic ruin through dangerous financial shenanigans. After I noted the Five?s growing invincibility last year the biggest pushback I got from people at these companies had to do with the moniker I had given them: Why hadn?t I called them the Fabulous Five? Over the last year perception began to change. Familiarity breeds contempt as technology wormed deeper into our lives it began to feel less like an unalloyed good and more like every other annoyance we have to deal with. Silicon Valley grew cloistered missing people?s unease with the speed with which their innovations were changing our lives. When Apple took on the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year over access to a terrorist?s iPhone many in tech sided with the company but a majority of Americans thought Apple should give in. During the long presidential campaign Mr. Trump said a lot of things that people in tech found ridiculous. He vowed to call on Bill Gates to help him shut down the parts of the internet that terrorists were using. He promised to force Apple to make iPhones in America. He suggested that The Washington Post was running critical stories about him because its owner Jeff Bezos was scared that Mr. Trump would pursue antitrust charges against Mr. Bezos?s main company Amazon. Few in the tech industry supported Mr. Trump but the industry?s antipathy seemed to matter little to the public. For years most of the Frightful Five were given the benefit of the doubt as economic disrupters that were undercutting the cultural and economic power of the big industries that many people despised  ?   entertainment giants cable and phone companies and the news media among others. ?During the periods where incumbents are battling disrupters in general the U. S. has done a good job of encouraging disrupters? said Julius Genachowski the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who is now a partner at the Carlyle Group a private equity firm. That describes the general direction of policy during the Obama administration. The tech giants were less giant for much of the Obama years and various parts of the United States regulatory and legal infrastructure sought to protect and nurture them. During Mr. Genachowski?s term at the F. C. C. and then again during the term of his successor Tom Wheeler the commission passed rules favoring ?network neutrality? which declared that telecommunications companies could not favor some kinds of content online over others. It was a policy broadly favored by tech companies. But as Mr. Genachowski noted as the disrupters grow the dynamic often shifts. ?The next part of the arc is that disrupters become very successful and in some ways turn into incumbents and then you see two things  ?   battles between incumbents and other incumbents and a next generation of disrupters tackling incumbents? he said. That?s where we are now. The Five have become incumbents themselves and they are more likely to be treated as such by governments who will look to both sides of the ledger  ?   their benefits to society as well as their potential costs  ?   when deciding how to police them. But there?s a twist: With the Five unlike in previous eras of tech it is not clear that there are many potential disrupters among today?s  . The battles for dominance in cloud services artificial intelligence and data mining   assistants   cars virtual reality and most every other Next Big Thing are being waged among the Five. That could likely raise the hackles of regulators and lawmakers even more and depending on your position on corporate power versus governmental power things could be fabulous or frightful.
53,17344,Chinese City Official Shoots 2 Others and Kills Himself State Media Says - The New York Times,New York Times,Chris Buckley and Adam Wu,1/5/2017,2017,1,,BEIJING  ?   A city official in southwest China unleashed a barrage of gunfire on the city?s mayor and Communist Party secretary during a meeting on Wednesday injuring them before fleeing and killing himself the official news media reported. Privately owned guns are rare in China because of a virtual ban on civilian use and grisly attacks on officials by colleagues are also uncommon. So rumors of the shooting in Panzhihua an industrial city in Sichuan Province rippled quickly across the Chinese internet even before the local authorities confirmed the news. Panzhihua was built as part of Mao?s plans to relocate factories deep inland where they would be protected from a feared war. But the violence in this isolated site was nonetheless an embarrassing breach of the efforts by China?s president Xi Jinping to remake officialdom into a clean impeccably disciplined bureaucracy. Details were sparse and there were no clues to the gunman?s motives. But the brief initial report in the state media sketched a scene of the head of the Panzhihua Land and Resources Bureau Chen Zhongshu bursting into a meeting at an exhibition center and opening fire on officials there. ?The gunman stormed into the meeting fired repeatedly at the main leading comrades of the city party committee and government and then fled? said an online report by Sichuan Daily an official provincial newspaper citing the Panzhihua government press office. The suspect in the shooting Mr. Chen was found dead in the exhibition center. He had taken his own life the report said without giving details. The mayor Li Jianqin and party secretary Zhang Yan were wounded and sent to the hospital but their injuries were not considered   the report said. Mr. Zhang the party secretary has worked in Panzhihua since 2006 and the mayor Mr. Li has worked there since last year according to Chinese news reports. Both officials went to meetings and inspection visits with Mr. Chen previously but there was nothing in the earlier reports to suggest that trouble had been brewing. Photographs on Chinese news websites showed armored vehicles and paramilitary troops massed outside the exhibition center in the aftermath of the violence.
54,17345,Drop in Gang Violence Drove New York City Shootings Below 1000 in 2016 - The New York Times,New York Times,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,1/4/2017,2017,1,,A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a   Police Department data shows a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the city?s roughest neighborhoods. The internal police data obtained by The New York Times paints a detailed portrait of the motives locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years.   shootings fell to 412 in 2016 from 560 the year before according to the data which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year.   killings dropped to 79 in 2016 from 129 in 2015. Those   helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by year?s end police officials said down from 1 138 in 2015. Murders also fell to 335 from 352 the year before. The New York City police commissioner James P. O?Neill has noted the department?s efforts to push shootings below 1 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s when the police began keeping similar records. Mr. O?Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday. Scores of gang takedowns this year resulting in about 900 arrests took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in   crimes police officials said. ?Precision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence which in a significant amount of cases are gangs? said Stephen P. Davis the department?s chief spokesman. ?By going after the gang members arresting them we recognize the resultant reduction in violence. ? Violent crime has been more persistent  in some communities especially outside Manhattan. But the Police Department in continuing to drive down crime even as it has pulled back from heavy   enforcement and aggressive tactics like    has shown the value of focusing resources on stopping serious crime said David M. Kennedy a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ?New York City in many ways convinced the rest of the country that things like zero tolerance were the way to make communities safe? he said. ?And now it?s showing the country that you absolutely do not need to do that you should not do it and there are much much better and less damaging ways to work with communities to produce public safety. ? The reductions in New York stand in stark contrast to some other cities most notably Chicago which had a sharp increase in murders and shootings in 2016 and ended the year with 762 homicides. The New York Police Department data offers a rare glimpse into the more granular ways that the department?s Detective Bureau tracks and classifies crime as well as the   tangle of reasons that people are shot and killed. Shootings and murders dropped across almost every category of motive last year. Murders in which drugs were the primary motive for example dropped to 29 in 2016 from 42 the year before. But domestic killings rose slightly to 57 last year from 49 in 2015. Criminologists believe gang enforcement can result in arrests of people who are also domestic offenders but they say that domestic violence remains more difficult to prevent because it can escalate inside homes without the police being notified. Mr. Kennedy said that efforts in smaller jurisdictions across the country to respond to the earliest signs of domestic violence and to punish repeat offenders were showing results but that those strategies would be more difficult to replicate in a city the size of New York. Fewer people were murdered with guns in 2016 but the number of people killed by cutting rose to 73 from 50 the year before. Murders and shootings on the street in public housing and in commercial locations all dropped last year through Dec. 28. Murders on playgrounds climbed to 12 from three the year before and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles. More broadly murders indoors ticked up by 19 while outdoor murders fell by 49. About a third of shootings and murders occurred between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. and more than half happened between 6 p. m. and 2 a. m. The biggest share of murders were motivated by what the police call a ?dispute. ? Of those the largest share had to do with words that were exchanged followed by disputes over a man or woman over money and over a previous history. Five murders in 2016 were deemed to be motivated by a stare or a disrespectful act two by gambling and two by road rage. Just under a third of the shooting cases last year were closed with an arrest and 22 percent of the cases were closed because the police had exhausted all leads. Forty percent of the murder cases were closed with an arrest and eight others were termed an exceptional clearance a category that would include cases in which the person suspected of being the killer was murdered before an arrest was made.
55,17346,How ?Elites? Became One of the Nastiest Epithets in American Politics - The New York Times,New York Times,Beverly Gage,1/7/2017,2017,1,,Our new president is a    billionaire Ivy League graduate a real estate tycoon a TV star and a son of inherited wealth. But he is no longer by his own calculations a member of the ?elite. ?

The true elite apparently sits elsewhere among those who in Sarah Palin?s notable 2008 formulation think ?that they?re  ?   I guess  ?   better than anyone else. ? As an adjective the word ?elite? still conveys something positive even aspirational: elite athlete elite model elite travel services. But as a noun embodied by actual living people it has become one of the nastiest epithets in American politics. ?Elites have taken all the upside for themselves and pushed the downside to the   and   Americans? complains Trump?s adviser Steve Bannon (of Harvard Goldman Sachs and Hollywood). In this formulation elites are a destructive condescending collective plotting against the beleaguered masses outside their ranks. And in these attacks the   and his team are deploying one of the most effective partisan political stereotypes of the modern age. For most of American history   sentiment was a matter of up versus down not left versus right. But about half a century ago the conservative movement set out to claim   politics as its own. That meant redefining the term away from class and toward culture where the ?elite? could be identified by its liberal ideas coastal real estate and highbrow consumer preferences. The   Club for Growth captured this type in a famous 2004 attack ad instructing the Democrat Howard Dean to ?take his           New York         freak show back to Vermont where it belongs. ? Trump adjusted the formula for the hot topics of the 2016 campaign. ?I was on the right side of that issue as you know with the people? he boasted after Brexit adding that ?Hillary as always stood with the elites. ? His complaints against ?political correctness? conjure a world of absurdist campus politics where overprivileged students squabble over gender pronouns and the fine points of racial victimization. ?Media elites? come in for special attack cordoned off in pens to be mocked and jeered at during rallies labeled both liars and incompetents. But Trump has also ventured beyond mere   turning the 2016 election into a competition between knowledge systems: the      ?people? versus the    ?elites. ? His campaign insisted for months that pollsters and technocrats and media would be proven wrong by his electoral success. The fact that he did win dealt a blow to an entire worldview one in which empirical inquiry and   were supposed to triumph in the end. The question now is whether it?s possible to run an executive branch based on hostility toward experts and professionals of all political stripes  ?   and how many billionaires and Ivy Leaguers Trump can appoint before this rhetorical pose begins to break down altogether. The notion that distant elites might be conspiring against the people comes straight from the Founding Fathers whose Declaration of Independence lamented the ?long train of abuses and usurpations? inflicted upon ordinary Americans by an arrogant British king. From there on United States history might be seen as a repeating cycle of   revolt. The Jacksonians rebelled against the Founders? aristocratic pretensions. Northern ?free labor? went to war against the oligarchical slavocracy. And the Populist revolts of the late 19th century adapted this story to modern capitalism with farmers and laborers rebelling against robber barons bankers   experts and   professionals. The first historians to study those Populists described them as heroic crusaders champions of the ?people? against the ?powers. ? But by the middle of the 20th century alarmed by the rise of fascism and homegrown demagogues like Senator Joseph McCarthy a new generation of scholars took a more anxious view of the   spirit. In his 1955 book ?The Age of Reform? Richard Hofstadter dismissed the Populists as   provincial   the latent fascists of their day. Eight years later his ?  in American Life? documented a dangerous suspicion of ?the critical mind? that seemed to course through the national culture. From his perspective the 1952 election captured everything wrong with American political life with Dwight Eisenhower?s ?philistinism? winning over Adlai Stevenson?s ?intellect. ? Hofstadter did not usually describe his ideal intellectually minded citizens as members of an ?elite. ? That word conveyed something different  ?   a ruling class that held direct political and economic power. The most famous articulation of this view came from the sociologist C. Wright Mills in his 1956 assessment of America?s ?power elite. ? ?They rule the big corporations? Mills wrote. ?They run the machinery of the state and claim its prerogatives. They direct the military establishment. ? In Mills?s view these people were tied together not by culture or ideology but by their positions at the helms of large    institutions. As individuals they might be Republicans or Democrats and might live in Ohio or California. The point was that they were in charge of things. But that vision never gained much traction in mainstream politics where a more partisan targeted definition was starting to emerge. William F. Buckley Jr. carved out some essentials in his first book ?God and Man at Yale? drawing a neat distinction between respectable   men like himself and the socialistic eggheads of the professoriate. Ronald Reagan chose the term ?elite? to bring it all together in his famed 1964 speech ?A Time for Choosing? delivered on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. ?This is the issue of this election? he said: ?whether we believe in our capacity for   or whether we abandon the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a   capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves. ? Lyndon Johnson won that election in a blowout but Reagan?s vision of a smug and detached liberal elite helped spark the oncoming ?culture wars? pitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts. By the 1990s with the rise of   media stars like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O?Reilly bashing the ?liberal elite? had become a favorite blood sport of the American right. Despite all the abuse hurled their way some ?liberal elites? have accepted at least part of their detractors? critique particularly on the progressive left. It was during Bill Clinton?s presidency that the social critic Christopher Lasch published ?The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy? which mourned that ?   liberals? had turned into ?petulant   intolerant? scolds thoroughly out of touch with the concerns of Middle America. Since then the torch has passed to a younger generation of writers including MSNBC?s Chris Hayes whose 2012 ?Twilight of the Elites? called for rethinking the entire ethos of liberal ?meritocracy?  ?   a system he argued that tends to fuel   and incompetence at the top while offering little but contempt and dim prospects for those at the bottom. So as 2017 begins we find ourselves in a strange and uncertain political moment. Antipathy toward a wealthy preening managerial class seems to be gaining popularity across the political spectrum  ?   and oddly to have helped elect a wealthy preening incoming president. Meanwhile both liberal and conservative ?elites? are scrambling to figure out what happens if the   continues to reject basic political norms and even routine intelligence briefings. Under a Trump presidency such ?elites? may have no choice but to attempt a radical redefinition of their role in American life. Otherwise the man in the White House will do it for them.
56,17347,10 Engaging Proposals From the Rooftop to the Subway - The New York Times,New York Times,Vincent M. Mallozzi,1/7/2017,2017,1,,?Will you marry me?? Hundreds of thousands of potential grooms and brides pop that question every year and yet the logistics of delivering that momentous phrase  ?   where to do it when to do it and how much of a surprise should it be  ?   remains among the most important decisions anyone planning on getting married has to make. Some of the couples whose wedding announcements were featured in the pages of The New York Times this past year or whose weddings The Times learned about got engaged in unusual spots  ?   from a Manhattan rooftop to a subway construction site below the city?s streets  ?   and one proposal even involved seeking advice from President Obama. And of course at least several can now be found on YouTube. Here are 10 of our most engaging stories of the year. Mr. Litman who first began dating Ms. Michelis in the eighth grade at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx proposed in November 2015 in Montauk N. Y. the entire scene captured by a drone hovering above on an unusually warm   day at the beach. With waves rushing the shore and the Montauk Point Lighthouse in the distance Ms. Michelis can be seen from a windblown aerial view playfully running beneath the drone before turning back to Mr. Litman. As she runs closer he drops to his knee engagement ring in hand. Momentarily shocked at the sight she drops her purse as he asks her to marry him and the two then fall into each other?s arms. ?The first thing that came to my mind was I can?t wait to show it to our kids? Ms. Michelis said. They were married Oct. 8. The couple first met in fall 2011 while working on the digital team for Mr. Obama?s   campaign. After the president?s victory Mr. Fallsgraff became the digital director of Organizing for Action the nonprofit organization that manages the social media and digital accounts for Mr. Obama. In 2015 Mr. Fallsgraff and his team were filming a video with Mr. Obama at a hotel in Washington during the Organizing for Action Spring Organizing Summit. Knowing he was planning to leave in June Mr. Fallsgraff took the opportunity to talk with the president and told him that he was bent on proposing (which he would do three months later). ?You got a rock picked out and all that?? he recalled Mr. Obama asking. Mr. Fallsgraff told him he had yet to get the ring and asked if the president had any advice. Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Fallsgraff get help from someone Ms. Wilson trusted and who understood her taste. When Mr. Fallsgraff suggested that he was thinking of asking Ms. Wilson?s best friend the president responded ?I think that?s the right strategy but you?ve got to swear her to secrecy. ? The next time Mr. Fallsgraff saw Ms. Wilson?s best friend he pulled her aside. ?I told her I had a mission for her from the president of the United States? he said. Mission accomplished. Mr. Fallsgraff and Ms. Wilson were married July 3. The couple who met in June 2015 through a dating app called the League went to Paris six months later for a New Year?s celebration. While at a restaurant there Mr. Purcell ordered a bottle of Champagne for what he thought was 110 euros the equivalent of about $119. But when the bill arrived after dinner he realized he had mistakenly ordered a bottle of vintage Champagne  ?   the 2003 Dom Prignon Ros  ?   at a cost of 1 100 euros a total at the time of roughly $1 195. In May Mr. Purcell invited Ms. Bui to the rooftop of his apartment building in San Francisco to enjoy the unobstructed   view that included the Golden Gate Bridge. As they took in the view Mr. Purcell surprised Ms. Bui by breaking out an expensive bottle of the same vintage Champagne he had mistakenly bought in Paris. It was all a part of a special occasion he told her and then he surprised her again this time with an engagement ring. They were married Nov. 26. The couple who met in 2007 while they were working for the New York City Department of City Planning became engaged in May 2014 when Mr. Meagher proposed while they were on a tour of the construction site of the 86th Street station part of the Second Avenue subway. The tour conducted below street level included residents who live near the new subway line as well as officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ?We?re both passionate about cities and infrastructure? Mr. Meagher said. And about each other as the group learned when Mr. Meagher wearing a hard hat and an orange safety vest got down on one knee and asked Ms. Grossman who was wearing the same gear to marry him. Gasps then applause broke out among the tour group as well as from the bride?s parents who had also shown up for the occasion. They were married Jan. 9. The couple met in August 2014 during a performance of the Broadway musical ?A Gentleman?s Guide to Love and Murder. ? Mr. Fogelman who was there alone tried to move to an empty seat next to Ms. Phillips to get a better view of the stage. ?Not in the middle of a song? said Ms. Phillips who was there with a friend. Mr. Fogelman waited until after the song to switch seats and at intermission he apologized profusely to her for his poor theater etiquette. She forgave him he sat down next to her and they began talking. They were soon dating and in August 2015 while sitting in those same seats Mr. Fogelman turned to Ms. Phillips at intermission and proposed. ?It turned out to be a wonderful   at the theater? Ms. Phillips said ?one that I will never forget. ? They were married Sept. 4. Mr. Whelden a plumber in Boston who sings with two professional   touring a cappella groups (Five O?Clock Shadow and Overboard) proposed during his performance at a New Year?s Eve concert in Rockport Mass. The crowd roared when he sang ?Fall in Love? a song he wrote for his future bride that included the words ?will you marry me. ? ?It was the most amazing romantic proposal I could?ve ever imagined? Ms. Delaney said. They were married May 7. The couple who were both living in Park Slope Brooklyn met through OkCupid in early 2011. They immediately became a couple. In July 2015 they moved into a   together in Bay Ridge. On their first day in the new place Ms. Roth put in motion her proposal while Ms. Marini was at work. She was hiding when Ms. Marini returned and watched her follow a path of lighted candles to a makeshift bed where Chinese food boxes had been placed across the floor leading to a smaller box. (?Melina had always idealized the movie trope of people moving into a new apartment that?s not yet furnished and having to eat Chinese food on the floor ? Ms. Roth explained.) When Ms. Marini opened the smaller box which contained an engagement ring she started sobbing. Along with the ring was a note that said: ?Will you marry me? Check yes or no. ? Ms. Marini checked ?yes? and she and Ms. Roth who came out of hiding cried in each other?s arms. ?I?m not the type of person who wants to see ?Will you marry me?? splashed across a Jumbotron? Ms. Marini said. ?This was much more intimate to me and much more meaningful. ? They were married Aug. 6. The couple met on March 11 2005 while shooting pool in what Ms. Powell described as a dim smoky bar on Avenue B in Manhattan. They shared several beers then a single kiss outside the bar. Mr. Albertson 23 at the time was beyond taken with her but Ms. Powell then 20 was not quite ready for a serious relationship. They settled on becoming friends. Ms. Powell eventually married another man and fell out of touch with Mr. Albertson. By May 2014 however Ms. Powell was divorced and dating Mr. Albertson often telling him that the word ?marriage? now frightened her. On March 11 2015 10 years to the day they met they were back on Avenue B and heading into that same dim smoky bar when Ms. Powell looked down and saw a huge chalk mark indicating the spot where she had first kissed him. She turned to find him down on one knee holding her engagement ring. ?I was freaking out? she said. ?I just started crying and hugging him. ? He proposed but managed to avoid scaring her by leaving out the word ?marriage. ? ?I was wondering? he said ?if you wanted to hang out with me forever. ? They were married March 11. Mr. Turke who proposed in February chose to give his future bride a full day of   bliss rather than a single moment of happiness. An hour after he sneaked out of their apartment at 6 a. m. he called her with instructions to go into their kitchen where she found a huge bouquet of white lilies with several notes that he had left for her including one that read ?Today is the day that we get engaged? and another that read ?Enjoy the moments ahead of you have fun and say ?yes. ?? What ensued was a dizzying series of events that first took Ms. Helmling to the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan where she found her three best friends waiting at a breakfast table. A waiter then gave them a note with instructions to walk across the street to a spa where they each enjoyed Champagne and a massage before being whisked away for manicures and pedicures. Later in the day Ms. Helmling was chauffeured over the George Washington Bridge to a small park in New Jersey overlooking the Hudson River  ?   the spot where Mr. Turke had first asked her out in September 2013. ?When she arrived we hugged and cried and she told me all about her day? said Mr. Turke who also presented a slide show that included every photo that had both of them in it arranged in chronological order as a way of telling their story. Then he proposed and Ms. Helmling cried some more. They were married Nov. 13. The couple met online in 2008. At the time Mr. Stucky was living in Somerville Mass. and going through a divorce. They were soon dating but their relationship began to sputter. In the space of three years each of them proposed to the other and each was soundly rejected. In June 2014 Ms. Mathiowetz was partying with friends in New York when she consumed too many psychedelic mushrooms. The episode left her paralyzed for nearly six hours  ?   and longing again for Mr. Stucky whom she was no longer seeing. ?I can?t believe I haven?t been telling you every day that I love you? she called to tell him the moment she got back on her feet. Mr. Stucky was feeling much the same way as he too had had a   experience he said a nightmare in which he was on his knees and looking up at a stranger who was telling him he had only 24 hours to live. Completely shaken he awoke and began taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him and quickly realized that Ms. Mathiowetz was at the top of that list. Those shared experiences brought them back together and in January 2015 Mr. Stucky proposed to Ms. Mathiowetz for a second time during a weekend trip at a    in Portsmouth N. H. This time she accepted. They were married June 11.
57,17348,For a Mother With Big Dreams Two Forbidden Words: ?I Can?t? - The New York Times,New York Times,John Grippe,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Alicia Rivera a    single mother with four children and big dreams must budget her money and her time wisely. ?I got my kids? Ms. Rivera said. ?I don?t want to waste my time. ? Ms. Rivera and her children  ?   Joaquin 17 Nelson 16 Alyssa 11 and Rafael 2  ?   live in a   apartment in the Bronx near the southern tip of the Bronx River Parkway. The past few years have sometimes been overwhelming for her as she tries to raise her children by herself get an education and lay the foundation for a professional career. When she was seven months pregnant with Rafael Ms. Rivera injured her back while working as a home health aide. Soon after he was born she switched to another job helping   people navigate complicated real estate and tax forms and other paperwork. Ms. Rivera makes about $100 every week. She also receives $216 a month in Supplemental Security Income and $506 a month in food stamps. With a monthly rent of $308 she needs to keep a frugal budget. But Ms. Rivera has a plan. She is on track to receive an associate degree from Plaza College in April. Her goal is to then earn a bachelor?s degree and a master?s degree both in business from Metropolitan College of New York. She dreams of opening a dance studio in the Bronx. Ms. Rivera grew up in the Bronx with a mother who could not afford to send her to dance classes. But she loved dancing in front of the family?s television as they watched the   variety show ?Sbado Gigante. ? ?And you see these kids dancing and you see me dancing in the living room too? Ms. Rivera said. ?I used to wear my mom?s makeup her heels. ? Ms. Rivera passed on her love of dancing to her children especially Joaquin who leads a dance team at his school the Knowledge and Power Preparatory Academy near Fordham University in the Bronx. She watched him at a dance rehearsal at the school and she said the students? moves reminded her of the ?Step Up? movie series. ?Made me laugh made me have a good time? she said. ?I felt like joining them? she said beaming. At times Ms. Rivera has struggled to balance her obligations at home school and work. As she devoted more time to her studies her son Nelson who attends the same academy as Joaquin started having trouble at school. A counselor there contacted her saying that Nelson did not want to go to class. The counselor referred her to the Family Assistance Program which soon referred them to the Children?s Aid Society one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. At Children?s Aid Ms. Rivera said she learned how to improve her parenting. She said she used to get frustrated and yell at Nelson when he struggled to get up and get ready in the morning. A counselor told her that yelling at him was not going to solve the problem. Therapy sessions with the family also made it clear that her sons needed their own rooms. Ms. Rivera said she started to notice positive changes at home after several months of therapy. Her older sons now have their own rooms. Alyssa agreed to share a room with her mother and Rafael. Her elder sons are more focused now. Nelson comes to her with problems not letting them linger and they work them out together. Joaquin is starting to research colleges. The Children?s Aid Society also provided Ms. Rivera $413 in Neediest funds to replace her sons? broken beds with new ones. Nelson and a friend put them together she said. While still attending school Nelson is taking some online courses which cost $49 a month. Ms. Rivera wants to withdraw Nelson to take online classes full time so that she can monitor his schoolwork more carefully. In addition to opening a dance school Ms. Rivera wants to start a business similar to her present workplace. While the family has learned to resolve problems Ms. Rivera refuses to lower her expectations. She bristles when she hears her children or their friends say they cannot do something. ?Don?t say ?I can?t?? she said. ?Joaquin never says ?I can?t? because he hears me. ? That is one way she lays the foundation for her children?s future. Ms. Rivera said Alyssa was struggling one day with homework. So she took time out of her own schoolwork encouraged her daughter and patiently walked her through the steps of writing a   essay. ?It took her three hours and when she was done I said ?You see? You could do it. ??
58,17349,Senate Republicans Open Fight Over Obama Health Law - The New York Times,New York Times,Thomas Kaplan and Glenn Thrush,1/5/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   Congress opened for battle over the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday as Republicans pushed immediately forward to repeal the health care law and President Obama made a rare trip to Capitol Hill to defend it. The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act Mr. Obama?s signature health care law has created online insurance marketplaces offered new protections to people seeking health insurance and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. ?The American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country? Mr. Pence said ?and we are determined to give them that. ? He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance however and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the new Democratic leader playing off Mr. Trump?s campaign slogan said repealing the law would ?make America sick again. ? Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democrats? being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday the Senate took the first step agreeing to take up a budget resolution or blueprint that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law which has become deeply enmeshed with America?s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to ?be careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster? and added ?Don?t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ? Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would ?fall of its own weight. ? Representative Chris Collins of New York a Republican who is one of Mr. Trump?s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. ?We have to make sure we keep reminding America we are repealing it because it failed we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it? Mr. Collins said. ?And that was a key piece of Donald Trump?s campaign. ? But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. ?There will naturally be a reasonable transition period? said Senator Ted Cruz Republican of Texas. ?You can?t adopt new reforms all at once. ? Senator John Cornyn of Texas the No. 2 Senate Republican noted that it had taken six years to get into ?the ditch we find ourselves in now. ? ?When your truck or car is in a ditch the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch? Mr. Cornyn said. ?And sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. ? To that Senator Debbie Stabenow Democrat of Michigan parried that when a car goes into a ditch ?the first thing I don?t do is dismantle the car. ? ?That doesn?t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation? she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year Republicans would ?regret that they came out so fast out of the box. ? He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. ?If you are repealing show us what you?ll replace it with first? Mr. Schumer said. ?Then we?ll look at what you have and see what we can do. ? Later Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump ?It?s his and their responsibility plain and simple  ?   name calling isn?t going to get anything done. ? He added ?They really need to calm things down a little. ? Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. ?The point is in 2017 we don?t want people to be caught with nothing? he said. ?We want to make sure that there?s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. ? Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicans? rollback effort. In reality the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a ?pep rally? for Affordable Care Act defenders in the words of an attendee Representative Hank Johnson Democrat of Georgia. The gathering which could be Mr. Obama?s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat had a     air with numerous Democratic lawmakers including Mr. Johnson sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the president?s words. Mr. Obama for his part did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law but warned Democrats against ?rescuing? Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley Democrat of Oregon said ?He acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. ?
59,17350,The Parliamentary Tactic That Could Obliterate Obamacare - The New York Times,New York Times,Robert Pear,1/5/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation?s most important laws. ?Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget? the Congressional Research Service a nonpartisan arm of Congress has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  ?   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue deficit debt and spending levels in areas like defense energy education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  ?   reconciled with  ?   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980 Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the ?Reagan revolution. ? It squeezed savings out of Social Security Medicare Medicaid food stamps the school lunch program farm subsidies student loans welfare and jobless benefits among many other programs. In 1996 Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation?s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the Children?s Health Insurance Program primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997 Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year with support from   Donald J. Trump who calls the law ?an absolute disaster. ? Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate by contrast one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders? plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd Democrat of West Virginia generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could for example eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate for example that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person?s   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26 and they cannot charge women higher rates than men as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance and without subsidies supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference altering the votes of individual lawmakers and changing the contents of a reconciliation bill.
60,17352,In Republicans? Ethics Office Gambit a Spectacle of Tweets and Retreats - The New York Times,New York Times,Carl Hulse,1/5/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   Majorities in Congress often overreach but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday couldn?t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans then Republicans frantically reverse course. ?Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp? Representative Walter B. Jones Republican of North Carolina said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. ?That is not a good way to start. ? Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn?t be a top priority urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ?s Twitter posts underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump?s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump?s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated ?earmarks? as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump?s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics comprising lawmakers from both parties was ineffective given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then as well as now and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  ?   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  ?   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. ?I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner? said John Feehery a former top Republican aide in the House. ?It protects you from political attacks. ? The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. ?I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that if anything we need to bring sunshine in? Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now.
61,17353,Ivanka Trump?s New Washington Home Once Belonged to a Putin Foe - The New York Times,New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,1/23/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   Ivanka Trump who is weighing a prominent role in her father?s administration is planning to move with her family to a mansion in the exclusive Kalorama section of Washington two people familiar with the decision said Wednesday. The house was previously owned by a   financier with extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader. Ms. Trump and her husband Jared Kushner a close adviser to   Donald J. Trump who is expected to be an influential voice in the administration have chosen a      house just around the corner from President Obama?s new home. The newly renovated house with its sleekly modern dcor sold for $5. 5 million in December the people said insisting on anonymity because the transaction was private. The home was previously owned by Dan K. Rapoport and his wife Irina according to property records filed with the District of Columbia. Neither responded to emailed requests for comment. Ms. Trump?s relocation plans first reported by Washingtonian magazine are the latest evidence that she and Mr. Kushner will remain major players in Mr. Trump?s administration. Both played crucial roles in his presidential bid and have wielded outsize power during his transition. People close to the couple declined to comment on their impending move as did William F. X. Moody a   at Washington Fine Properties who first disclosed the deal. But in the neighborhood where they are planning to live  ?     of ambassadors and prominent figures on the Washington social circuit  ?   residents have been buzzing about their    neighbors. ?Everybody?s atwitter about it? said Tony Podesta chairman of the Podesta Group a top Washington lobbying firm. ?I?ve been getting lots of emails saying ?Here we go again? ? Mr. Podesta said alluding to the burst of local mayhem that attended the decision by Mr. Obama and his family to rent a   home in the neighborhood after they leave the White House. ?It will be great to have them as neighbors? Mr. Podesta said of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner who have three children. The white house on Tracy Place where Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner plan to live with their children is just around the corner from the Obamas? luxurious   home on Belmont Road which has been undergoing extensive renovations directed by the Secret Service to fortify it for their arrival. A security checkpoint is expected to be built at the intersection of Tracy and Belmont before Mr. Obama moves in residents said. There was no sign of Ms. Trump or her husband at the house on Wednesday afternoon. But the property was a flurry of activity as workers and painters filed in and out past television reporters staked out on the sidewalk and   speculated about their new neighbors. John Damgard who has owned a house on the block since 1971 said his new neighbors could expect to be welcomed ?with open arms? even by the neighborhood?s Democrats. ?It?s quiet it?s private and they?ll be graciously received? Mr. Damgard said. The house was home for several decades to Renee Zlotnick Kraft a Washington fur heiress and socialite who frequently opened its doors for events and even occasionally rolled out a pink carpet to welcome the city?s dinner party set. According to the website of his investment firm Rapoport Capital Mr. Rapoport was born in Riga Latvia and has lived in the United States France and Russia. Vladimir Ashurkov a top aide to Aleksei A. Navalny a leading Russian opposition leader and critic of the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin described Mr. Rapoport as a successful financier in Moscow and an investor in Soho Rooms one of the city?s poshest nightclubs. He has also been a supporter of Mr. Navalny since 2010. He recently relocated from Washington to Kiev Ukraine where he manages a private equity fund Mr. Ashurkov said. It was not clear whether Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner bought the house from the Rapoports or would be renting it from a new owner. But after scouting locations in other exclusive neighborhoods including nearby Georgetown the couple settled on a home less than two miles from the White House.
62,17354,Donald Trump Nominates Wall Street Lawyer to Head S.E.C. - The New York Times,New York Times,Leslie Picker,1/5/2017,2017,1,,The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider?s insider  ?   a deal maker. As such his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast the agency?s two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton known as Jay has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a   seat to the financial crisis advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings including the biggest ever the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White the agency?s current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise  Plimpton where her clients included JPMorgan Chase Rupert Murdoch?s News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis a former Bank of America chief executive. Still such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger a former commissioner and acting chairwoman said that during her tenure she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission?s ethics officer. ?An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts? she noted. Yet Mr. Clayton?s nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan  Cromwell where Mr. Clayton is a partner has been Goldman?s   law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett?s Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton?s wife works as a   adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldman?s No. 2 executive Gary D. Cohn to be the top economic policy adviser to   Donald J. Trump and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump?s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22 said in a statement that the lawyer ?will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time. ? Mr. Clayton is expected to face scrutiny on his confirmation as a Sullivan  Cromwell colleague H. Rodgin Cohen did in 2009. Mr. Cohen the dean of Wall Street lawyers withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role amid an outcry over his deep involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. ?It?s hard to see how an attorney who spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep   Trump?s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ?getting away with murder?? Senator Sherrod Brown Democrat of Ohio said. ?I look forward to hearing how Mr. Clayton will protect retirees and savers from being exploited demand real accountability from financial institutions the S. E. C. oversees and work to prevent another financial crisis. ? One issue could be Mr. Clayton?s representation of Alibaba. The Chinese   giant is under investigation by the S. E. C. over its accounting practices. Mr. Clayton also represented   Capital Management in its $1. 2 billion initial public offering a decade ago and subsequent offerings and financing. A unit of the New   hedge fund pleaded guilty for what federal prosecutors said were more than $100 million in bribes paid to officials in African countries. The hedge fund was forced to pay a $400 million settlement. Government authorities said in September that they were still investigating individuals related to case. Another issue could be a 2011 report critical of the government?s enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which argued that ?the current   regime? was ?causing lasting harm to the competitiveness of U. S. regulated companies and the U. S. capital markets. ? Mr. Clayton was the chairman of the New York City bar association committee that drafted the report. Requests to speak with Mr. Clayton at Sullivan  Cromwell were not answered. A number of fellow deal lawyers said they were glad that the    practitioner could be at the helm of the S. E. C. ?He?s a very smart pragmatic guy who has real deal experience and has seen this stuff firsthand? said Richard Truesdell a head of Davis Polk?s global capital markets group who has worked with Mr. Clayton on several deals. ?There?s been a lot of buzz today and I have yet to talk to anyone who isn?t pleasantly surprised by the choice. ? The role of the Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors and enable companies to raise capital through the public markets in a way that fosters economic growth. The latter is a key tenet of Mr. Trump?s economic plan with the aim that companies can use the excess capital to create jobs. Harvey Pitt a former chairman of the S. E. C. appointed by President George W. Bush said Mr. Clayton was a ?  appointment. ? ?It is especially logical with respect to the agency?s obligation to promote capital formation a subject with which the incoming administration is appropriately concerned? said Mr. Pitt in an email. ?Mr. Clayton?s background is very impressive  ?   both for the depth of his experience and for the quality of his efforts. ? Mr. Clayton went to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cambridge for separate bachelor?s degrees and then obtained his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Mr. Clayton donated to Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama in previous presidential elections and to Jeb Bush?s primary campaign in 2015 according to public records. Those who know Mr. Clayton describe him as the     type a doer who is often in the shadows of the better known Mr. Cohen at Sullivan  Cromwell. ?When I think about the position the guy has a really deep understanding of the capital markets and financial regulatory matters so he checks those boxes? said Brad Whitman vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley who has worked with Mr. Clayton over many years. ?He?s got a great appreciation for what drives business and growth. ?
63,17355,Dylann Roof Addressing Court Offers No Apology or Explanation for Massacre - The New York Times,New York Times,Alan Blinder and Kevin Sack,1/6/2017,2017,1,,CHARLESTON S. C.  ?   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  ?   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  ?   and left it at that. ?Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn?t and the fact that I?m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who?s ever existed there?s nothing wrong with me psychologically? Mr. Roof who is representing himself told the jury which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston?s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern Mr. Roof returned to the defense table exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution?s disclosure in its opening statement of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. ?I would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did? he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. ?I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. ? Mr. Roof who was then 21 continued: ?I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. ? As the government laid out its case for a death sentence the prosecutor who read from the journal Nathan S. Williams an assistant United States attorney told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roof?s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. ?The defendant didn?t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people? Mr. Williams said a few moments before he declared ?The death penalty is justified. ? Later aided by a slide show he described each of the victims and their lives setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trial?s sentencing phase which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15 after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes obstruction of religion resulting in death and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof now 22 to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roof?s flat   monotone during the guilt phase when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. ?The point is that I?m not going to lie to you not by myself or through somebody else? Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom several women on the right side which is reserved for victims? family members left their seats one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf and he did not   any of the prosecution?s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses including at least one survivor of the attack family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney the church?s slain pastor and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  ?   as a young saxophone player in a school band attending the births of their two daughters vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as ?a voice for the voiceless? to his work in the South Carolina Legislature where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. ?He was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry? Ms. Pinckney a school librarian said. ?He was that great catch. ? Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17 2015 as she and the couple?s younger daughter Malana then 6 listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband?s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. ?I was just like ?Shh shh shh? ? Ms. Pinckney said ?and I put my hand over her mouth and she was holding on to me and she put her hand on my mouth. ? ?Mama is Daddy going to die?? her daughter asked Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney Julius N. Richardson asked why she thought she had been spared. ?It wasn?t my time? Ms. Pinckney answered. ?I couldn?t see God taking both parents away from two small kids. ? The Rev. Kylon Middleton an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and perhaps the state?s first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor 49 Cynthia Hurd 54 Susie Jackson 87 Ethel Lee Lance 70 Tywanza Sanders 26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson 59. Near the end of the day Ms. Thompson?s widower the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here told jurors about their   marriage their anniversary date to a beach his wife?s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. ?She had her glow? he said. ?I mean this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. ? Word of a shooting came hours later and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. ?My whole world was gone? he said. ?I literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her and she was gone. What am I here for? If she?s gone what am I here for??
64,17356,In Turkey U.S. Hand Is Seen in Nearly Every Crisis - The New York Times,New York Times,Tim Arango,1/5/2017,2017,1,,ISTANBUL  ?   Turkish officials accused the United States of abetting a failed coup last summer. When the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated last month the Turkish press said the United States was behind the attack. And once again after a gunman walked into an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year?s Day and killed dozens the   news media pointed a finger at the United States. ?America Chief Suspect? one headline blared after the attack. On Twitter a Turkish lawmaker referring to the name of the nightclub wrote: ?Whoever the triggerman is Reina attack is an act of CIA. Period. ? Turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the Syrian civil war has spilled across the border. But the events have not pushed Turkey closer to its NATO allies. Conversely they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at Washington and moves closer to Moscow working with the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin to secure a   in Syria. One story in the Turkish press based on a routine travel warning issued by the American Embassy in Turkey was that the United States had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack which the Islamic State later claimed responsibility for. Another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the American military. Still another claimed the assault was a plot by the United States to sow divisions in Turkey between the secular and the religious. Rather than bringing the United States and Turkey together in the common fight against terrorism the nightclub attack even with the gunman still on the run appears to have only accelerated Turkey?s shift away from the West at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society. All of this is a reflection many critics say of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of Turkey?s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that instead of unifying to confront terrorism Turkish society is fracturing further with each attack. The West symbolized by the United States is the perennial bogeyman. While seeming to pile on the Obama administration in its waning days  ?   by accusing it of supporting Turkey?s enemies including the Islamic State Kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen whom Mr. Erdogan blamed for directing the coup  ?   Turkish officials are also telegraphing something else: that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the United States once   Donald J. Trump takes office. ?Our expectation from the new administration is to end this shame? Turkey?s prime minister Binali Yildirim said this week while accusing the United States of providing weapons to Kurdish militants in Syria who are fighting the Islamic State but are also an enemy of Turkey. ?We are not holding the new administration responsible for this? Mr. Yildirim said. ?Because this is the work of the Obama administration. ? Meanwhile the nightclub assailant is on the loose. The Turkish authorities said on Wednesday that they had identified the killer but refused to release any other details although photographs of the man from surveillance cameras have been released. Also a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in Istanbul?s Taksim Square. A senior United States official who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details said the Turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in Istanbul. The official said the Turks now believed the killer was from Uzbekistan not Kyrgyzstan as many reports this week had first suggested. The official expressed alarm at the growing   in Turkey which seems to accumulate after each crisis here and said it put the lives of Americans in the country in jeopardy. The chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on Istanbul?s streets with vehicle checkpoints night raids on houses and   helicopters. ?There is significant fear in ordinary people? said Aydin Engin a columnist at the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet who was detained last year as part of the government?s crackdown on the news media. ?Fear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place being in a crowd going to a shopping mall getting on the metro. ? With each passing day public life descends deeper into what many Turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life. In the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the Bosporus nationalists staged a mock execution of Santa Claus in the name of defending Islam a reporter for The Wall Street Journal was detained   and placed in solitary confinement  ?   for according to the newspaper?s account ?violating a government ban on publication of images from an Islamic State video? and a   fashion designer was beaten up at the Istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts. ?In a way it?s basically a breakdown of order? said Soli Ozel a Turkish columnist and academic seeking to explain the tumult in society. ?Everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it. ? Tugrul Eryilmaz another longtime Turkish journalist recalled the country?s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed and said ?I have never been in such a situation like today. ? He brought up the Spanish filmmaker Luis Buuel who was known for surreal and absurd themes. ?I feel like I am in his movies? he said. While Turkey faces a growing terrorism threat the country is also largely at war with itself with deep divisions along many lines  ?   religion class ethnicity  ?   that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis. Perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of Mr. Erdogan about half the country and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful. ?Turkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of Erdogan that instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped the   and   blocks in the country are blaming each other? said Soner Cagaptay a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ?This is why I am deeply worried about Turkey and the country?s ability to stymie further terror attacks. ? Parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup. The emergency grants Mr. Erdogan?s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention. Tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs on suspicion of having links to Mr. Gulen who now lives in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan on Wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on Sunday morning a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere often giving speeches daily. Mr. Erdogan an Islamist rejected criticism that his government in pushing an Islamist agenda had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious. Many on social media in the aftermath of the nightclub attack noted that the Turkish government?s religious authorities had denounced New Year?s celebrations as  . ?As the president of all 79 million citizens? Mr. Erdogan said ?it is my duty to protect everyone?s rights law and spaces of freedom. ? Mr. Erdogan who spoke this week with President Obama in a condolence call also told his audience what he believed Turkey in facing so many terrorist attacks was really up against: a plot by the West. Invoking the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I and the subsequent Turkish war against Western armies and their proxies he said ?Today Turkey is in a new struggle for independence. ?
65,17358,A New Casualty of Syria?s War: Drinking Water in Damascus - The New York Times,New York Times,Ben Hubbard,1/5/2017,2017,1,,BEIRUT Lebanon  ?   For millions of Damascus residents   concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes wash clothes or take a shower. For nearly two weeks the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find. ?When the world gets hard for us we work something out? said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a   cola bottle to wash teacups. ?When you cut off the water we dig for water. When you cut off the tap we make a tap. ? Like most of Syria?s problems the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war which has killed hundreds of thousands of people displaced about half the country?s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government armed rebels and jihadist groups. While a   brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country it has not stopped the fighting everywhere nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies as appears to be the case with Damascus?s water. Historically most of the water for the capital which is controlled by the government of President Bashar   has come from the Barada Valley north of the city which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22 when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva said by email Tuesday that the ?deliberate targeting of the water infrastructure? had caused the  . ?But we are not in a position to say by whom? he said. ?The area has been the scene of much fighting so we have not been able to access it. ? Now 5. 5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water which has raised the risk of waterborne disease especially among children he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the  . Antigovernment activists say that government forces and fighters from Lebanon?s Hezbollah organization have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and   forces. Turkey?s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the   saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana the capital of Kazakhstan on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about   of the city?s daily needs Mr. Laerke the spokesman said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A    shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands feet and faces an option not available to the women of the house. At home he said they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One    woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. ?My family?s dream is to get a warm shower? she said speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. ?It has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine. ? She expressed anger that Syria?s   news media had said little about the water crisis instead focusing on the military?s battles with rebels. ?We are fed up with the news of military operations? she said. ?We want news about water and water supply schedules. ? Despite the water crisis conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the   appears to be holding there the formerly   eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands United Nations relief officials said. ?Nothing prepared us for what we saw? Sajjad Malik the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. ?The infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood. ? Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food water shelter and medical care in the city where four million people once lived. He estimated that 1. 5 million people remain in Aleppo mostly on the western side including roughly 400 000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. ?They?re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods? Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that ?Aleppo?s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now. ?
66,17360,My Canada - The New York Times,New York Times,,1/11/2017,2017,1,,Canada our No. 1 pick for this year?s 52 Places to Go list spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes not just of people and locations but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that in lean years laid off everyone in her department except her. (More?s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime she shuttled between the province?s pulp and paper mills doing the job of six people negotiating contracts for hotels log loaders harvesters and more. One year when I was 25 I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns and who called her by her English name Matilda. We set out in her car exploring the    of Vancouver Island heading for the northern tip Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother?s terrible driving and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that in order to strengthen my moral fiber I should camp alone for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite work for a few days in Port Hardy and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island?s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl whose name translates to ?smoke of the world? was taken into ownership  ?   both private and national  ?   by gunpoint dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  ?   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  ?   has meant that much of the community?s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849 the Kwakiutl population was decimated but it survives. In 2013 British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl?s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom telling her I was afraid and asking her to come get me. That night we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working much like this one on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who worried about my mother entered her hotel room in the morning to find her gone. So peaceful they told us as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed jobs have been lost and as of a decade ago a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island?s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of ?Do Not Say We Have Nothing. ? Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill?s daughter Diana who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the ?prisoners? to fight oppression with noncooperation  ?   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake ?invasion? by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps? explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists another step on the ladder that they had climbed through trade unionism farmers? unions suffragism and feminism to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto Kingston and Ottawa who could rhyme the classic protest chant ?   ? with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the ?80s Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher?s Point the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting one part intense practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I?ve always been an early riser and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps I became active in the maintenance and management of the island volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  ?s board. When the  ?s finances crashed with the   recession we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  ?   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I?d made there and the dreams we?d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences I demand to know all the minutiae of the island?s upkeep which trees survived the winter storms and what color they?re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank Calif. now and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees I can almost pretend that I?ve brought her back to Grindstone the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family. Cory Doctorow is the author of the forthcoming novel ?Walkaway? and a special adviser to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful   turboprop relic of an airplane with metal everywhere you expect plastic made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker I flew north from Whitehorse Yukon?s capital city past 300 miles of moonscape  ?   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  ?   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town nicknamed ?Paris of the North? during the late   Gold Rush looked like a strange solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. ?If you leave your moose out the ravens will get at it? the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October and the black bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger   chunks of ice formed audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally one morning in November I woke to an eerie noticeable silence. I went down to the river?s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they?d heaved onto the shore their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover it wasn?t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out I could hear ice continuing to crack the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet I?d been told ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die I thought. Halfway across I stopped and looked south toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we?re a hardy people thriving in the inhospitable north. It?s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if like me  ?   like most  ?   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment my breath clouding around me icicles forming on my chin I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house hours later I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs like my cheeks and nose were a raw violent red. Out on the river I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. ?Just picking up my mail!? he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel ?For Today I Am a Boy? and the poetry collection ?How Festive the Ambulance. ?  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara which is where on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls they stayed and became Mama and Papa then Oma and Opa. My mother Linda was the fourth of Oma and Opa?s seven children born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me ?Sarah Nicole? while my father one of four from the suburbs has never said anything but ?Sarah. ? At home in London Ontario I sided with my dad thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm my name was turned by thick German tongues into ?   . ? This older extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane   in birches led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen we ate Oma?s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream maybe if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool the water cold and unchlorinated under scum colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they?re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil and we rolled our eyes but did it one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully read my aunt?s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like but I maintain that Opa?s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley in the Eastern Townships of Quebec because I liked what the bay?s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams above my head through the windows. I saw the wind too moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in I?d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I?d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Qubcois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town?s   barn and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War about Irish Catholics fleeing famine about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who?d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis how they named the lakes and rivers and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station my next stop and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn?t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind looking for ghosts mine and others? looking for my words my promised land my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how having been asked to stay in a small village I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I?m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple walnut beech oak birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning at the inn by the river a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot. lise Turcotte a poet and novelist is the author of ?The Sound of Living Things? and ?Guyana. ? Translated by Allison M. Charette. En franais: Il y a quelques annes on m?a demand de sjourner dans un petit village de mon choix afin d?y crire des pomes. J?ai choisi la valle de la Missisquoi dans les cantons de l?est en Qubec parce que j?aimais la signification du nom donn par les Premires Nations  la baie: beaucoup d?oiseaux aquatiques. Dj je voyais des oiseaux partout dans mes rves autour de ma tte derrire les fentres. Je voyais aussi le vent bouger  travers les champs de mas. Cette rgion me ramenait aussi  mon amour de la  . Afin de choisir le village de mon sjour j?avais point mon doigt sur un petit village appel Mystic. Ce nom m?attirait. J?avais aussi dcouvert une ville homonyme aux   o il y avait dans un muse une salle ddie  Melville. Je me laisse toujours guider par les concidences pour crire. J?inventais d?ores et dj des liens entre Melville et le Mystic qubcois entre moi prenant des notes dans une Cavalier loue et ces dfricheurs de territoires rels et fictifs que sont les grands crivains amricains du 19e sicle. J?imaginais aussi des histoires de diable tournant en rond dans la Grange  douze cts et crais une numrologie intime  moi. Je chercherais les ponts couverts sur la route les granges rondes construites par des quakers utopiques les maisons  faade victorienne je pensais  la fuite des loyalistes vers le nord aux Irlandais catholiques fuyant la famine  tous ces immigrants ayant laiss leurs traces sur le chemin. Je savais qu?en m?aventurant plus loin aux abords du grand lac Memphrmagog je penserais aussi aux dserteurs de la guerre du Vietnam. Je pensais aux Abnaquis des Premires Nations qui ont donn les noms aux lacs et aux rivires  notre ignorance.    l o mon sjour commenait j?ai compris cependant que j?tais sur une route o chaque arrt menait  un autre. Je suis entre dans le bureau du tourisme j?ai pos mille questions  une petite historienne de Stanbridge Station. Elle m?a indiqu sur la carte o se trouve Chemin   la deuxime plus belle route du Qubec. (Je n?ai pas jamais appris o se situe la premire). Et je ne suis pas reste  Mystic: ds que j?ai aperu le vieux cimetire de Hunter Mills c?est la zone frontalire entre le Qubec et les   qui m?a fascine. Elle tait l?illustration de l?tat dans lequel je me trouvais dans l?esprit de l?errance  la recherche de fantmes les miens ceux des autres  la recherche de mes mots ma terre promise ma maison construite pierre aprs pierre tout au long de ma vie. Et c?est ainsi qu?appele  sjourner dans un petit village je me suis retrouve  ramasser les grains d?un chapelet de hameaux disperss sur le chemin de la frontire. Le dcor que j?y ai trouv m?enchante toujours: villages enclavs dans l?ombre des montagnes dont le grandeur veillaient sur les lacs longs et les rivires fermes et champs de mas une Mercedes sur quatre blocs  travers le dbarras devant une maison  l?abandon de vieux cimetires   qui surprennent  chaque dtour des arbres feuillus rables noyers tres chnes bouleaux quelques croix de chemin d?anciennes gares et glises de vieux postes de frontire et le matin  l?auberge un petit chat noir perch sur une branche d?arbre coutant le bruit des chutes et de la cafetire qui ronronne.
67,17361,How We Put Together Our 52 Places to Go List - The New York Times,New York Times,,1/15/2017,2017,1,,For the 12th straight year the Travel section presents its annual Places to Go issue. You will likely have some questions: How did the No. 1 spot get there? Why is my favorite spot not on the list? What?s the deal with those 360 videos online at nytimes. ? Here are some frequently asked questions about how we chose our 52 Places to Go in 2017.  What made Canada the top choice? And why would you choose a country?  Canada has it all (O. K. maybe not tropical beaches). It?s a world unto itself with Vancouver Island surf breaks culinary delights in Toronto and Montreal and natural glories of parks like Banff in Alberta. And let?s face it clichs of Mounties and hockey aside Canada remains a terra incognita for Americans and much of the world. It?s a great time to correct that as the country celebrates its 150th anniversary this year (which means free admission all year to those national parks) and currently offers a generous exchange rate with the United States dollar. What is special about the list online? And in print? Look at the interactive version of the list on a computer or mobile device and you?ll notice a bunch of 360 videos that allow you to explore some of these places in a newly immersive way. ?Travel is a great match for 360 videos because the medium provides a vivid sense of place? said Maureen Towey the senior producer for 360 News at The New York Times. ?We ask our shooters to be adventurous in their camera placement. When they ask if they can rig the camera to a motorcycle a   balloon or a ski lift we say yes every time. ? On a computer you?ll also notice a stunning drone video shot in Tofino on the western coast of Vancouver Island. ?After many wet days there was one morning the clouds broke and the waves were a bit better? said Josh Haner a staff photographer who shot the footage. ?As my drone?s batteries were running out I looked to the right and a beautiful rainbow filled the beach. It was a spectacular 45 minutes. ? And print readers will notice something new as well: a special   presentation of the list that can be removed from the section and pored over (or hung on the wall). How do you start the process? We ask our regular contributors many of whom live overseas or roam the globe for ideas. We get hundreds of them. What are you looking for in those ideas? First why now? That is why is this the year to go to a particular place? We also aim for a geographic and thematic diversity. And we look for a mix of destinations both   and off the beaten path. (That means we often exclude the very obvious spots even though cities like London Berlin and Tokyo are always exciting they didn?t make this year?s list.) How do you narrow it down to the final list? A   meeting in which we discuss each idea. We get pretty punchy toward the end but are always happy with the final list. My favorite destination didn?t make the list. Why not? The 52 places we select are of course just the start. There are thousands of wonderful destinations to consider. We?d love to hear your suggestions  ?   use the #52Places2017 hashtag on Instagram to suggest yours.
68,17362,Places to Put Your Hands Together - The New York Times,New York Times,Shivani Vora,1/7/2017,2017,1,,Whether the music to your ears is pop classical jazz country or another type of tune altogether the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year the festival?s 50th but other genres such as   classic rock Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival June 16 to 18 in Monterey Calif. is also turning 50 this year and celebrating in style on the same weekend and at the same location  ?   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  ?   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians including Jimi Hendrix the Who and the Grateful Dead and this year over the course of three days nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo it?s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world?s top jazz players such as Manu Katch the drummer and singer the bassist Richard Bona and Ibrahim Maalouf the trumpet player all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Opra Garnier   an ornate   building but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1 at the Mustique Blues Festival a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil?s Bar where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees both famous and not giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year including the free and   Summer Night Concert Schnbrunn on May 25 in the Baroque gardens of Vienna?s Schnbrunn Palace and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30 most notably ?Aida? in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie a striking new building set atop a former warehouse with a glass facade a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year like the Viva Beethoven! series March 19 to 23 when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with ?Another Brick in the Wall? on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the city?s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd?s 1979 album ?The Wall. The band?s chief songwriter Roger Waters collaborated with Opra de Montral on the work which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love and it promises to be   and emotional just the way a captivating opera should be.
69,17363,Getting Around by Rail Sail or Foot - The New York Times,New York Times,Elaine Glusac,1/5/2017,2017,1,,Whether by train ship or   trail transit alternatives are poised to proliferate in 2017. Midyear the Brightline express train in South Florida is expected to open linking Miami and West Palm Beach. When it?s finished in 2019 travelers can make the trip between Miami and Orlando in three hours while driving takes four. The terminus at the new downtown MiamiCentral station will include a food hall known as Central Fare. In Switzerland the Gotthard Base Tunnel the world?s longest and deepest railway passage ceremonially opened last June but officially opened in December. Eventually the   tunnel through the Alps will cut 45 minutes off the trip between Zurich and Lugano. Offering more leisurely tours the luxury sleeper train Belmond Andean Explorer will begin in May linking Cusco in the Peruvian Andes to Lake Titicaca and Arequipa. The itinerary takes two nights but the company which also operates the   Belmond Hiram Bingham trains to Machu Picchu will offer   trips between Cusco and Lake Titicaca. Japan welcomed its newest   train Hokkaido Shinkansen last March traveling between Tokyo and the northern Hokkaido island in just over four hours. This spring the   Train Suite   will offer   luxury tours in sleeper cars that will travel from Tokyo to the Tohoku and Hokkaido regions. Among 2017 cruise ship launches in the mega class the   MSC Meraviglia from Europe?s MSC Cruises coming in the summer to the Mediterranean will be among the largest at sea with a   dome featuring light shows in the central promenade a   bowling alley and entertainment by Cirque du Soleil. In November the line will introduce another large ship the   MSC Seaside sailing   between Miami and the Caribbean. In March Celebrity Cruises plans to add two small ships to its fleet both sailing in the Galpagos Islands. The   Celebrity Xperience will offer trips lasting from seven to 13 nights providing snorkeling gear wet suits and binoculars to guests. A smaller craft the Celebrity Xploration will accommodate 16 guests. Lindblad Expeditions will introduce its first newly built ship the   National Geographic Quest in June in the Inside Passage of Alaska with kayaks paddle boards and landing craft for ventures into the wild. The   sailing ships of Star Clippers only look retro. The line?s newly built Flying Clipper making its debut late in 2017 will be powered by 32 sails and it can carry 300 passengers. The   luxury line Silversea will add the   Silver Muse in April in the Mediterranean. Highlights include larger and connecting suites for friends and family and eight restaurants including French Japanese and one that encourages diners to cook for themselves on heated lava stones. Among river launches Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection will begin the       Joie de Vivre in France in March. Crystal River Cruises will unveil the Crystal Bach on the Danube in June and the Crystal Mahler on the Rhine in August. Both will accommodate 106 guests and include butler service five restaurants and lounges and a spa. Crystal has also announced it will start Crystal AirCruise in 2017: private jet trips aboard its   Boeing  . The inaugural trip ($159 000 a person) circumnavigates the globe over 27 days beginning Aug. 31 via Peninsula Hotels. Canada aims to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its confederation by completing its transcontinental Great Trail a   or roughly   multiuse recreational trail linking Newfoundland in the east to British Columbia in the west with northern spurs to the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.
70,17364,5 Must-See Shows if You?re in New York This Month - The New York Times,New York Times,Charles Isherwood,1/25/2017,2017,1,,Broadway shows often fold their tents at the end of the year fearing the winter blues at the box office. But this year a few shows of note are holding on at least for a week or two. You?ve got a few more days to catch Stephen Karam?s gorgeous ?The Humans? last season?s Tony winner for best play (ending on Jan. 15) and even fewer to jump on the exhilarating emotional roller coaster that is the sublime revival of the musical ?Falsettos? (ending on Sunday). Looking further ahead here are other notable shows and events I?d put at the top of my    list. The first of the majestic   cycle of plays written by the great August Wilson this drama set in the 1970s (and written in 1979) was until now the only piece of the cycle not to be produced on Broadway. A classic Wilson ensemble drama about a group of gypsy cab drivers in the Hill District of Pittsburgh the new Manhattan Theater Club production is directed by Ruben   who has both appeared in and directed Wilson?s plays  ?   notably the superb recent revival of ?The Piano Lesson? from the Signature Theater. (In previews for a Jan. 19 opening at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.) Normally I frown on theater as a rarefied form of stargazing. But with a star as luminous as Cate Blanchett I will grant an exception. And of course Ms. Blanchett who graces this new adaptation of ?Platonov? an early Chekhov play is not merely a movie star burnishing her reputation with a Broadway debut. During the past decade she has made regular acclaimed appearances on the New York stage in productions imported from the Sydney Theater Company (as is this one). An unwieldy drama about the familiar Chekhovian concerns  ?   lives full of regret stomachs bloated with vodka  ?   the play has been moved from Russia in the 19th century to Russia in the late 20th century for this version by Andrew Upton Ms. Blanchett?s husband. The esteemed Australian actor Richard Roxburgh is Platonov. (In previews for a Sunday opening at the Barrymore Theater.) I have been saving this lovable classic as a cure for the   blues. The small but enterprising Irish Rep first produced this delicious musical whimsy with a glorious multihued score by Burton Lane and E. Y. Harburg a dozen years ago with Melissa Errico as the ingnue Sharon (she who wonders ?How Are Things in Glocca Morra? ?). The seemingly ageless Ms. Errico I am delighted to report is unfurling her silvery soprano once again in this revival directed by the company?s artistic director Charlotte Moore. (Through Jan. 29 at the Irish Repertory Theater.) [Read the review] This is not a single show (as downtown theatergoers will of course know) but a whole feast of international theater presented by the Public Theater at its home base and elsewhere. Along with P. S. 122?s Coil and other festivals it has come to make January a dizzying smorgasbord of experimental theater. Highlights this year include a new production from one of my favorite companies the imaginative 600 Highwaymen presenting ?The Fever? which is said to be ?performed in complete collaboration with the audience. ? Bring your tap shoes  ?   or at least a willingness to blast your way through the fourth wall on a regular basis. (Various locations  .) Martin McDonagh?s     was the first of his trilogy of plays set in the impoverished Irish village of the title. It returns in a   production from the Druid Theater the company that first made a splash internationally with a pungent production that ultimately moved to Broadway. Once again the company?s longtime chief Garry Hynes directs. And Marie Mullen who won a Tony Award as the embittered daughter of a manipulative terror of a mother with the aptly monstrous name Mag now takes on that formidable role.

71,17365,Remaking Kennedy Airport Is Governor?s Next Big Plan - The New York Times,New York Times,Patrick McGeehan,1/5/2017,2017,1,,Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Wednesday that with a complete overhaul of La Guardia Airport underway he wants to rebuild New York City?s other airport John F. Kennedy International. Mr. Cuomo outlined a plan to spend more than $10 billion modernizing Kennedy?s terminals and improving the highway and transit systems connected to the airport. He did not provide a timetable for the plan or say specifically where all of the money would come from. ?The next step is to tackle J. F. K. because La Guardia isn?t enough? Mr. Cuomo said speaking at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York a business group in Manhattan. ?We need to build a new airport at J. F. K. and go through the same process as we did with La Guardia. ? In promoting big infrastructure projects including the Second Avenue subway which opened Sunday Mr. Cuomo is building his legacy in New York and perhaps raising his national profile. The plans offered by Mr. Cuomo on Wednesday suggest that he does not intend to stop trying to impose his will on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which operates La Guardia and J. F. K. The authority?s commissioners are scheduled to meet on Thursday to vote on a $30 billion   spending plan that includes only about $1 billion for improvements at J. F. K. When Mr. Cuomo formed an advisory group in 2015 to study how to improve J. F. K. he said the panel would make recommendations to the authority. But the authority?s chairman John J. Degnan did not see the panel?s final report until Tuesday. ?We await an opportunity to review the details of the governor?s proposal? Mr. Degnan said on Wednesday. ?We will have to evaluate it against other compelling capital needs identified by the Port Authority both within other airports and within other operations that we oversee. ? Mr. Degnan an appointee of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey a Republican has been at odds with Mr. Cuomo a Democrat over the authority?s spending priorities. The agency also operates the main commuter bus terminal in Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport. Mr. Cuomo pushed for $2. 5 billion in the capital plan for improvements at the New York airports possibly including an AirTrain link from New York City?s subway system to La Guardia. Mr. Cuomo?s advisory panel suggested that most of the rest of the money  ?   up to $7 billion  ?   could come from private sources including airlines that use J. F. K. Kennedy is a collection of   terminals some of which were built at least in part by the airlines that occupy them. JetBlue Airways and the authority split the cost of building Terminal 5 which opened in 2008. Delta Air Lines has spent more than $1 billion in the recent years to improve its facilities at Terminals 2 and 4. At La Guardia the authority has committed $600 million to the rebuilding of Terminals C and D against an estimated cost of about $4 billion. That investment would come on top of a $4 billion rebuilding of the Central Terminal Building there which began last year. Mr. Cuomo hopes to entice airlines to make similar investments at J. F. K. to compete for customers. He challenged airlines to make offers saying Delta had called him at 5:45 a. m. on Wednesday. Mr. Cuomo did not mention seeking federal financing.   Donald J. Trump has said he plans to make an ambitious investment in infrastructure a priority of his administration. As part of Mr. Cuomo?s plan for J. F. K. Matthew Driscoll New York State?s transportation commissioner said his agency would spend as much as $2 billion to improve the flow of traffic to and from the airport. The changes would include adding a lane to the Van Wyck Expressway and widening ramps at the busy interchange in Kew Gardens Queens which Mr. Driscoll said handles 250 000 vehicles per day. Thomas F. Prendergast chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that transit agencies would explore creating a   ride between Manhattan and J. F. K. Travelers must now switch to the AirTrain from the subway or Long Island Rail Road a transfer that Mr. Prendergast described as ?schlepping with your luggage. ? Though New York City owns the land under J. F. K. no one from City Hall attended Mr. Cuomo?s speech. ?Investments in New York City?s airports are vitally important to our region?s   development? said Melissa Grace a spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio. ?We look forward to hearing more details about the plans for J. F. K. in the months to come. ?
72,17366,Cyberwar for Sale - The New York Times,New York Times,Mattathias Schwartz,1/22/2017,2017,1,,On the morning of May 18 2014 Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox. It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico?s   Partido Accin Nacional or PAN and Lagunes a former federal congresswoman was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city. The emails seemed harmless at least at first. One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague. It asked her to download and review a document. Lagunes clicked on the link but it seemed to be broken so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again. Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account. Meanwhile she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes?s account that she did not remember sending. Now Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o?clock she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. ?I did not send you an email? he insisted. A consultant with the campaign  ?   who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates  ?   overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign he realized had been hacked. In the vote for party leader Lagunes and her allies in Puebla  ?   a   drive southeast from Mexico City  ?   were supporting the challenger a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla?s powerful governor Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico?s rising political stars Moreno Valle is close to Mexico?s president Enrique Pea Nieto and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto?s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional or PRI long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010 Moreno Valle?s opponents say his ambitions have grown and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state  ?   including members of his own party  ?   under control. ?In the beginning the governor was   and respectful? Rafael Micalco a former leader of PAN in Puebla state told me. ?When he became governor he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats. ? This race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico?s presidency in 2018. (This past September Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla where backers of the challenger Ernesto Cordero claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent Gustavo Madero though the governor?s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election Madero?s campaign manager said that Cordero?s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. ?Their strategy is clear from the outset? he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. ??u2009?If I win good. If not I was cheated. ??u2009? After Lagunes?s call on Election Day her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed ?the bunker. ? All morning they had been trying to reach their field network a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers the team concluded must have found the list of the canvassers? names and phone numbers  ?   widely circulated by email within the campaign  ?   and begun to intimidate them. ?The day before? the consultant told me the field network was ?motivated and eager to do this work. After the hack it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out they or their families would get hurt. ? According to another worker on Cordero?s campaign who also requested anonymity citing fear of reprisal the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: ?We know who you are. If you don?t want any trouble shut down your cellphone and stop your activity. ? The worker added: ?It?s an authoritarian regime. ? Madero won the election with 57 percent of the 162 792 votes cast over all. In Puebla his margin was substantially larger roughly 74 percent. Cordero?s team decided not to contest the result. They had suspicions about how they were hacked. But it would be another year before any evidence emerged. Their political enemies leaked documents seemed to show had built a spying operation using software made by an Italian firm called Hacking Team  ?   just one of many private companies that largely below public notice have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens. The industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror. But in many countries around the world these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage. On average an American office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day a number that grows with each passing year. The ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a   record of our    lives rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details stored in a perpetual archive accessible from anywhere on earth and protected in some cases by nothing more than a single password. In the case of Violeta Lagunes her email login represented a point of vulnerability a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment  ?   specifically whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake. Nearly two years later John Podesta chairman of Hillary Clinton?s campaign was faced with a similar judgment call. An email warned him that someone in Ukraine had tried to access his Gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password. His senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaign?s technology experts. ?This is a legitimate email? he replied in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part he meant to say it was not legitimate. ?The gmail one is REAL? the senior adviser wrote to Podesta and another aide. And so like Lagunes Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as ?spear phishing. ? It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time against one target. After that attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter invoices   bills and confidential memos it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts  ?   Twitter Facebook Amazon  ?   and even access to company servers and internet domains. The Podesta and Lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution. The 2009 ?Climategate? incident which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a British university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords. The 2014 hack of internal Sony files which American officials attributed to the North Korean government began with a series of   emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into Sony?s servers. Each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization: their blunt insults their quashed dissents their   plans their smarmy flattery all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked ?send. ? In an earlier era the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior like bribery or burglary. Now in many cases all they had to do was send along a link. The White House C. I. A. and F. B. I. have all claimed that based on classified evidence they can trace the hacks of Podesta?s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A   website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling   ethical malware including   Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms surveillance software is subject to few trade controls a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a   pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. ?The technology is morally neutral? says Joel Brenner a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. ?The same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah   to keep track of whomever they don?t like. ? Hacking Team has fewer than 50 employees but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents its espionage tool which is called the Remote Control System or R. C. S. can be licensed for as little as $200 000 a year  ?   well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target?s computer or phone the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages emails phone and Skype calls location data and so on. Whereas the N. S. A. ?s   programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables the R. C. S. acquires it at the source right off a target?s device before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible digitized equivalent of a    . The United States government is almost certainly the world?s most formidable repository of hacking talent but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why according to company documents at least two federal   agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F. B. I. beginning in 2011 and the Drug Enforcement Administration beginning in 2012. The F. B. I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700 000 the D. E. A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia. Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world?s most repressive governments. Some like those of Honduras Ethiopia Bahrain Morocco Egypt and Saudi Arabia are Western allies. Other countries like Uzbekistan and Turkey have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014 Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan a United   state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable in light of recent events is the   relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F. S. B. one of Russia?s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla Hacking Team used a middleman a research agency called Kvant to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014 the agency paid Hacking Team 451 000 euros to license the Remote Control System. Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit ?gross   abuses? and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case David Vincenzetti Hacking Team?s founder and chief executive told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. ?We sell to official governmental LEAs?  ?     agencies  ?   ?and security agencies ONLY? Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. ?If one sells sandwiches to Sudan he is not subject as far as my knowledge goes to the law? one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. ?Hacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor. ? When asked about its arrangements in various countries the company responded that it ?does not comment on confidential business dealings. ? Its American spokesman Eric Rabe did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships Rabe wrote ended in 2014 Russia because ?the Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime? and Sudan ?because of concerns about the country?s ability to use the system in accordance with the H. T. contract. ?) Separately the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was in fact a former client. Until recently most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation. Industry players kept a low profile operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows. This is why it was so notable when in July 2015 an unusual tweet appeared in Hacking Team?s Twitter feed. ?Since we have nothing to hide? it read ?we?re publishing all our emails files and source code. ? Then came another tweet with links to a downloadable file called Hacked Team. The file was huge 420 gigabytes of material scraped from Hacking Team?s internal servers. Inside were 33 folders containing the company?s contracts payroll documents invoices legal memos   records and a   cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down. Hacking Team had itself been hacked. WikiLeaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database. Anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling ?the evilest technology on earth. ? You could browse Hacking Team?s source code including one line using ?bomb_blueprints. pdf? as a placeholder for files that might be found on a target?s device. On Reddit an online peanut gallery formed around the   online habits of one Hacking Team engineer and his own notably weak passwords  ?   HTPassword! P4ssword Passw0rd. But the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were Hacking Team?s client list and the names of some of the clients? targets. In South Korea newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that Hacking Team?s software had helped the nation?s intelligence service rig an election after the leak one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide. In Ecuador a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the R. C. S. Three belonged to lawmakers a fourth to the mayor of Quito all four were members of the opposition party. With the source code for the Remote Control System now public the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year though Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe the American spokesman sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former   anchor he exudes   credibility. ?If you disagree with someone on the internet? he said of the Hacked Team files with a wave of his hand ?there?s no need to have a   debate. Just go destroy them. ? A couple of months later I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team?s headquarters a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company?s software were Rabe Philippe Vinci a company vice president and Alessandro Scarafile a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop which represented the console of a client intelligence agency was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target?s computer: images from   cameras sound from   mikes screenshots detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude and logs of address books calendars phone calls Skype calls and passwords as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views called ?line of events? and ?line of actions? assembled the information into chronological order. Scarafile who was playing both the customer and the target or ?bad guy? turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania. There are three methods Scarafile explained for getting the Remote Control System onto a target?s device. Customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a USB stick or memory card. They can beam the R. C. S. in over a   network. Or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment  ?   usually a file from a   program like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Scarafile did not mention a fourth method one described by Hacking Team?s critics and referred to in its internal emails: the installation of the R. C. S. through a more elaborate process called ?network injection? which is said to involve pinpointing the target?s exact location on the internet observing the person as he orders up say a YouTube cat video and then serving up a doctored version of the same page one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground  ?   YouTube logo and all  ?   as the R. C. S. discreetly rolls in past the digital gates. Whatever the method of infection the malicious code known as an ?agent? then communicates with its masters anonymously its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team?s product to spy on him. For the demo Scarafile opted for the third method which he referred to as ?a bit of social engineering. ? Using the customer?s computer he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target?s computer and   on it just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. ?From now on? he said ?this system is currently infected or monitored by the Remote Control System. ? It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out. On the timeline the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt named ?Jimmy Page . .. head of the terrorist cell. ? Using Jimmy Page?s Dell Scarafile logged into Page?s Gmail Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype perused Page?s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone Harry Potter Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page?s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to ?kill David Vincenzetti. ? R. C. S. captured it all including periodic snapshots of Scarafile as Page at work. ?I don?t like the words ?inject? and ?infect??u2009? Vinci the vice president said. ?R. C. S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls right?? Rabe had told me that Vincenzetti was ?a fighter? and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk  ?   a sort of mood board like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand. Vincenzetti?s mood board though wasn?t about sneakers or cola. It was about the global struggle for power which he seemed to envision as one big conflict a battle between the good guys and the bad guys. On the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring Navy SEALs can ring should they want to quit the program during Hell Week and a quote from another entrepreneur that ?business is war. ? On the bad side Vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension the artificial islands rising in the South China Sea a line of terrestrial pawns advancing China?s sphere of influence. Beside it was a chart about Iran depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent   deal. ?I think the Iran deal is just terrible? Vincenzetti said and then added sarcastically ?Oh it?s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful. ? ?That is not an official company position? Rabe interjected. Vincenzetti now 48 is a familiar type  ?   a ferociously competitive driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife who was born in Morocco and no children. His small   eyes can make him seem sleepily blas. On the morning we met at Hacking Team?s offices he wore jeans a   cardigan and a striped shirt unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table considering in turn the espresso machine the view from the window a case of bottled water. ?If I wanted to break into this room how would I do it?? he asked. ?There is a door and there are two windows. ? He pressed his hands against the glass panes. ?The perimeter is the first thing you must secure? he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. ?If you cannot break into a bank you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively. ? In the   Vincenzetti?s parents a salesman and a schoolteacher bought him a Commodore 64 one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a   clone a Tron   game and a   adventure game. As a   student at the University of Milan in the ?90s he became fascinated by cryptography he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year he was appointed to administer the university?s internal network a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when ?everything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers and I was a hacker. ? Vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003 he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other   criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with   vendors part of an emerging arms race over   encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore Hacking Team?s first   client signed on in 2008. The company?s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011 a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring. By then Hacking Team had entered a growth phase its business driven in part by demand among   governments for   surveillance tools. According to two former employees the company held talks with Col. Muammar  ?s chief security officer who wanted to build a countrywide   scheme that could be embedded in every Libyan cellphone. (Rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred and added: ?The company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell. ?) The United Nations which prohibits the export of ?electronic weaponry? to Sudan has investigated Hacking Team?s activities there. Nineteen members of the Italian Parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the Egyptian government might have used the R. C. S. to track Giulio Regeni a    Italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in Egypt last year. Hacking Team?s software has not been connected to the case but the company has done business with the current Egyptian regime. As part of the controversy the Italian government temporarily revoked Hacking Team?s global export license so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the European Union. (When I brought up the Regeni case with Rabe he called the dead student ?this Italian national who got himself killed in Egypt. ? He cited Hacking Team?s official policy  ?   the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target. ?There is no evidence that Hacking Team?s software had anything to do with Regeni?s demise? Rabe said.) All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and   groups looking for ?objective evidence or credible concerns? that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team?s own interactions with customers leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with   content including polling data party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking Hacking Team   members simply emailed them back as requested with an embedded ?exploit? turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases Rabe replied that customers ?are not supposed to be using it for political purposes but I don?t think it?s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer? i. e. a support technician ?would have seen these files and known what was going on. . .. I think that?s a stretch that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident. ? Hacking Team?s most persistent critic is Citizen Lab a research group at the University of Toronto?s Munk School of Global Affairs. Before the Hacked Team leak Citizen Lab documented cases in which Hacking Team software turned up on the devices of activists in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates as well as an   journalist in Alexandria Va. Ronald Deibert Citizen Lab?s director told me that Hacking Team ?is a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products. ? When I asked Vincenzetti about this he said that Citizen Lab was motivated by money noting that the group won a   grant a week after publishing a report on Hacking Team?s sales to Ethiopia. ?Their identity? he said ?is: ?I am the defender of free speech I am the defender of liberty and democracy.? O. K. So am I. So is every rational guy. ? If Citizen Lab really cared about good and evil he said it would be fighting China and Iran. Almost immediately after the Hacked Team documents went online they were being pored over by R3D a Mexico     group. Luis Fernando Garca R3D?s director says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under Pea Nieto?s presidency and he took notice when Citizen Lab in 2014 released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with Hacking Team that routed data through Hong Kong London Amsterdam and Atlanta before terminating somewhere inside Mexico. Exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time but now R3D?s team recognized that this could be their chance to find out. Shortly thereafter R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government  ?   that of Jalisco on the Pacific Coast  ?   had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states including Puebla though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system which it claimed was for its prosecutor?s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press except in Puebla after R3D connected with Lado B a small   collective there. The site?s name translates to ?B Side? as in the back of a hit single  ?   symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold. Lado B?s editor Ernesto Aroche was not surprised that Puebla?s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle?s six years as governor there he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems including multiple ?security arches?   structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and   and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013 Aroche began noticing solicitations on the   website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a   request about them the government?s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled but Aroche was skeptical given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle?s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic   of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims? laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist Fernando Maldonado received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians. As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team?s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account  ?   soporteuiamx@gmail. com  ?   that also appears in many of Hacking Team?s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client?s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor. Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. ?Before we had been talking about ghosts? Aroche told me. ?Now we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors. ? More than a year later there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from P
73,17367,Why Men Don?t Want the Jobs Done Mostly by Women - The New York Times,New York Times,Claire Cain Miller,1/5/2017,2017,1,,It hasn?t been a great time to be a man without a job. The jobs that have been disappearing like machine operator are predominantly those that men do. The occupations that are growing like health aide employ mostly women. One solution is for the men who have lost jobs in factories to become health aides. But while more than a fifth of American men aren?t working they aren?t running to these new   jobs. Why? They require very different skills and pay a lot less. They?re also seen as women?s work which has always been devalued in the American labor market. The two occupations predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to decline most quickly from 2014 to 2024 are locomotive firers shrinking 70 percent and vehicle electronics installers and repairers down 50 percent. They are 96 percent and 98 percent male. Of the   jobs many are various types of health aides which are about 90 percent female. When men take these     jobs they have more job security and wage growth than in   work according to recent research. But they are paid less and feel stigmatized. ?The jobs being created are very different than the jobs being eliminated? said David Autor an economist at M. I. T. ?I?m not worried about whether there will be jobs. I?m very worried about whether there will be jobs for   adults especially the males who seem very reluctant to take the new jobs. ? Take Tracy Dawson 53 a welder in St. Clair Mo. He lost several jobs some because his employers took the work to China and Mexico and others because the workers were replaced by robots. He has heard the promises of   jobs in the health care field: His daughter trained to be a medical technician. But he never considered it. ?I ain?t gonna be a nurse I don?t have the tolerance for people? he said. ?I don?t want it to sound bad but I?ve always seen a woman in the position of a nurse or some kind of health care worker. I see it as more of a woman?s touch. ? Also health aides earn a median wage of $10. 50 an hour. Mr. Dawson used to earn $18 an hour making railroad traction motors. ?I was a welder  ?   that?s all I know how to do? said Mr. Dawson who is living on disability insurance because he has rheumatoid arthritis. Women were hit harder than men by the decline in   jobs according to Mr. Autor. But they have more easily moved into the expanding occupations and earn more college degrees than men. Women have always entered   fields  ?   usually   professional ones  ?   more than men enter   ones. There are now many female lawyers but male nurses are still rare. One reason is that jobs done by women especially caregiving jobs have always had lower pay and lower status. Yet when men especially white men enter   fields they are paid more and promoted faster than women a phenomenon known as the glass escalator. Much of men?s resistance to   jobs is tied up in the culture of masculinity say people who study the issue. Women are assumed to be empathetic and caring men are supposed to be strong tough and able to support a family. ?Traditional masculinity is standing in the way of   men?s employment and I think it?s a problem? said Andrew Cherlin a sociologist and public policy professor at Johns Hopkins and author of ?Labor?s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the   Family in America. ? ?We have a cultural lag where our views of masculinity have not caught up to the change in the job market? he said. But telling   men to take feminine jobs plays to their anxieties and comes off as condescending said Joan Williams a law professor at U. C. Hastings and author of ?Reshaping the   Debate: Why Men and Class Matter. ? ?White   men?s wages have plummeted and what happens to men in that context is anxieties about whether they?re ?real men? ? she said. It?s no surprise then that Donald J. Trump appealed to men who feel this way  ?   not just his promises to bring back factory jobs but also his machismo. Many unemployed men who did manual labor say they can?t take the time and make the effort to train for a new career because they have bills to pay. And they say they chose their original careers because they wanted to build things not take care of people. Lawrence Katz an economist at Harvard has a term for this: ?retrospective wait unemployment? or ?looking for the job you used to have. ? ?It?s not a skill mismatch but an identity mismatch? he said. ?It?s not that they couldn?t become a health worker it?s that people have backward views of what their identity is. ? Jon Ray 31 of Inez Ky. was an electrician at a coal mine until it was shuttered a year ago. He applied unsuccessfully for maintenance and repair jobs and got a job in manufacturing after enrolling in a program to learn how to operate computerized tools.   jobs weren?t an option he said. ?I couldn?t afford to go back to school? he said. ?And I?m used to working with my hands. ? If more men do   jobs they could erase the stigma and turn them into men?s jobs said Janette Dill a sociologist at the University of Akron at least for jobs that require less   caregiving. ?More men will go into care because they don?t have a choice but they?re going to carve out spaces for themselves that feel less like women?s work? she said. Ms. Dill was a   of a study published in April that looked at what happens when men move into   jobs in the health care field. Men in the   health jobs like the nursing assistants who change patients? sheets and help them bathe earned 10 percent less than men in   jobs. But they were less likely to be laid off and their wages rose over time while   wages were stagnant. Technical health care jobs like ultrasound technician  ?   requiring more training but not a college degree  ?   paid 22 percent more than other   jobs after controlling for things like education. They involve less interaction with patients and more with computers so they are less stereotypically feminine. There is an education and race divide among the men who take these jobs the study found. Black men were 3. 3 times as likely as white men to take the   health jobs and other minority men were 1. 8 times as likely. White men were more likely to take the   technical jobs. For men without college degrees more technical training that equips them for those jobs could help. And if health aide jobs paid more and offered better benefits they?d probably attract more men. Some hospitals are trying to make caregiving jobs seem manly  ?   like with a recruitment poster comparing the ?adrenaline rush? of being an operating room nurse to mountain climbing. Perhaps then men could take the same pride in their work that Mr. Dawson the unemployed welder showed when he talked about making pilings for the rebuilt World Trade Center. ?I had a good life as a welder? he said. ?It always amused me. That?s one reason I picked the job. ?
74,17368,Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China - The New York Times,New York Times,Katie Benner and Sui-Lee Wee,1/5/2017,2017,1,,Apple complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times?s websites in 2012 after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao who was then prime minister but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the   app. Apple removed both the   and   apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal were still available in the app store. ?For some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations? Fred Sainz an Apple spokesman said of the Times apps. ?As a result the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China. ? Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated who had contacted Apple and when and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented. China?s main internet regulator the Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to faxed questions. The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York Eileen Murphy said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision. ?The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world? Ms. Murphy said in a statement. The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services. The regulations say apps cannot ?engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. ? The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish ?prohibited? information. The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world?s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of ?harmful information? online and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable. Apple has previously removed other less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them. Apple?s chief executive Timothy D. Cook has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end the government was able to unlock the device without Apple??s help and the case was dropped. Farzana Aslam associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong noted that in matters involving customer privacy Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas search warrants or other legal documents. ?Maybe in the end they have to do it but I think there?s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China to show that actually there is this tension there? Ms. Aslam said. ?It?s not as simple as ?Because we operate in your jurisdiction we?ll do anything you ask of us. ?? She added that it was ?very worrying? that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government?s requests. In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them posted online on Dec. 29 revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the world?s biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apple?s largest iPhone markets though sales in that region have slowed. On Dec. 23 David Barboza a Times reporter spoke with members of Apple?s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting. Later that day a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed Ms. Murphy said. In another article published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog The Times described an   internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices. The Times news apps remain available in Apple?s app stores for other countries as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China. When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012 it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content. But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government?s firewall. And in July 2015 The Times released a new version of its   app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles one that the government appeared unable to stop. Apple?s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region?s app store. The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspaper?s computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation. Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April Apple?s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country just six months after they were introduced there. Mark Natkin the   managing director of Marbridge Consulting who advises American technology firms in China said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could ?ever fully comprehend how challenging it?s going to be. ? Mr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that ?the technology gap has started to close. ?
75,17369,Fed Officials See Faster Economic Growth Under Trump but No Boom - The New York Times,New York Times,Binyamin Appelbaum,1/5/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. Trump?s election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised according to an account of the Fed?s most recent meeting in  . That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates. For now however Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next the account said. ?While the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline? Michael Gapen chief United States economist at Barclays wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. ?Any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy. ? At the December meeting the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008 citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment. The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year but the account published on Wednesday  ?   after a standard   delay  ?   described the final decision as uncontroversial. Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy including tax cuts and spending increases reductions in regulation and restrictions on trade and immigration. As a result the account said Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth. ?The job of conducting U. S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months? said James Marple senior economist at TD Bank referring to the increased uncertainty. The Fed led by Janet L. Yellen the chairwoman predicted in December that it would raise rates three times this year. The account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress. ?Participants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply? the minutes said. The Fed?s   committee the Federal Open Market Committee has 17 members 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy. The Fed?s caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth. The economy is expanding at roughly the pace Fed officials regard as sustainable. The work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire and productivity is rising slowly. Two percent growth may be about as good as it gets. Ms. Yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus like a tax cut or a spending increase could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term resulting in increased inflation. The Fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly. Instead of acting   the Fed is choosing to wait for more information. But the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty. They want to be clear that the Fed?s prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth. Faster growth will mean faster increases. The account said Fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating seeing ?only a modest risk? of a ?sharp acceleration in prices. ? By holding rates at low levels the Fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and   higher rates reduce the stimulative effect. The benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent still very low by historical standards. ?Consumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month or even about additional rate increases in 2017? said Alan MacEachin chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. He noted that the last rate hike would add $1 to the monthly payment on a $5 000 credit card balance. The economic forecast prepared by the Fed?s staff for the December meeting anticipated that Mr. Trump?s election would result in ?slightly higher? growth over the next several years. It said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be ?substantially counterbalanced? by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar which would reduce exports of American goods and services. Several Fed officials reported that Mr. Trump?s election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts. ?Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending tax and regulatory policies? the minutes said. The minutes also noted however that some executives were concerned about the negative impact of proposed policy changes. In a recent interview John Williams president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said many executives in his district which encompasses the western United States worried about the potential impact of restrictions on immigration and on foreign trade both of which have been important drivers of regional growth. Businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers the minutes said. The unemployment rate fell to just 4. 6 percent in November. The lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus.
76,17370,Rockefeller Foundation Picks Rajiv J. Shah a Trustee as President - The New York Times,New York Times,David Gelles,1/10/2017,2017,1,,Rajiv J. Shah a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation was asked about six months ago to join the committee that would select the foundation?s next president. He said no. Instead Mr. Shah who until recently had been the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development ultimately said he wanted to be considered for the post. He got the job. On Thursday the Rockefeller Foundation one of the country?s largest and most influential philanthropies will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin who has been president for 12 years. The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $200 million each year and corrals governments companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem. Mr. Shah 43 will be the first   to lead the Rockefeller Foundation which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees. Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $17 billion in today?s dollars. Its first grant was to the American Red Cross and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world. In recent years the foundation has focused on the themes of ?resilience? and ?inclusive economies. ? That has resulted in programs aimed at establishing ?resilience officers? in 100 cities to focus on disaster relief and a plan that is sending 100 000   students to see the musical ?Hamilton. ? These efforts have struck critics as public relations stunts more than meaningful agents of change. And Ms. Rodin has drawn fire for spending too much time with corporate partners and not enough time with the recipients of grants. Much of the foundation?s work concerns improving health and   in Africa aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change. It was these diverse causes that attracted Mr. Shah to the job. With advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the University of Pennsylvania Mr. Shah worked at the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation for nearly a decade rising to be director for agricultural development. From 2009 to 2015 he ran U. S. A. I. D. leading the response to disasters including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. After leaving the agency he founded Latitude Capital a private equity firm focused on emerging markets. In those roles Mr. Shah said he came to understand the power of   partnerships a strategy that Ms. Rodin has embraced at the Rockefeller Foundation. ?I?ve seen what?s possible when people come together? he said in an interview this week. ?We were able to save tens of thousands if not millions of lives. ? Ms. Rodin was not involved in the search for her successor but has known Mr. Shah for years. They worked together on an agricultural project when he was at the Gates Foundation and he joined the Rockefeller Foundation board in 2015. ?He?s a marvel? Ms. Rodin said in an interview this week. ?He?s very strategic and very innovative. He shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years. ? Ms. Rodin said she believed that Mr. Shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at U. S. A. I. D. which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments organizations and companies. ?One of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at Rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships? Ms. Rodin said. ?We see in Raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this and has the capacity to be a great partner. ? Richard Parsons the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board said Mr. Shah was the unanimous choice of the search committee after a competitive process that considered hundreds of candidates. ?Raj is the perfect guy to come in after her? Mr. Parsons said in an interview. ?He?s a performer. You put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed. Now he?s got a platform. ? Mr. Shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies. ?That core concept of resilience is extraordinarily important going forward? he said. ?It gives us the opportunity to evolve into the future. ? But he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the American electorate in this divisive political moment. ?It is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago? he said. ?We live in a more fractured world. ? The Rockefeller Foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent. During Ms. Rodin?s tenure the foundation donated money to the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Shah is close with President Obama but said he maintained good relations with Republicans in the House and Senate and believed that the foundation?s core mission had bipartisan appeal. ?It?s widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest? Mr. Shah said. ?I have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale. ? He will now have a $200 million a year to try to deliver those results.
77,17371,Philippines Jailbreak Frees More Than 150 Inmates Prompting Manhunt - The New York Times,New York Times,Felipe Villamor,1/5/2017,2017,1,,MANILA  ?   A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight. One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the   southern island of Mindanao according to Peter Bungat the warden. The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao which is home to a   insurgency. Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility the North Cotabato District Jail were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers Senior Inspector Xavier Solda a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology told a radio station in Manila. A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates the police said. Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday when the jail?s power supply was cut. Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing. ?It was well planned? Mr. Bungat said. He said it was unclear whether any ?high profile? inmates were among the escapees. At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking according to officials from the jail management bureau. Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front the Philippines? largest rebel group. Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization which has signed a peace deal with the government. Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. A spokesman for that group Abu Misry denied any involvement in the jailbreak. Ernesto Abella a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte said there was no ?specific information? as to the identities of the gunmen ?though speculation is rife. ? Three inmates who had been charged with possessing drugs and explosives escaped from the North Cotabato District Jail last August. Eight years ago three inmates accused of carrying out a bombing also escaped from the jail.
78,17373,Enough With the Tweets China?s State Media Tells Trump - The New York Times,New York Times,Chris Buckley,1/5/2017,2017,1,,BEIJING  ?   China?s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark jibes and condemnation on Twitter: They banned access to it at home. Yet China has become the country that   Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his    Twitter feed. In bursts of 140 characters or less he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan trade the South China Sea and most recently North Korea. ?China has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade but won?t help with North Korea. Nice!? Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump?s sarcasm  ?   ?Nice!?  ?   could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the   way behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes. Xinhua the state news agency has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. ?An obsession with ?Twitter foreign policy? is undesirable? read the headline of  a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump?s posts. ?Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn?t child?s play and even less is it like doing business deals? said the article published after Mr. Trump?s latest barbed comments on China. ?Twitter shouldn?t become an instrument of foreign policy? the article said. Earlier that day a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump?s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea. But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump?s designated press secretary Sean Spicer has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse punchy format after he settles in the White House. ?Issuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump? Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump it said appeared to assume that ?issuing   comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. ? Mr. Xi is most unlikely to joust directly with Mr. Trump on Twitter. The service has been banned in China since 2009 though residents find ways to poke through the firewall of censorship. And while Chinese politicians love slogans they prefer to communicate with foreign leaders through long tranquilizing disquisitions. Open sarcasm is rare. Sad!
79,17374,Coming to Carnival Cruises: A Wearable Medallion That Records Your Every Whim - The New York Times,New York Times,Brooks Barnes,1/4/2017,2017,1,,DORAL Fla.  ?   Inside a clandestine Carnival Corporation complex here two former Disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul. Their mission: Take lessons learned at Walt Disney World where they helped bring about a $1 billion vacation management system involving   bracelets that link to personal information and apply them to cruises. The result: Millions of passengers on Carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails. ?As long as bigger newer cooler ships have kept coming the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities  ?   standing in long lines having a frustrating embarkation experience  ?   as acceptable? said John Padgett who joined Carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at Disney. ?That thinking stops now. ? Carnival which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on Thursday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In a keynote speech Arnold W. Donald Carnival?s chief executive intends to announce that the system  ?   an app called Ocean Compass paired with a     smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry  ?   will arrive on the company?s Princess Cruises fleet this year. Mr. Donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology (code name: Trident) to other Carnival brands. But he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority. ?The cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and over time more than that? Mr. Donald said. ?People want the world to be organized around them. On vacation even more so. ? Analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways including allowing Carnival to charge more for tickets particularly on older ships. Ease of purchase is another big component  ?   cruisers will be able to pay for food drinks and merchandise simply by having their credit   Ocean Medallion in their pocket. Carnival?s disks each   with the guest?s name will also power a new shipwide gambling platform. And Carnival gift shops will be stocked with a wide array of jewelry clips and key chains that passengers can buy to carry and display their disks. Carnival?s top rival Royal Caribbean Cruises already offers smartbands on   ships like the Anthem of the Seas. Called WOW bands they serve as room keys allow for wireless payment and make it faster and easier to embark and disembark. But Carnival says that its offering takes such systems much further in part because its technology is designed to be invisible. Unlike with smartbands there is no need to tap a sensor on a stateroom door for entry simply approaching the correct room with the Ocean Medallion in your pocket will unlock the door. Among the medallion system?s other offerings is a navigation tool designed to help family members find one another on the   ships. Under Mr. Donald who took over Carnival in   after a string of ship debacles the company has boomed. In the most recent quarter Carnival had a record $1. 4 billion in net income a 17 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. But he remains under pressure to recruit new customers. About 24. 2 million people worldwide took a cruise in 2016 according to the Cruise Lines International Association. That sounds like a lot but ?cruise vacations only represent about 2 percent of all vacations? said David Beckel an analyst at Bernstein Research. ?Because there is such a low penetration rate any increase in penetration  ?   even a minor minor one  ?   represents a big difference and hence the effort to improve the customer experience? Mr. Beckel said. As part of its Ocean Medallion plan Carnival has turned to television paying to produce three travel shows designed to make cruising look fun and easy. The shows has been broadcast on weekends in recent months on ABC NBC and the CW. In one   episode of ?The Voyager with Josh Garcia? the host is seen chatting with artists in Puerto Rico about making masks from coconuts. Carnival plans to produce at least 80 episodes in total. Analysts have praised the effort. ?People have a lot of preconceived notions about cruising that largely aren?t true? said Robin M. Farley an analyst for UBS. The system that Carnival plans to introduce on Thursday still has a lot to prove. The technology will require the mass retraining of employees and substantial retrofitting of ships including the installation of roughly 7 000 sensors per boat. And do passengers really want to sacrifice privacy for personalization? One feature will allow guests to watch live entertainment in ship lounges on their stateroom televisions  ?   and the performers will know who is watching and will be trained to do  . (?Hello to Brooks tuning in from his bed on the Promenade Deck! ?) Mr. Padgett acknowledged that some guests will have ?creepiness factor? questions. But he expects the vast majority to participate. ?As long as you benefit the guest they don?t mind sharing? personal information he said. Using the connected app guests can order food to be delivered wherever they plan to be at a designated time. (Waiters will know who you are because your photograph will pop up on an   device when they get close to your medallion.) By loading preferences into the app while still at home Carnival will be able to offer tailored lists of activities. ?The goal of preplanning is learning more about our guests? said Michael G. Jungen who joined Carnival in 2015 as vice president for design and technology after 15 years at Disney. He noted that passengers would have the option of linking their medallions with social media accounts allowing Carnival to delve even deeper. As Carnival designed the Ocean Medallion system inside an unmarked building here in suburban Miami it built a replica set of staterooms corridors and other ship facilities to test concepts. Scribbles on a monumental white board in one area contained algorithms and personalization ideas. (?What time you eat dinner. What channels you watch. ?) When they were leading Disney?s technology effort in 2013 Mr. Padgett and Mr. Jungen built a similar laboratory experimenting with ideas that ultimately became MyMagic+ the theme park wristband system that serves as wallet room key admission ticket photograph collector and   pass. As he gave a reporter a tour of the Carnival site Mr. Padgett continually returned to the topic of Disney  ?   how the cost of cruising compares with a family trip to Disney World and how Disney frames vacations as overarching stories. ?The ultimate goal here? he said turning to a   Disney phrase ?is to delight and surprise our guests. ?
80,17376,2 Credit-Reporting Agencies Must Pay $23 Million for Deceptive Practices - The New York Times,New York Times,Reuters,1/3/2017,2017,1,,The nation?s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1 but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes they will obtain customers? consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. ?Credit scores are central to a consumer?s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them? Richard Cordray the bureau?s director said in a statement. Neither TransUnion which is based in Chicago nor Equifax which is based in Atlanta admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman David Blumberg and an Equifax spokeswoman Ines Gutzmer said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015 under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general the   agencies agreed to improve how they fixed mistakes and addressed disputes.
81,17378,Coal Fire Not Just Iceberg Doomed the Titanic a Journalist Claims - The New York Times,New York Times,Dan Bilefsky,1/4/2017,2017,1,,LONDON  ?   Maybe it wasn?t just the iceberg. Ever since the Titanic sank more than 104 years ago killing more than 1 500 men women and children mystery has swirled around the tragedy. No one doubts that the ship collided at high speed with an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland. But a new documentary posits that the sinking of the ship  ?   hailed at the time as the largest ever built and praised for its professed unsinkability  ?   may have been accelerated by a giant coal fire in its hull that appeared to have started as long as three weeks before it set off on its fateful journey to New York from Southampton England. In the documentary which was broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain on New Year?s Day Senan Molony an Irish journalist who has spent more than 30 years researching the Titanic contends that the fire in a    bunker next to one of the ship?s boiler rooms damaged its hull helping to seal its fate long before it slammed into the iceberg. ?It?s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire ice and criminal negligence? he argues in the documentary ?Titanic: The New Evidence? which will air in the United States on the Smithsonian Channel on January 21. ?The fire was known about but it was played down. She should never have been put to sea. ? Mr. Molony?s potential breakthrough can be traced to an attic in Wiltshire in southwest England where a previously unpublished album of photographs chronicling the ship?s construction and the preparations for its maiden voyage had been gathering dust for more than a century. The photographs were discovered by a descendant of a director of the   company Harland and Wolff that built the Titanic. About four years ago a collaborator of Mr. Molony?s acquired the rare photographs of the ship meticulously taken by Harland and Wolff?s engineering chief before it left a Belfast shipyard. When the two men looked closely at the images Mr. Molony said they were shocked to discover a    diagonal black mark on the hull?s front starboard side close to where the ship was pierced by the iceberg. An analysis by engineers at Imperial College London subsequently revealed that the mark was most likely caused by a fire in a coal bunker of the ship. Mr. Molony called the photographs ?the Titanic equivalent of Tutankhamen?s tomb? because of the richness of historical detail they conveyed including the mark highlighting the extent of the damage. Experts said the theory was compelling but were divided over how important a role the fire may have played. In an interview Richard de Kerbrech a marine engineer based on the Isle of Wight who has written two books on the Titanic disaster said that the fire would have damaged the ship?s bulkhead a wall of steel within the ship?s hull and made it more vulnerable after it was pierced by an iceberg. An official British inquiry in 1912 mentioned the fire but the judge who presided over it whom critics saw as sympathetic to shipping interests played it down. ?This discovery is a revelation and could change our knowledge of the history of what happened? Mr. de Kerbrech said. Mr. Molony contends that the ship?s owners knew about the fire but chose to let it go since delaying the ship?s journey would have been financially ruinous. At the time of departure the ship was berthed so that the marks caused by the fire were facing the sea away from the dock and therefore concealed from passengers. The Titanic disaster has long fanned conspiracy theories among them that it was not the Titanic that sank on April 15 1912 but rather the Olympic its sister ship that the Titanic was torpedoed by a German   or that the ship was brought down by a sarcophagus containing an Egyptian priestess?s mummy. Popularized by Hollywood the story of the Titanic continues to exert a hold on popular culture. Construction of a   replica recently began at a theme park in China. Mr. Molony said his fascination took root when he was 12 and was gripped by ?A Night to Remember? Walter Lord?s 1955 book recounting the Titanic?s final night. He said he was so captivated that he finished the book in two hours and 40 minutes the same time it took the Titanic to sink. Now the political editor at The Irish Daily Mail Mr. Molony who has also written a book called ?The Irish Aboard Titanic? was also drawn to the social divisions reflected on the ship where   cabins hosted millionaires while hundreds of   passengers many of them Irish stayed below. Mr. Molony said he believed the fire had been played down in part because death by iceberg was a more dramatic explanation. ?The ship was seen as a heroic unsinkable ship and as a result people focused on explanations that fed that narrative? he said. Not everyone is convinced. David Hill a former honorary secretary of the British Titanic Society who has been studying the cause of the sinking since the 1950s argued that while the damage caused by the fire to the steel walls protecting the hull may have hastened the disaster the blaze was not the decisive factor. ?When the Titanic hit the iceberg close to midnight on April 14 1912 it created a    line of damage on the starboard section of the hull including punctures and gashes that opened up too many compartments to the sea so that the weight of the water dragged the bow down so low that the ship eventually sank? he said. ?A fire may have accelerated this. But in my view the Titanic would have sunk anyways. ? He added: ?It amazes me how this ship still captures the global imagination. It was not the   catastrophe at sea. But it is the one everyone remembers. ?
82,17379,Chase Sapphire Reserve Card?s Huge Bonus Will Be Slashed - The New York Times,New York Times,Ron Lieber,1/23/2017,2017,1,,When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing   bonuses at credit card customers it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear. And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve a card that the bank JPMorgan Chase introduced last summer. The bank offered a   bonus worth $1 500 to people who spent $4 000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel. Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half. Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12. You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch according to a bank spokeswoman Ashley E. Dodd who confirmed the changes. The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. Even without the outsize bonus which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers the card is likely to remain popular. While it has a steep $450 annual fee cardholders receive a $300 credit each year for any travel spending they put on the card. And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas. The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the   bonus. Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative   offers while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers? application sites. If those customers keep the cards for a few years (and especially if they run up balances and pay interest) the banks can come out ahead. With too many people gaming the offer however bank profitability can suffer especially when the   bonuses are so large that they attract hordes of   consumers.
83,17381,Broadway Breaks Multiple Records Through New Year?s Weekend - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael Paulson,1/5/2017,2017,1,,Broadway rang out 2016 with a very big bang. The 33 plays and musicals running last week brought in a whopping $49. 7 million making it the   week in Broadway history. It was also the   week on record with 359 495 people seeing Broadway shows. All around Times Square records were toppled like pins in a bowling alley: It was the best week ever for   shows like ?Chicago? ?Jersey Boys? and ?The Lion King? the most money ever grossed at multiple theaters built more than a century ago (for example $911 000 by ?Oh Hello? at the Lyceum which was built in 1903) the most performances ever by a single show during a   period (17 by ?The Illusionists?) and the most money ever grossed by a single show ($3. 3 million by ?Hamilton?). An astonishing 24 shows grossed more than $1 million last week including seven that grossed more than $2 million according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. Three shows topped the $3 million mark: ?Hamilton? ?Wicked? and ?The Lion King. ? The grosses for the week ending Jan. 1 were 63 percent higher than the previous week and 15 percent higher than the same week the previous year (even though there were five more shows playing at the same time last year). Why? The most significant factor appears to be pricing: The base prices for many Broadway shows are high and the premium prices charged over the holiday period were even higher.   shows had an average price over $100. And for ?Hamilton? now the industry leader in pricing the average price was $310 and the top price was $998. (That?s the price charged by the box office the first time a ticket was sold many people paid higher prices purchasing from resellers.) There were other factors contributing to the Broadway bonanza. New York City was wrapping up a banner year for tourism: an estimated 60. 3 million visitors up from 58. 5 million the previous year according to Christopher Heywood a spokesman for NYC  Company the city?s tourism agency. The period between Christmas and New Year?s is always popular for tourists  ?   and lucrative for Broadway  ?   but especially so this winter because Christmas and New Year?s fell on weekends and many people took off work the week in between. Multiple shows that aim heavily at tourists did extraordinarily well. For example: Cirque du Soleil?s first Broadway venture ?Paramour? had its best week yet at $1. 9 million and ?The Phantom of the Opera? the   Broadway show and a reliable barometer for tourist traffic had its best week too also at $1. 9 million. Broadway took advantage of the expected high tourism last week by staging more performances. The usual Broadway schedule sees shows staged eight times a week but last week 25 shows had nine performances. And then there was ?The Illusionists? a holiday season magic show which managed to have 17 performances by scheduling shows three times a day Monday through Friday and then twice on Sunday. Other factors: Broadway is on an upswing. Grosses and attendance have been growing for several years and the current season has already featured strong starts for three new musicals: ?Natasha Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812? ?A Bronx Tale? and ?Dear Evan Hansen. ? ?The record just broken for both attendance and grosses for the last week reflects the continuing success of the range of theater being produced on Broadway? said Charlotte St. Martin the president of the Broadway League. Several shows that had announced closing dates had a surge of   patrons. ?Matilda? closed on Sunday after its best week ($1. 9 million) and ?Jersey Boys? which closes on Jan. 15 set a record too ($1. 8 million). Some plays benefited as well: ?The Humans? which won the Tony for best new play last year grossed an impressive $815 000 as it prepared to close on Jan. 15. Of course the good news is not likely to last. January and February are generally soft months for Broadway. Thirteen shows are scheduled to close between Dec. 31 and Jan. 29 as theaters clear the decks for a round of openings in late winter and spring.
84,17382,Italian Inmates Sip Smell and Taste Their Way to Rehabilitation - The New York Times,New York Times,Gaia Pianigiani,1/25/2017,2017,1,,LECCE Italy  ?   One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier. Others have been convicted of armed robbery drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese 43 is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills as well as to help them develop a bond with the region which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. ?I could see their human aspect once they were out of their context? Mr. Albanese who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. ?And I didn?t have to keep the same distance now that I was their ?professor. ?? He added ?They also deserve a second chance and it?s important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. ? In eight lessons the group of 30 men and women who are instructed in separate classes learn how to taste choose and serve local wines. ?We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory so that they can later choose to work here already having the right skill set? said Rita Russo the director of Lecce Penitentiary which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas cultivate tomatoes take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table covered with a khaki tablecloth stood wine glasses ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale he offered a   tip. ?Do remember even if you had Trump over for dinner the pope would still be served first. The clergy does come first even before heads of state? he said to raucous laughter. The prisoners whose identity is being protected by the prison were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone who works for the local sommelier association then demonstrated how to open a bottle neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. ?Once the cork is out? he said ?use a napkin to show it to your customers. It?s an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. ? Since the 1970s the Italian penal system has focused on   for inmates. However a lack of funds for rehabilitation as well as chronic overcrowding means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs including a restaurant inside a   prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. ?Of course sommelier courses can?t be considered a treatment? said Georgia Zara the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master?s degree in criminological and forensic psychology. ?But they do educate inmates and create social interaction which is very important. ? The classes also offer a ?bridge between the jail context and the world outside so it?s a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism? Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo 53 is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano a local vintner that provides wine like negroamaro for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. ?I see wine in a democratic way? Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. ?The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature and learn to care for it. I think it?d be good also for inmates to try it out. ? Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master?s degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago he had been ?fixated? on doing something for his native region of Salento in Apulia on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf. He calls this collaborative effort his ?first social experiment. ? When Mr. Rizzo heard about the penitentiary?s activities for prisoners he proposed the sommelier classes to Ms. Russo. While it is unclear if any of the students will ever become professional sommeliers the exposure to the world of wine provided by the classes has been very welcome. ?I don?t even drink but I?ve learned to sip it smell it and taste it? said one inmate who is serving a   sentence and who was granted an exception to speak anonymously. ?You can think it?s a small thing but it means the world to us. ?
85,17383,The 2017 Class Divide as Dissected by a New ?One Day at a Time? - The New York Times,New York Times,James Poniewozik,1/4/2017,2017,1,,In the first episode of ?One Day at a Time? Netflix?s reboot of the   Norman Lear sitcom Penelope (Justina Machado) has an argument with her    son Alex (Marcel Ruiz) who wants an expensive new pair of sneakers. ?Mom? he says ?I know we?re not rich. But are we poor?? It?s a casual line that sets up a joke. (Penelope reminds Alex that they have a TV a refrigerator and a laptop. ?Those are things poor people have!? he says.) But it?s based on an acknowledgment you don?t really hear in prime time anymore: that there is a class divide nebulous but real and that your family is closer to the bad side of it. The new ?One Day at a Time? arriving on Friday is lively and full of voice a rare reboot that?s better than the original. It?s a throwback in the best sense to an era of mainstream socially engaged   sitcoms. And just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a   contest it?s a reminder that the two aren?t mutually exclusive. In the 1970s TV was full of characters living paycheck to paycheck whether cabbies (?Taxi?) waitresses (?Alice?) auto mechanics (?Chico and the Man?) or brewery workers (?Laverne and Shirley?). Mr. Lear the sitcom maestro of the era produced a suite of shows like this: ?All in the Family? ?Good Times? ?Sanford and Son. ? Mr. Lear an   populist liberal made   TV about the little guy. In part the programming reflected the economy of the time. The average American wage peaked in 1973 and the middle class was broader. But as income inequality began to grow in the 1980s and ?90s TV like any neighborhood buffeted by market forces got gentrified. Advertising rates became increasingly tied to audience demographics which made poorer viewers less valuable. Basic cable fragmented the viewership  ?   more shows made for smaller niches  ?   and premium networks like HBO focused on series about the kind of people who could afford to pay for networks like HBO. TV courted upscale audiences by showing them versions of themselves. Goodbye Roseanne Conner hello Carrie Bradshaw. With few exceptions (like ABC?s ?The Middle?) sitcoms moved into offices cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably   characters. (A recent ? ? slyly acknowledged this remove its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future ?skilled laborer. ?) Work  ?   nonprofessional     work  ?   became the stuff of   reality TV (?Deadliest Catch?). Just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers shunted off overseas or hidden through     people entered TV through the poor door or not at all. With ?One Day at a Time?  ?   like ?Fuller House? and ?Gilmore Girls? another product of Netflix?s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory  ?   peak TV is restoring something of what peak TV took away: the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the  . The original ?One Day at a Time? based on the   Whitney Blake?s experience as a divorced mother was lighter and more disposable than ?All in the Family. ? (I still have warm memories of Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli duetting on ?Don?t Go Breaking My Heart? but let?s not kid ourselves.) But it spoke to the times. Compared with Mr. Lear?s outspoken Maude Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) expressed her feminism practically  ?   bouncing from job to job getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls. (This was in 1975 just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have Mary Richards be divorced in ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ?) The update which Mr. Lear produces with Gloria Caldern Kellett and Mike Royce moves the setting from Indianapolis to Echo Park Los Angeles and reimagines the family as  . (Mr. Lear?s   remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the British ?Steptoe and Son? as ?Sanford and Son? with an   cast.) Gloria Estefan reprises the theme song now syncopated. There?s a   third generation: a   Rita Moreno as Penelope?s   mother Lydia. The    daughter Elena (Isabella Gomez a charmer) is a school debate champ who sees her coming quinceaera as a tool of the patriarchy. The omnipresent apartment super Schneider (Todd Grinnell)  ?   played in the original by Pat Harrington with a mustache that defined ?70s    ?   is now a stubbly   hipster whose dad owns the building. The most productive rethinking involves Penelope a veteran of Afghanistan who works as a medical assistant. The war ended her marriage  ?   she separated from her husband also a soldier who developed a drinking problem from stress  ?   and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder. The show understands in a way comedies about more privileged families don?t have to that circumstances shape choices and exact costs. Despite the   laughs the series works best in   dramedy mode. The season has a serial arc and Ms. Machado (previously of ?Six Feet Under?) handles the emotional material with a light touch. One of the strongest episodes is built around a long frustrating phone call with the Department of Veterans Affairs as Penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral. The   humor is clunkier. Stephen Tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as Penelope?s   boss and the show leans heavily on Ricky   jokes about Lydia?s accent. Still if the comedy can be dated the retro approach  ?   multicamera theatrical    ?   feels current as the headlines recall the tumult of the ?70s and the   seems to be tweeting from Archie Bunker?s armchair. (One of the season?s themes immigration lands harder if differently from the way it might have before the election.) Of course one sitcom can represent only so much. Scripted TV still neglects   rural America though Netflix has lately stepped into that gap with ?The Ranch. ? NBC?s affable workplace sitcom ?Superstore? speaks to an economy that campaign rhetoric aside is more about service and retail jobs than about assembly lines. Maybe they?ll have company soon: ABC for instance is talking about making its programming more    after the election. If efforts like this manage to find us the next ?Roseanne? that?s all good. But the new ?One Day at a Time? which arrives while Hispanic TV families are still a rarity also casually refutes the lazy postelection punditry that ? ? is a euphemism for ?white? that there is an   choice between the ?identity politics? of representing the underrepresented and a   focus on people?s economic struggles. If TV can help divided Americans see one another better it?s by telling more specific stories of every kind. It?s true that we don?t see enough   people on TV or military veterans or Hispanic families. And guess what? Sometimes this ?One Day at a Time? reminds us you find all those people under the same roof.
86,17384,Michael Eric Dyson Believes in Individual Reparations - The New York Times,New York Times,Ana Marie Cox,1/7/2017,2017,1,,Your forthcoming book ?Tears We Cannot Stop? is subtitled ?A Sermon to White America. ? Which part of white America do you envision reading it? I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities  ?   they are the ones who ask me ?What can I do as a white person?? This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and hopefully edifying manner. What?s your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic? What I?ve seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth for obvious reasons  ?   they don?t vote for you. But I?m not a politician. I don?t have that power or influence but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit. We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth. They are grown! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues  ?   police brutality for instance  ?   are a real and present danger. I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police. These are the stories that have shaped me that join me to the mass of people who regardless of our station in life regardless of educational attainment and achievement have felt this. The president of the United States has these stories the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories. The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren?t making this up. This is not fabricated. I can?t help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people we would just disband the police. Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe. Recently I was outside of Ben?s Chili Bowl in Washington at 3 a. m. and a young white kid is cursing the police and I?m going ?Oh my God they?re going to shoot him. ? And then it occurred to me that they wouldn?t  ?   he?s a white kid. And what did I hear the police say? ?Now son you?re clearly inebriated. You need to go home and sleep this off. ? And I said to myself: ?My God! This is what we want!? We can?t even afford a display of anger that many white people have. At the end of your sermon you do a ?benediction? section in which you talk about making reparations on the local and individual level: donating to groups like the United Negro College Fund or a scholarship program but also to cite your example from the book paying ?the black person who cuts your grass double what you might ordinarily pay. ? That gave me pause! Good! I used to say in church ?If the sermon ain?t making you a little bit uncomfortable it ain?t effective. ? Look if it doesn?t cost you anything you?re not really engaging in change you?re engaging in convenience. You?re engaged in the overflow. I?m asking you to do stuff you wouldn?t ordinarily do. I?m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. I agree with reparations but maybe this is my white privilege speaking: I can?t imagine actually doing that. That is what I meant by an I. R. A.: an individual reparations account. You ain?t got to ask the government you don?t have to ask your local politician  ?   this is what you an individual conscientious ?woke? citizen can do. But charity can?t be the end of it right? The Koch brothers gave the United Negro College Fund $25 million but I doubt you would consider them ?woke. ? No. Martin Luther King Jr. believed that charity is a poor substitute for justice.

Holson,1/5/2017,2017,1,,Cond Nast Publications might be sitting on a gold mine: its archive of some eight million photographs and illustrations from Vanity Fair The New Yorker Vogue Architectural Digest and other magazines. Now given the tenuous state of the media industry the company has plans to exploit it. The archive is housed on the 15th floor of a building not far from Cond Nast?s headquarters at One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. Photographs and magazines some going back more than 100 years are stored in plastic slips and stacked in folders or tucked away in cabinets. Down the hall from the main room is a   locker where original slides and transparencies are cataloged out of harm?s way. Here you will find the first cover of Vogue from Dec. 17 1892 a sketch of a debutante clad in a ball gown and floating on what appears to be a cloud pillow. And here is a photograph of Coco Chanel lounging on a sofa taken by the Vogue photographer Horst P. Horst who died in 1999. Binders stand on metal shelves packed with transparencies from   runway shows in New York and Paris a chronicle of shifting necklines hems and bejeweled bodices. ?This is the history of fashion? said Ivan Shaw 48 the former executive photo director of Vogue who was named Cond Nast?s photography director for the archive in June. If all goes according to plan much of this material will soon be the stuff of   prints      coffee mugs tote bags pillows and such. Further the company will invite the   known as influencers to explore the archive  ?   videographers in tow  ?   to discuss their favorite pieces and grab the interest of their   audiences. Mr. Shaw is part of a team charged with expanding sales of the archival goods. Since his appointment as a major part of the initiative he has been readying an online store to be called Cond Nast Editions. Until recently the archive team?s priority was preservation. But given the industrywide losses in print advertising Cond Nast and other media companies are turning to new sources of revenue. ?These images have unprecedented value? said Cathy Hoffman Glosser who was hired as the company?s senior vice president for licensing in 2015. ?And we want these assets to become more accessible. ? Mr. Shaw calls the trove a time machine. ?There is a story about every picture from an artist what he or she has taken? he said. He mentioned Edward Steichen who worked for Vogue and Vanity Fair for 15 years beginning in the 1920s. ?When I?m holding a photograph by Edward Steichen for that moment I am there. ? One of the photographers whose work has gained new attention since the opening of the archive is Horst a favorite of Mr. Shaw?s whose Vogue career flourished under the editor Diana Vreeland in the 1960s. In October Cond Nast published a Horst volume ?Around That Time: Horst at Home in Vogue? edited by Hamish Bowles. In addition to producing the book Mr. Shaw curated exhibitions of Horst?s work at SOCO Gallery in Charlotte N. C. and Venus Over Los Angeles in California. Others of note whose work sits in the archive and may soon be available to the wider world include Arthur Elgort Robert Frank George   Herbert Matter Helmut Newton Irving Penn John Rawlings and Bert Stern and the illustrators Miguel Covarrubias and Bob Staake. Cond Nast is not free to make commercial use of all its artists? works however Annie Leibovitz who shoots for Vanity Fair and Vogue owns the rights to her photographs. In a   of the archive?s appeal Paddle8 recently offered three limited editions of The New Yorker?s May 2 2016 ?Purple Rain? cover illustration a tribute to Prince by the artist Bob Staake for $2 700 apiece. (One has sold thus far.) Buyers with lighter wallets paid $95 for prints of the same cover at The New Yorker online store (189 were sold Mr. Shaw said) or $325 for a signed   version of the magazine cover (fans bought 121 of those). Mr. Shaw said he had two exhibitions and book projects in development on 1970s fashion photography drawing on Vogue?s library and a documentary in the works on Mr. Elgort 76 the   Vogue photographer. Camilla Nickerson a fashion editor at Vogue who worked with Mr. Shaw said ?He has had to deal with a lot personalities and egos and he is good at being able to cope with their enormous needs. ? But Mr. Shaw seems most interested in the images themselves. While flipping through a 1957 copy of Architectural Digest he lingered over a picture by Julius Shulman whose photographs of Southern California architecture captured midcentury style. ?You really feel like what the room would be like? Mr. Shaw said gazing at a Shulman photograph of a chic living room. ?It?s not just a document. Look at the reproduction quality. I could look at these pictures all day long. ?
88,17386,Countering Trump Bipartisan Voices Strongly Affirm Findings on Russian Hacking - The New York Times,New York Times,Matt Flegenheimer and Scott Shane,1/6/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   A united front of top intelligence officials and senators from both parties on Thursday forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election directly rebuffing   Donald J. Trump?s repeated questioning of Russia?s role. They suggested that the doubts Mr. Trump has expressed on Twitter about the agencies? competence and impartiality were undermining their morale. ?There?s a difference between skepticism and disparagement? James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian hacks. He added that ?our assessment now is even more resolute? that the Russians carried out the attack on the election. The Senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for Friday when Mr. Clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for Mr. Trump the same detailed highly classified briefing on the Russian attack that President Obama received on Thursday. In effect they will be telling the   that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Then Mr. Trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies? basic findings on Russia?s role or holds to his previous contention that inept politicized American spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong. That would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few if any precedents. In a pair of Twitter posts early Thursday Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies? work as well as from his embrace of Julian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks which released most of the hacked emails of Democratic officials. ?The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange  ?   wrong? he wrote. ?I simply state what he states it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ?Intelligence? when in fact I am a big fan!? But on Thursday night the   returned to Twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the F. B. I. ?s investigation of the hacking. ?The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia? he wrote a day after a report by BuzzFeed on the issue. ?So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?? Early next week the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that Mr. Putin?s government used the hacked emails to hurt Hillary Clinton?s campaign and help Mr. Trump?s. Mr. Clapper said he would ?push the envelope? to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies? report on the Russian operation. The hacking he added was only one part of that operation which also included the dissemination of ?classical propaganda disinformation fake news. ? Mr. Clapper will step down as intelligence director later this month after a career in intelligence and military service that began when he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961. His replacement is expected to be Dan Coats a retired senator from Indiana a Trump transition official said Thursday. A   conservative who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee Mr. Coats would oversee the nation?s 16 intelligence agencies in a job that was created after the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks to improve the sharing of information but that is sometimes criticized as adding a layer of bureaucracy. The Coats news came on the same day that R. James Woolsey a former C. I. A. director stepped down as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump citing his diminishing role in the transition. The Senate hearing on Thursday devoted to foreign cyberthreats was unusual as much for its context as its content  ?   a public bipartisan display of support for the intelligence community that seemed aimed at times at an audience of one. Though Mr. Clapper and most Republican senators were careful to avoid antagonizing the   directly the hearing spoke to the rift Mr. Trump has threatened to create between the incoming administration and the intelligence officials assigned to inform it. Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona and chairman of the committee said the purpose of the gathering was ?not to question the outcome of the presidential election? but to move forward with a full understanding of what had happened. Repeatedly though Mr. McCain and his colleagues seemed to undercut Mr. Trump?s past messages of support for Russia and for Mr. Assange of WikiLeaks. ?Do you think there?s any credibility we should attach to this individual?? Mr. McCain asked. ?Not in my view? Mr. Clapper said. Another witness at the hearing Adm. Michael S. Rogers the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command said he agreed. The intelligence director said he welcomed skeptical questioning from Mr. Trump allowing that the intelligence community was ?not perfect. ? ?We are an organization of human beings and we?re prone sometimes to make errors? Mr. Clapper said. But he said the agencies had learned from their failures notably their declaration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Democrats on the committee repeatedly coaxed intelligence leaders to rebut Mr. Trump?s multiple assertions that a random individual hacker might have hacked Democratic targets. Senator Joe Donnelly Democrat of Indiana told Mr. Clapper that in the conflict between the intelligence agencies and Mr. Assange over Russian responsibility for the attack ?We?re on your side every time. ? He asked Mr. Clapper to convey his level of confidence in attributing the election attack to Russia rather than ?someone in his basement. ? ?It?s uh very high? the laconic intelligence director replied. At one point Senator Claire McCaskill Democrat of Missouri wondered aloud ?who benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community. ? Ms. McCaskill said there would be ?howls from the Republican side of the aisle? if a Democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as Mr. Trump had. Senator Tim Kaine Democrat of Virginia and Mrs. Clinton?s running mate used the occasion for an aside about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn Mr. Trump?s choice for national security adviser who has a history of sharing discredited news stories and conspiracy theories. Mr. Kaine said that he was unsure whether Mr. Flynn was acting out of ?gullibility? or ?malice? but that it was a cause for ?great concern? that Mr. Flynn shared stories that ?most fourth graders would find incredible. ? No Republican lawmakers embraced Mr. Trump?s remarks casting doubt on the intelligence conclusions though some were more conspicuous than others in their efforts to distance themselves. Perhaps the closest to a defense of Mr. Trump came from Senator Tom Cotton Republican of Arkansas. Denouncing ?imprecise language? stating that Russia ?hacked the election? Mr. Cotton asked Mr. Clapper to confirm that the actual balloting was not affected. Mr. Cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton might be wrong. Mr. Trump promised a stronger military and more American oil and gas production  ?   policies Mr. Cotton suggested would not be to Russia?s advantage. Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina criticized the Obama administration for its response to the Russian attack. He said the White House had lobbed mere ?pebbles? in retaliation for the interference. ?When it comes to interfering with our election we better be ready to throw rocks? he said. Then Mr. Graham issued a warning for fellow Republicans who might be inclined to brush off any attack on an opposing party. ?Could it be Republicans next election?? he asked. ?It?s not like we?re so much better at cybersecurity than Democrats. ?
89,17387,Dan Coats the ?Mister Rogers? Senator Poised to Be Intelligence Chief - The New York Times,New York Times,Jennifer Steinhauer and Michael D. Shear,1/6/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?     Donald J. Trump is expected to choose as director of national intelligence   Senator Dan Coats a former ambassador to Germany secret foodie and lover of all things Indiana who also served as a member of his chamber?s Intelligence Committee. Known for a   style Mr. Coats was popular among his colleagues. ?I always thought he should wear a red cardigan? said Senator Cory Gardner Republican of Colorado. ?He was the closest thing to Mister Rogers we could come up with. ? While fiscally conservative Mr. Coats an Indiana Republican who completed his second Senate stint this month often found common cause with Democrats who described him as thoughtful on intelligence and national security issues with a sharp intellect and disarming humor. ?I have always been impressed with his demeanor? said Senator Angus King a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats and who served on the Intelligence Committee with Mr. Coats and traveled with him in Eastern Europe. ?He?s not a fierce partisan and knows the intelligence community. He?s very amiable and easy to work with. ? The position of America?s top intelligence official was created by Congress in 2004 as a response to criticism that the nation?s spy agencies had failed to detect and prevent the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 2001. Since then the director has been charged with coordinating the   and analysis of the country?s 16 civilian and military spy agencies helping to prevent a terrorist attack and serving as a central liaison to presidents and their White House staff. But bureaucratic turf wars have dogged the office of the director of national intelligence since its creation. Officials who run the C. I. A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency among others have sought to maintain control over parts of the spying apparatus and to exert influence with presidents and members of Congress. In 2009 for example Leon E. Panetta President Obama?s incoming C. I. A. director clashed with Dennis C. Blair the director of national intelligence at the time after Mr. Blair sought to select the top American spies for overseas postings. Mr. Panetta sent a dispatch to the agency?s employees telling them to ignore Mr. Blair?s message  ?   an assertion that the C. I. A. was in charge. The rivalries have weakened the national intelligence office and led some critics in the government to question its effectiveness. The year that Mr. Obama took office an internal report criticized the office of national intelligence for adding to  ?   not removing  ?   bureaucratic bloat and doing little to end the tensions among the various spy agencies. In 2010 James R. Clapper Jr. the current director of national intelligence insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings that he would not be a ?hood ornament? saying that despite the inherent limitations on his job he would try to bring an end to turf battles among the nation?s spy agencies. Six years later the job appears to have limited appeal to some intelligence professionals several of whom were not eager to serve in the position for fear that they would not be empowered. Mr. Coats had been an early and strong contender for secretary of defense in the first term of President George W. Bush until Mr. Bush?s vice president Dick Cheney successfully pressed for Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Coats 73 graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois and served in the Army before studying at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He began a career in life insurance in Fort Wayne Ind. before joining the office of   Dan Quayle as a district representative. Mr. Coats owed much of his political career to his ties to Mr. Quayle the former vice president. Mr. Coats won Mr. Quayle?s House seat in 1980 the year the latter was elected to the Senate. After Mr. Quayle was elected vice president in 1988 Mr. Coats was appointed to fill his seat he served on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. In 1998 Mr. Coats decided to not seek   largely because the Democratic challenger Evan Bayh was considered unbeatable. In 2001 Mr. Coats was named ambassador to Germany arriving only three days before the Sept. 11 attacks. ?Ambassador Coats found himself thrown into a role he couldn?t have foreseen a day earlier a role in which he would excel but one that would forever change him? Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Republican leader said on the Senate floor last year in remarks praising Mr. Coats. ?Those who know Dan Coats say that day in September affected him profoundly? he said. ?He may not have known it then but he would feel the tug of that responsibility many years later and answer the call. ? After a brief foray into lobbying Mr. Coats returned to the Senate in January 2011 serving again on the Intelligence Committee. Mr. Coats was also one of only a few Republican senators who supported compelling Congress to officially authorize the use of military force abroad. ?You?re asking our sons and daughters to take up our cause? he said ?and every person who is here has to decide with their own conscience if that?s something we?re going to do. ? Mr. Coats enjoys visiting restaurants both in Indianapolis and in small hamlets that serve    food and featured several interesting restaurants and food purveyors when it was his turn to host lunch for his Republican colleagues.
90,17388,The Perfect Weapon: How Russian Cyberpower Invaded the U.S. - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lipton David E. Sanger and Scott Shane,4/10/2017,2017,4,,WASHINGTON  ?   When Special Agent Adrian Hawkins of the Federal Bureau of Investigation called the Democratic National Committee in September 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network he was transferred naturally to the help desk. His message was brief if alarming. At least one computer system belonging to the D. N. C. had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named ?the Dukes? a cyberespionage team linked to the Russian government. The F. B. I. knew it well: The bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the Dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the White House the State Department and even the Joint Chiefs of Staff one of the government?s   networks. Yared Tamene the   contractor at the D. N. C. who fielded the call was no expert in cyberattacks. His first moves were to check Google for ?the Dukes? and conduct a cursory search of the D. N. C. computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion. By his own account he did not look too hard even after Special Agent Hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks  ?   in part because he wasn?t certain the caller was a real F. B. I. agent and not an impostor. ?I had no way of differentiating the call I just received from a prank call? Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo obtained by The New York Times that detailed his contact with the F. B. I. It was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and   campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election the first such attempt by a foreign power in American history. What started as an   operation intelligence officials believe ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate Hillary Clinton and tip the election to her opponent Donald J. Trump. Like another famous American election scandal it started with a   at the D. N. C. The first time 44 years ago at the committee?s old offices in the Watergate complex the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet. This time the burglary was conducted from afar directed by the Kremlin with   emails and zeros and ones. An examination by The Times of the Russian operation  ?   based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack intelligence officials who investigated it and Obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response  ?   reveals a series of missed signals slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack. The D. N. C. ?s fumbling encounter with the F. B. I. meant the best chance to halt the Russian intrusion was lost. The failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact. And the White House?s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the Russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks. The   approach of the F. B. I. meant that Russian hackers could roam freely through the committee?s network for nearly seven months before top D. N. C. officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems. In the meantime the hackers moved on to targets outside the D. N. C. including Mrs. Clinton?s campaign chairman John D. Podesta whose private email account was hacked months later. Even Mr. Podesta a savvy Washington insider who had written a 2014 report on cyberprivacy for President Obama did not truly understand the gravity of the hacking. By last summer Democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day  ?   procured by Russian intelligence agents posted on WikiLeaks and other websites then eagerly reported on by the American media including The Times. Mr. Trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail. The fallout included the resignations of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the chairwoman of the D. N. C. and most of her top party aides. Leading Democrats were sidelined at the height of the campaign silenced by revelations of embarrassing emails or consumed by the scramble to deal with the hacking. Though   by the public confidential documents taken by the Russian hackers from the D. N. C. ?s sister organization the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee turned up in congressional races in a dozen states tainting some of them with accusations of scandal. In recent days a skeptical   the nation?s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert American democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election. Many of Mrs. Clinton?s closest aides believe that the Russian assault had a profound impact on the election while conceding that other factors  ?   Mrs. Clinton?s weaknesses as a candidate her private email server the public statements of the F. B. I. director James B. Comey about her handling of classified information  ?   were also important. While there?s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack this much is clear: A     weapon that Russia had   in elections from Ukraine to Europe was trained on the United States with devastating effectiveness. For Russia with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of   war cyberpower proved the perfect weapon: cheap hard to see coming hard to trace. ?There shouldn?t be any doubt in anybody?s mind? Adm. Michael S. Rogers the director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command said at a postelection conference. ?This was not something that was done casually this was not something that was done by chance this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily? he said. ?This was a conscious effort by a   to attempt to achieve a specific effect. ? For the people whose emails were stolen this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage. Neera Tanden president of the Center for American Progress and a key Clinton supporter recalls walking into the busy Clinton transition offices humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called Mrs. Clinton?s instincts ?suboptimal. ? ?It was just a sucker punch to the gut every day? Ms. Tanden said. ?It was the worst professional experience of my life. ? The United States too has carried out cyberattacks and in decades past the C. I. A. tried to subvert foreign elections. But the Russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark  ?   with one notable exception: Mr. Trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as ?ridiculous? insisting that the hacker may be American or Chinese but that ?they have no idea. ? Mr. Trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether Mr. Putin intended to help elect him. On Tuesday a Russian government spokesman echoed Mr. Trump?s scorn. ?This tale of ?hacks? resembles a banal brawl between American security officials over spheres of influence? Maria Zakharova the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry wrote on Facebook. Over the weekend four prominent senators  ?   two Republicans and two Democrats  ?   joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring Mr. Trump?s skeptical claims. ?Democrats and Republicans must work together and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks? said Senators John McCain Lindsey Graham Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed. ?This cannot become a partisan issue? they said. ?The stakes are too high for our country. ? Sitting in the basement of the Democratic National Committee headquarters below a   2012 portrait of a smiling Barack Obama is a   filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer. Only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture. ?GOP Security Aide Among 5 Arrested in Bugging Affair? reads the headline from the front page of The Washington Post on June 19 1972 with the bylines of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Andrew Brown 37 the technology director at the D. N. C. was born after that famous  . But as he began to plan for this year?s election cycle he was well aware that the D. N. C. could become a   target again. There were aspirations to ensure that the D. N. C. was well protected against cyberintruders  ?   and then there was the reality Mr. Brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged: The D. N. C. was a nonprofit group dependent on donations with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have. ?There was never enough money to do everything we needed to do? Mr. Brown said. The D. N. C. had a standard email   service intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email. But when Russian hackers started in on the D. N. C. the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic internal D. N. C. memos show. Mr. Tamene who reports to Mr. Brown and fielded the call from the F. B. I. agent was not a   D. N. C. employee he works for a   contracting firm called The MIS Department. He was left to figure out largely on his own how to respond  ?   and even whether the man who had called in to the D. N. C. switchboard was really an F. B. I. agent. ?The F. B. I. thinks the D. N. C. has at least one compromised computer on its network and the F. B. I. wanted to know if the D. N. C. is aware and if so what the D. N. C. is doing about it? Mr. Tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the F. B. I. He added that ?the Special Agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed ?Dukes? by the U. S. intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles. ? Part of the problem was that Special Agent Hawkins did not show up in person at the D. N. C. Nor could he email anyone there as that risked alerting the hackers that the F. B. I. knew they were in the system. Mr. Tamene?s initial scan of the D. N. C. system  ?   using his    tools and incomplete targeting information from the F. B. I.  ?   found nothing. So when Special Agent Hawkins called repeatedly in October leaving voice mail messages for Mr. Tamene urging him to call back ?I did not return his calls as I had nothing to report? Mr. Tamene explained in his memo. In November Special Agent Hawkins called with more ominous news. A D. N. C. computer was ?calling home where home meant Russia? Mr. Tamene?s memo says referring to software sending information to Moscow. ?SA Hawkins added that the F. B. I. thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a   attack. ? Mr. Brown knew that Mr. Tamene who declined to comment was fielding calls from the F. B. I. But he was tied up on a different problem: evidence suggesting that the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont Mrs. Clinton?s main Democratic opponent had improperly gained access to her campaign data. Ms. Wasserman Schultz then the D. N. C. ?s chairwoman and Amy Dacey then its chief executive said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee?s system had likely been compromised. Shawn Henry who once led the F. B. I. ?s cyber division and is now president of CrowdStrike Services the cybersecurity firm retained by the D. N. C. in April said he was baffled that the F. B. I. did not call a more senior official at the D. N. C. or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response. ?We are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of Montana? Mr. Henry said. ?We are talking about an office that is half a mile from the F. B. I. office that is getting the notification. ? ?This is not a    delicatessen or a local library. This is a critical piece of the U. S. infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process our elected officials our legislative process our executive process? he added. ?To me it is a   serious issue and if after a couple of months you don?t see any results somebody ought to raise that to a higher level. ? The F. B. I. declined to comment on the agency?s handling of the hack. ?The F. B. I. takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems? it said in a statement adding that agents ?will continue to share information? to help targets ?safeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals. ? By March Mr. Tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the F. B. I. and concluded that Agent Hawkins was really a federal employee. But then the situation took a dire turn. A second team of   hackers began to target the D. N. C. and other players in the political world particularly Democrats. Billy Rinehart a former D. N. C. regional field director who was then working for Mrs. Clinton?s campaign got an odd email warning from Google. ?Someone just used your password to try to sign into your Google account? the March 22 email said adding that the   attempt had occurred in Ukraine. ?Google stopped this   attempt. You should change your password immediately. ? Mr. Rinehart was in Hawaii at the time. He remembers checking his email at 4 a. m. for messages from East Coast associates. Without thinking much about the notification he clicked on the ?change password? button and half asleep as best he can remember he typed in a new password. What he did not know until months later is that he had just given the Russian hackers access to his email account. Hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to American political targets including an identical email sent on March 19 to Mr. Podesta chairman of the Clinton campaign. Given how many emails Mr. Podesta received through this personal email account several aides also had access to it and one of them noticed the warning email sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the ?change password? button. ?This is a legitimate email? Charles Delavan a Clinton campaign aide replied to another of Mr. Podesta?s aides who had noticed the alert. ?John needs to change his password immediately. ? With another click a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account  ?   a total of about 60 000  ?   were unlocked for the Russian hackers. Mr. Delavan in an interview said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack as the campaign was getting dozens of them. He said he had meant to type that it was an ?illegitimate? email an error that he said has plagued him ever since. During this second wave the hackers also gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and then through a virtual private network connection to the main computer network of the D. N. C. The F. B. I. observed this surge of activity as well again reaching out to Mr. Tamene to warn him. Yet Mr. Tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed: He found copies of the phishing emails in the D. N. C. ?s spam filter. But he had no reason he said to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated. One bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of April: The D. N. C. seven months after it had first been warned finally installed a ?robust set of monitoring tools? Mr. Tamene?s internal memo says. The United States had two decades of warning that Russia?s intelligence agencies were trying to break into America?s most sensitive computer networks. But the Russians have always managed to stay a step ahead. Their first major attack was detected on Oct. 7 1996 when a computer operator at the Colorado School of Mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain. The school had a major contract with the Navy and the operator warned his contacts there. But as happened two decades later at the D. N. C. at first ?everyone was unable to connect the dots? said Thomas Rid a scholar at King?s College in London who has studied the attack. Investigators gave it a name  ?   Moonlight Maze  ?   and spent two years often working day and night tracing how it hopped from the Navy to the Department of Energy to the Air Force and NASA. In the end they concluded that the total number of files stolen if printed and stacked would be taller than the Washington Monument. Whole weapons designs were flowing out the door and it was a first taste of what was to come: an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world. But for years the Russians stayed largely out of the headlines thanks to the Chinese  ?   who took bigger risks and often got caught. They stole the designs for the   fighter jet corporate secrets for rolling steel even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the United States. And during the 2008 presidential election cycle Chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain making off with internal position papers and communications. But they didn?t publish any of it. The Russians had not gone away of course. ?They were just a lot more stealthy? said Kevin Mandia a former Air Force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off Russian cyberattacks before founding Mandiant a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of FireEye  ?   and the company the Clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems. The Russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes. A 2007 cyberattack on Estonia a former Soviet republic that had joined NATO sent a message that Russia could paralyze the country without invading it. The next year cyberattacks were used during Russia?s war with Georgia. But American officials did not imagine that the Russians would dare try those techniques inside the United States. They were largely focused on preventing what former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned was an approaching ?cyber Pearl Harbor?  ?   a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks. But in 2014 and 2015 a Russian hacking group began systematically targeting the State Department the White House and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ?Each time they eventually met with some form of success? Michael Sulmeyer a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense and Ben Buchanan now both of the Harvard Cyber Security Project wrote recently in a    published paper for the Carnegie Endowment. The Russians grew stealthier and stealthier tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic ?command and control? messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions. The State Department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders. At one point officials traveling to Vienna with Secretary of State John Kerry for the Iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial Gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them. Mr. Obama was briefed regularly on all this but he made a decision that many in the White House now regret: He did not name Russians publicly or issue sanctions. There was always a reason: fear of escalating a cyberwar and concern that the United States needed Russia?s cooperation in negotiations over Syria. ?We?d have all these circular meetings? one senior State Department official said ?in which everyone agreed you had to push back at the Russians and push back hard. But it didn?t happen. ? So the Russians escalated again  ?   breaking into systems not just for espionage but to publish or broadcast what they found known as ?doxing? in the cyberworld. It was a brazen change in tactics moving the Russians from espionage to influence operations. In February 2014 they broadcast an intercepted phone call between Victoria Nuland the assistant secretary of state who handles Russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with Mr. Putin and Geoffrey Pyatt the United States ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. Nuland was heard describing a   American effort to broker a deal in Ukraine then in political turmoil. They were not the only ones on whom the Russians used the    strategy. The Open Society Foundation run by George Soros was a major target and when its documents were released some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing Russian opposition members. Last year the attacks became more aggressive. Russia hacked a major French television station frying critical hardware. Around Christmas it attacked part of the power grid in Ukraine dropping a portion of the country into darkness killing backup generators and taking control of generators. In retrospect it was a warning shot. The attacks ?were not fully integrated military operations? Mr. Sulmeyer said. But they showed an increasing boldness. The day before the White House Correspondents? Association dinner in April Ms. Dacey the D. N. C. ?s chief executive was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call. With the new monitoring system in place Mr. Tamene had examined administrative logs of the D. N. C. ?s computer system and found something very suspicious: An unauthorized person with   security status had gained access to the D. N. C. ?s computers. ?Not sure it is related to what the F. B. I. has been noticing? said one internal D. N. C. email sent on April 29. ?The D. N. C. may have been hacked in a serious way this week with password theft etc. ? No one knew just how bad the breach was  ?   but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken. A secret committee was immediately created including Ms. Dacey Ms. Wasserman Schultz Mr. Brown and Michael Sussmann a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the Department of Justice who now works at Perkins Coie the Washington law firm that handles D. N. C. political matters. ?Three most important questions? Mr. Sussmann wrote to his clients the night the   was confirmed. ?1) What data was accessed? 2) How was it done? 3) How do we stop it?? Mr. Sussmann instructed his clients not to use D. N. C. email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out  ?   an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the D. N. C. was on to them. ?You only get one chance to raise the drawbridge? Mr. Sussmann said. ?If the adversaries know you are aware of their presence they will take steps to burrow in or erase the logs that show they were present. ? The D. N. C. immediately hired CrowdStrike a cybersecurity firm to scan its computers identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch. Within a day CrowdStrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in Russia Mr. Sussmann said. The work that such companies do is a computer version of   crime scene investigation with fingerprints bullet casings and DNA swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating. And just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar so CrowdStrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Those are CrowdStrike?s nicknames for the two Russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the D. N. C. network. Cozy Bear  ?   the group also known as the Dukes or A. P. T. 29 for ?advanced persistent threat?  ?   may or may not be associated with the F. S. B. the main successor to the   K. G. B. but it is widely believed to be a Russian government operation. It made its first appearance in 2014 said Dmitri Alperovitch CrowdStrike?s   and chief technology officer. It was Cozy Bear CrowdStrike concluded that first penetrated the D. N. C. in the summer of 2015 by sending   emails to a long list of American government agencies Washington nonprofits and government contractors. Whenever someone clicked on a phishing message the Russians would enter the network ?exfiltrate? documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes. ?Once they got into the D. N. C. they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation? said Mr. Alperovitch who was born in Russia and moved to the United States as a teenager. Only in March 2016 did Fancy Bear show up  ?   first penetrating the computers of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and then jumping to the D. N. C. investigators believe. Fancy Bear sometimes called A. P. T. 28 and believed to be directed by the G. R. U. Russia?s military intelligence agency is an older outfit tracked by Western investigators for nearly a decade. It was Fancy Bear that got hold of Mr. Podesta?s email. Attribution as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known is more art than science. It is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty. But over time by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets it is possible to spot repeat offenders. Fancy Bear for instance has gone after military and political targets in Ukraine and Georgia and at NATO installations. That largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries Mr. Alperovitch said. ?There?s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than Russia? he said. Another clue: The Russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the Moscow time zone. To their astonishment Mr. Alperovitch said CrowdStrike experts found signs that the two Russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks. Fancy Bear apparently not knowing that Cozy Bear had been rummaging in D. N. C. files for months took many of the same documents. In the six weeks after CrowdStrike?s arrival in total secrecy the computer system at the D. N. C. was replaced. For a weekend email and phones were shut off employees were told it was a system upgrade. All laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives. Though D. N. C. officials had learned that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been infected too they did not notify their sister organization which was in the same building because they were afraid that it would leak. All of this work took place as the bitter contest for the Democratic nomination continued to play out between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders and it was already causing a major distraction for Ms. Wasserman Schultz and the D. N. C. ?s chief executive. ?This was not a bump in the road  ?   bumps in the road happen all the time? she said in an interview. ?Two different Russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property. And we did not yet know what they had taken. But we knew they had very broad access to our network. There was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. And it was chilling. ? The D. N. C. executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior F. B. I. officials in   nine months after the bureau?s first call to the   contractor. Among the early requests at that meeting according to participants: that the federal government make a quick ?attribution? formally blaming actors with ties to Russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage. ?You have a presidential election underway here and you know that the Russians have hacked into the D. N. C. ? Mr. Sussmann said recalling the message to the F. B. I. ?We need to tell the American public that. And soon. ? In   on Mr. Sussmann?s advice D. N. C. leaders decided to take a bold step. Concerned that word of the hacking might leak they decided to go public in The Washington Post with the news that the committee had been attacked. That way they figured they could get ahead of the story win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by Russian hackers and refocus on the campaign. But the very next day a new deeply unsettling shock awaited them. Someone calling himself Guccifer 2. 0 appeared on the web claiming to be the D. N. C. hacker  ?   and he posted a confidential committee document detailing Mr. Trump?s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides. ?And it?s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks? he wrote. Then something more ominous: ?The main part of the papers thousands of files and mails I gave to WikiLeaks. They will publish them soon. ? It was bad enough that Russian hackers had been spying inside the committee?s network for months. Now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing: political sabotage an unpredictable uncontrollable menace for Democratic campaigns. Guccifer 2. 0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker a Romanian who called himself Guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former President George W. Bush former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other notables. This new attacker seemed intent on showing that the D. N. C. ?s cyberexperts at CrowdStrike were wrong to blame Russia. Guccifer 2. 0 called himself a ?lone hacker? and mocked CrowdStrike for calling the attackers ?sophisticated. ? But online investigators quickly undercut his story. On a whim Lorenzo   a writer for Motherboard the tech and culture site of Vice tried to contact Guccifer 2. 0 by direct message on Twitter. ?Surprisingly he answered right away? Mr.   said. But whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him. ?I asked him why he did it and he said he wanted to expose the Illuminati. He called himself a Gucci lover. And he said he was Romanian. ? That gave Mr.   an idea. Using Google Translate he sent the purported hacker some questions in Romanian. The answers came back in Romanian. But when he was offline Mr.   checked with a couple of native speakers who told him Guccifer 2. 0 had apparently been using Google Translate as well  ?   and was clearly not the Romanian he claimed to be. Cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to Russia. Microsoft Word documents posted by Guccifer 2. 0 had been edited by someone calling himself in Russian Felix Edmundovich  ?   an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the Soviet secret police Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky. Bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in Russian generated by what was clearly a   version of Word. When Mr.   managed to engage Guccifer 2. 0 over a period of weeks he found that his interlocutor?s tone and manner changed. ?At first he was careless and colloquial. Weeks later he was curt and more calculating? he said. ?It seemed like a group of people and a very sloppy attempt to cover up. ? Computer experts drew the same conclusion about DCLeaks. com a site that sprang up in June claiming to be the work of ?hacktivists? but posting more stolen documents. It too seemed to be a clumsy front for the same Russians who had stolen the documents. Notably the website was registered in April suggesting that the Russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole. In addition to what Guccifer 2. 0 published on his site he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications. The steady flow of Guccifer 2. 0 documents constantly undercut Democratic messaging efforts. On July 6 12 days before the Republican National Convention began in Cleveland Guccifer released the D. N. C. ?s battle plan and budget for countering it. For Republican operatives it was insider gold. Then WikiLeaks a far more established outlet began to publish the hacked material  ?   just as Guccifer 2. 0 had promised. On July 22 three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia WikiLeaks dumped out 44 053 D. N. C. emails with 17 761 attachments. Some of the messages made clear that some D. N. C. officials favored Mrs. Clinton over her progressive challenger Mr. Sanders. That was no shock Mr. Sanders after all had been an independent socialist not a Democrat during his long career in Congress while Mrs. Clinton had been one of the party?s stars for decades. But the emails some of them crude or insulting infuriated Sanders delegates as they arrived in Philadelphia. Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned under pressure on the eve of the convention where she had planned to preside. Mr. Trump by now the Republican nominee e
91,17389,Trump Said ?Torture Works.? An Echo Is Feared Worldwide. - The New York Times,New York Times,James Risen and Sheri Fink,1/6/2017,2017,1,,When the United Nations? top   official tried to inspect an infamous prison in Gambia two years ago officials there denied him access. So he protested all the way up the country?s chain of command. In a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country?s autocratic ruler the United Nations official Juan E. Mndez was again denied this time with a jeering dismissal. ?They said ?Why don?t you go to Guantnamo instead?? recalled Mr. Mendez a former United Nations special rapporteur on torture. In Bahrain officials were a little more subtle but the message was the same as they twice canceled prison inspection visits. ?They said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face? Mr. Mendez said. ?It was clear they were referring to the United States and they didn?t feel that they needed to give me access. ? Now after   Donald J. Trump?s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the   war on terrorism  ?   and to fill the Guantnamo Bay prison with ?some bad dudes?  ?   human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses. A return to such ?enhanced interrogation?  ?   and even to techniques that Mr. Trump has pledged will be ?much worse?  ?   would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated. ?Sometimes we see progress and then we see ? said Victor   the   of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims a   umbrella organization for   groups. ?When the U. S. was engaging in torture that created an enormous   of the pendulum? he added. ?There were a lot of officials in other countries during the Bush administration who were saying ?The Americans are doing it so why can?t we?? Now with Trump saying ?I will bring a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding? you can imagine how far we could go backwards. ? Nils Melzer who succeeded Mr. Mendez as the United Nations? special rapporteur on torture in November warned that if the Trump administration revived the use of torture the consequences around the world ?would be catastrophic. ? A fragile consensus against torture said Jos Miguel Vivanco the regional director for the Americas for Human Rights Watch could be shattered ?when you have the White House openly advocating for torture. ? During the campaign Mr. Trump declared that ?torture works? and he vowed to ?immediately? reinstate techniques like waterboarding because ?we have to beat the savages? of the Islamic State who ?deserve? such treatment even if it is fruitless. Since the election Mr. Trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position citing the firm stance against torture by James N. Mattis his Pentagon nominee. In an interview with The New York Times in November Mr. Trump said that he was ?surprised? when Mr. Mattis told him that he opposed torture and instead favored more humane interrogations of prisoners based on rapport building. But Mr. Trump did not close the door entirely. If Americans feel strongly about bringing back waterboarding and other tactics he said ?I would be guided by that. ? Nora Sveaass a psychologist at the University of Oslo and a former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture warned that if Mr. Trump revived the use of torture by the United States it would have a ripple effect around the globe. ?The U. S. is a very strong voice? Ms. Sveaass said. ?It?s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles  ?   the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account? she added. ?If one country such as the U. S. openly torpedoes those principles you can just forget about asking for compliance from states already challenging the absolute prohibition. ? The signal from Mr. Trump that torture is acceptable again comes just as countries from Argentina to Tunisia either through courts or special truth commissions are engaged in tentative efforts to hold themselves accountable for past conduct. In Argentina Omar Graffigna the    former chief of the country?s air force was sentenced to prison in September for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two   activists Patricia Roisinblit and Jos Manuel Prez Rojo. The prosecution of Mr. Graffigna was just one in a series of old cases that have been brought into the courts this year in Argentina as the nation comes to grips with the legacy of its ?dirty war? of the 1970s and early 1980s. In Tunisia a new Truth and Dignity Commission held its first hearings in November allowing torture victims to tell their harrowing stories before a national television audience. The commission was created to investigate torture and other human rights violations dating to 1955 primarily by the regime of President Zine   Ben Ali who was deposed during the Arab Spring in 2011. And in December Bolivia?s legislature voted to create a truth commission to investigate torture murders and other crimes committed by a series of authoritarian regimes from 1964 to 1982. Even in countries that have not conducted such   investigations new     organizations have begun to take root and those groups are trying to make it more difficult for their governments to continue to engage in torture with secrecy and impunity. Samuel Herbert Nsubuga the chief executive of the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims based in Uganda said   legislation that the country passed in 2012 had still not been put into effect. When the law finally takes effect ?our challenge will be to bring some people to trial in Uganda for torture? he said. In the meantime his group has enlisted doctors and psychologists to provide medical help and therapy to torture victims as well as lawyers to provide legal advice. But the moves toward examining past abuses are so far limited to relatively small nations or countries where the focus is on historical events rather than the current use of torture. The inquiries are also often being conducted in the face of strong resistance from top government officials who oppose aggressive investigations even of past crimes. Those modest efforts could face sharp setbacks if Mr. Trump brings back banned practices. ?I am afraid that Trump?s government will question the basic values of the international order and torturing people will be justified? said Carlos Jibaja a psychologist with CAPS a group in Lima Peru that helps victims of torture. At the same time Mr. Trump?s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries like Russia and the Philippines to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture. Olga Sadovskaya the vice chairwoman of the Committee Against Torture a human rights group in Russia said that torture was already common in the country. She noted that Russian prison and police officials routinely used torture tactics with cruel nicknames such as the ?President Putin? which involves attaching wires from an office telephone to a victim?s body and then running electric current through it. The police like that tactic she said because it does not leave marks. Edeliza Hernandez the executive director of the Medical Action Group in the Philippines an organization that documents cases of torture and provides treatment and rehabilitation estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in detention centers in the country and said that most of them had been tortured. ?The government has soldiers watch us while we inspect prisoners? she said. Mr. Melzer the United Nations official warned that if Mr. Trump followed through on his pledges more countries would follow his lead and get back into the torture business. ?What kind of message would that be to the world?? Mr. Melzer asked. ?It couldn?t be worse. What happens to the role of the United States as an example in the world and what would that mean for the policies of other states? If the United States does it those other countries will know they can get away with it. The last thing the world needs is a U. S. president legitimizing this. ?
92,17390,Republicans? 4-Step Plan to Repeal the Affordable Care Act - The New York Times,New York Times,Robert Pear,1/6/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?   Vice   Mike Pence and the top Republicans in Congress made clear on Wednesday more powerfully and explicitly than ever that they are dead serious about repealing the Affordable Care Act. How they can uproot a law deeply embedded in the nation?s health care system without hurting some of the 20 million people who have gained coverage through it is not clear. Nor is it yet evident that millions of Americans with   medical conditions will be fully protected against disruptions in their health coverage. But a determined Republican president and Congress can gut the Affordable Care Act and do it quickly: a    health care revolution in reverse that would undo many of the changes made since the law was signed by President Obama in March 2010. The Senate intends to pass a budget resolution next week that would shield repeal legislation from a Democratic filibuster. If the Senate completes its action House Republican leaders hope that they too can approve a version of the budget resolution next week. Whether they can meet that goal is unclear. The resolution contains seemingly innocuous language instructing four committees that control health care policy  ?   two in the Senate two in the House  ?   to draft legislation within their jurisdiction that would cut at least $1 billion from the deficit over 10 years. But that language has real teeth. The legislation produced to meet those instructions can pass the Senate with a simple majority  ?   51 votes if all senators are present  ?   obliterating the power of the Democratic minority to block it. Those four committees would have just a few weeks until Jan. 27 to produce legislation repealing major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have some practice at this because they have voted more than 60 times since 2011 to repeal some or all of the law. The budget blueprint will guide Congress but will not be presented to the president for a signature or veto. The committees  ?   House Energy and Commerce House Ways and Means Senate Finance and Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions  ?   will quickly assemble legislation intended to eviscerate the health care law. The repeal legislation will be in the form of a reconciliation bill authorized by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Such bills can be adopted under special   procedures. But Senate rules generally bar the use of those procedures for measures that have no effect on spending or revenue. So the legislation as now conceived would probably leave the most popular provisions of the health law intact such as the prohibition on insurers? denying coverage to people with   conditions. Instead the legislation would: ? Eliminate the tax penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. ? Eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. ? Repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. It could also repeal some of the taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But some Republicans have indicated that they may want to use some of that revenue for their    plan to replace the health care law. The 2010 law imposed taxes and fees on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices among others. Republicans have not said for sure which taxes they will scrap and which they may keep. Republicans say they will delay the effective date of their repeal bill to avoid disrupting coverage and to provide time for them to develop alternatives to Mr. Obama?s law. They disagree over how long the delay should last with two to four years being mentioned as possibilities. Within days of taking office   Donald J. Trump plans to announce executive actions on health care. Some may undo Obama administration policies. Others will be meant to stabilize health insurance markets and prevent them from collapsing in a vast sea of uncertainty. ?We are working on a series of executive orders that the   will put into effect to ensure that there is an orderly transition during the period after we repeal Obamacare to a   health care economy? Mr. Pence said at the Capitol on Wednesday. He did not provide details and Trump transition aides said they had no information about the executive orders. But some options are apparent. The federal government could continue providing financial assistance to insurance companies to protect them against financial losses and to prevent consumers? premiums from soaring more than they have in the last few years. Even as they move full speed toward gutting the existing health law Republicans are scrambling to find a replacement. At the moment they have no consensus. Mr. Pence said on Wednesday that the replacement would probably encourage greater use of personal health savings accounts and make it easier for carriers to sell insurance across state lines. Also he said it would encourage small businesses to band together and buy insurance through ?association health plans? sponsored by business and professional organizations. Some type of subsidy or tax credit for consumers to help defray the cost of premiums is also likely. States would have more authority to set insurance standards and the federal government would have less. Mr. Trump has also endorsed the idea of   ?  pools? for people with   conditions who would otherwise have difficulty finding affordable coverage. Many experts have said that repealing the health law without a clear plan to replace it could create havoc in insurance markets. Doctors hospitals and insurance companies do not know what to expect. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance and without subsidies to buy it supporters of the law say many healthy people would go without coverage knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats in Congress say they will do everything they can to thwart Republican efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. They plan to dramatize their case by publicizing the experiences of people whose lives have been saved or improved by the law. In the Senate next week Democrats will demand votes intended to put Republicans on record against proposals that could protect consumers. Defenders of the law also hope to mobilize groups like the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association to speak up for patients. The Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York and the House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California are encouraging their colleagues to organize rallies around the country on Jan. 15 to oppose the Republicans? health care agenda. And to buttress their case Democrats are compiling statistics from the White House and from researchers at   groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Institute which warn of catastrophic consequences if the law is repealed.
93,17391,In Break With Precedent Obama Envoys Are Denied Extensions Past Inauguration Day - The New York Times,New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,1/6/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?     Donald J. Trump?s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods. The mandate  ?   issued ?without exceptions? according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23 diplomats who saw it said  ?   threatens to leave the United States without   envoys for months in critical nations like Germany Canada and Britain. In the past administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a    basis to allow a handful of ambassadors particularly those with   children to remain in place for weeks or months. Mr. Trump by contrast has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama?s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor?s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements. ?Political? ambassadors many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president almost always leave at the end of his term ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts. A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama?s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do. The official who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date. The directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school the diplomats said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. In Costa Rica Ambassador Stafford Fitzgerald Haney is hunting for a house or an apartment as his family  ?   which includes four   children and his wife who has been battling breast cancer  ?   struggles to figure out how to avoid a move back to the United States with five months left in the school year according to the diplomats. In the Czech Republic they said Ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro is seeking housing in Prague as well as lobbying his children?s   school to break with policy and accept them back midyear. In Brussels and Geneva Denise Bauer the United States ambassador to Belgium and Pamela Hamamoto the permanent representative to the United Nations are both trying to find a way to keep daughters from having to move just months before their high school graduation. Ronald E. Neumann the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy a   nonprofit association for former ambassadors and senior diplomats said it was reasonable to expect ambassadors to return at the end of a term given that they are direct representatives of the president with broad grants of authority. But he could not recall an occasion on which such a strict timeline had been applied. ?When you have people out there whose only reason for being an ambassador is their political connection to the outgoing president of a different party it?s pretty logical to say they should leave? said Mr. Neumann a career Foreign Service officer who held ambassadorships in Algeria Bahrain and Afghanistan. ?But I don?t recollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just ?Everybody out of the pool immediately. ?? W. Robert Pearson a former ambassador to Turkey and a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington said the rule was ?quite extraordinary? adding that it could undermine American interests and signal a hasty change in direction that exacerbates jitters among allies about their relationships with the new administration. With the world already primed to be worrying about such an abrupt change ?this is just a very concrete signal that it is going to happen? Mr. Pearson said. At a White House farewell reception that Mr. Obama held on Wednesday night for noncareer ambassadors many of them commiserated attendees said comparing notes about how to handle the situation. Some expressed dismay that Mr. Trump whose wife Melania has chosen to stay in New York to avoid moving the couple?s    son Barron to a new school midyear would not ensure that such allowances were made for American ambassadors. They are weighing a direct appeal to Rex W. Tillerson Mr. Trump?s nominee for secretary of state or other top transition officials to reconsider the policy. Derek Shearer a professor of diplomacy at Occidental College who is a former United States ambassador to Finland said it was difficult to see a rationale for the decision. ?It feels like there?s an element just of spite and payback in it? he said. ?I don?t see a higher policy motive. ? The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. Incoming presidents of both parties have often made exceptions to allow ambassadors to wrap up personal affairs and important diplomatic business while their successors were in the confirmation process which can take months. Bill Clinton George W. Bush and Mr. Obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors. Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered particularly wide latitude to ambassadors facing family issues said Marc Grossman a longtime diplomat and former top State Department official who is vice chairman of the Cohen Group a Washington consultancy. ?This was something that was important to Secretary Powell because of his own experience living and serving all over the world so when people asked him ?Could I stay another couple of weeks couple of months my kids are finishing school? he was very accommodating? Mr. Grossman said adding that his flexibility was an ?exception? to the general practice. ?He was trying to I think send a message that family was important. ?
94,17392,Trump Takes on Democrats and Health Law in New Twitter Blitz - The New York Times,New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,1/6/2017,2017,1,,WASHINGTON  ?     Donald J. Trump lashed out at Democrats on Thursday over their efforts to preserve President Obama?s health care coverage law insulting their top legislative leader and denouncing the measure as a ?lie? as he called for a less expensive and more effective system. ?The Democrats lead by head clown Chuck Schumer know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in? Mr. Trump wrote in the first of three   posts on Twitter. The posts arrived the day after Mr. Obama huddled with Democrats on Capitol Hill to strategize over protecting the Affordable Care Act and Vice   Mike Pence met with Republicans about how to gut it. ?Instead of working to fix it they do the typical political thing and BLAME? Mr. Trump continued on Twitter. ?The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning. ?Keep you doctor keep your plan! ?? He said it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together on a ?plan that really works  ?   much less expensive  FAR BETTER!? The messages could be seen as Mr. Trump?s latest attempt to seize the narrative of the day and deflect attention from a story line less favorable to him. Senate Republicans convened a hearing on Thursday to examine intelligence that the Russians engaged in computer hacking to affect the outcome of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has disputed that the Russians were to blame and he has criticized American intelligence agencies for their work. Mr. Trump also used the social media platform to push back against criticism he attracted on Wednesday for siding with Julian Assange the WikiLeaks founder over United States intelligence officials in rejecting Russian responsibility for the hacking. Mr. Trump?s latest Twitter salvo also appeared to be an attempt to mount a political defense of his bid to scrap the law that has provided health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans as Democrats work to make that effort politically toxic. Mr. Schumer responded later Thursday saying the   was in a ?difficult spot? on the issue. ?Instead of calling names? Mr. Schumer said at a news conference on Capitol Hill Mr. Trump ?should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million Americans who gained coverage that will cover students or   students 21 to 26 who want to stay on their parents? plan that will show how we cover people with   conditions. ? On Wednesday the   appeared to acknowledge the challenges of doing so without being saddled by voters with a share of blame for the shortcomings of the measure. ?Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases? Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday adding in a separate post: ?Don?t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. ? His comments on Thursday came as Mr. Obama took a subtle swipe at the   in a farewell letter without naming him writing that Americans never voted for rolling back the health care measure. ?What won?t help is taking health care away from 30 million Americans most of them white and working class denying overtime pay to workers most of whom have more than earned it or privatizing Medicare and Social Security and letting Wall Street regulate itself again  ?   none of which   Americans voted for? Mr. Obama said in the   letter. As the debate unfolded in Washington Mr. Trump on Thursday spent more than an hour sitting for a deposition in New York as part of his legal feud with the renowned chef Jos Andres whom Mr. Trump is suing for pulling out of a plan to open a new restaurant in his luxury hotel near the White House. Mr. Andres who is   has said he canceled the project because of Mr. Trump?s disparaging rhetoric about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign. Alan Garten general counsel for the Trump Organization called the case ?fairly straightforward. ? ?In short the parties entered into a valid and enforceable lease which the tenant clearly breached by walking out and failing to perform its obligations thereby entitling the landlord to recover damages in the form of unpaid rent cost of build out lost profits and other expenses? Mr. Garten said in a statement.
95,17393,Ending Speculation Black College Says Band Will Play at Inaugural Parade - The New York Times,New York Times,Richard Fausset,1/6/2017,2017,1,,TALLADEGA Ala.  ?   For a band at a tiny   historically black college it seems in some ways to be the gig of a lifetime: a chance to march and perform at the Jan. 20 presidential inaugural parade in Washington. Some of the musicians at Talladega College have been excited to see the capital for the first time. But because the   is Donald J. Trump the school has become the subject of an impassioned national outcry with online petitions threats to end donations and a flurry of    from alumni who feel that performing in the parade would betray the values of an institution founded by newly freed slaves 150 years ago. On Thursday after days of speculation that the college administration might bow to the pressure and remove the band from the parade roster the president of Talladega College Billy Hawkins issued a statement confirming the participation of the band the Marching Tornadoes and argued in essence that the 58th presidential inauguration is about something bigger than Mr. Trump. ?We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade? Dr. Hawkins said. ?As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power. ? Similar issues have been raised about other entertainers scheduled to perform among them the Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. But because of Talladega?s history the issues have been especially intense here with calls for the college to reverse its decision to take part in the festivities. And beyond Talladega the controversies raise tough questions for Mr. Trump?s most ardent critics as his presidency dawns: What is the proper response to a president as polarizing as Mr. Trump? Should the office of the president be honored no matter who fills it? Or should there be four years of pure rejection and defiance? And if Mr. Trump?s opponents refuse to participate in his presidency can critics on the right do the same thing to some other   in the future? To a number of Talladega alumni the Dec. 30 announcement that the band would march in the parade was an insult to the very principles of the college which was established two years after the end of the Civil War. The school is affiliated with the United Church of Christ a liberal Protestant denomination that was deeply involved in the civil rights movement and for decades it served as an incubator for theories and practices of social justice. Nikky Finney a poet and Talladega graduate who is now a professor at the University of South Carolina said in a statement this week that the band should not help celebrate Mr. Trump who she said has maligned women and Mexican immigrants and has proposed barring all Muslims from entering the country. In an interview on Thursday Ms. Finney channeling a James Brown lyric said the college had ?sold out the history of Talladega College for chicken change? and ?maybe a tin star on a hatemonger?s parade route. ? As of Thursday afternoon an online petition calling for the band to withdraw from the inaugural parade had attracted more than 1 900 signers some of them supporters of the college who have threatened to withhold future contributions. But a second petition which had nearly 300 supporters argued that the parade was not about politics but ?about seeing firsthand the process of a transition? and giving the students a chance to be a part of history. ?We are not   thinkers and believe everyone is entitled? to their own beliefs it stated. ?However we are in support of the United States of America. ? As the debate heated up this week in online forums for students and alumni the leadership at the private   college hunkered down to consider how best to proceed. The campus police ordered reporters off the   campus. Brief interviews with a few band members on Tuesday evening revealed a group divided. Jerome Haynes 18 a freshman who plays the snare drum said he hoped politics would not get in the way of an exciting opportunity for the band. In contrast Ronald Peterson 21 a sophomore who plays cymbals said he was going to talk to the director about staying home. ?I feel that those who are not Republicans should not have to play for it? he said. On Thursday afternoon some students said the administration had done the right thing despite the protests from alumni. Antonio Phillips 24 a senior and a drum major welcomed the exposure. ?We?re musicians so this is a good platform for us to showcase our talent in front of the world? he said. His friend Ken Randolph 20 a junior who is not in the band said the concerns of alumni like Ms. Finney ?weigh heavily on the students of Talladega. ? But he said Mr. Trump might benefit from the exposure to a black art form. ?This is a part of our culture? Mr. Randolph said. ?With it being on his front doorstep he might be able to apprehend the vibe and the culture. ? That drama in Talladega a city of 15 000 about an hour?s drive east of Birmingham played out as black activists including the N. A. A. C. P. president Cornell William Brooks were arrested on Tuesday in Mobile in a   action at the office of Senator Jeff Sessions the Alabama Republican nominated to be attorney general in the Trump administration. Mr. Sessions who is white was rejected by the Senate for a federal judgeship in 1986 after he was accused of making racially insensitive statements. To some Talladega alumni the possibility that policies long opposed by   could now be enacted by a   Congress and executive branch was what made the notion of a black band marching for Mr. Trump seem so distasteful. ?There?s a great deal of fear in this country that the Voting Rights Act is going to be abolished that the Affordable Care Act is going to be abolished that Planned Parenthood is going to be cut off from funding that Medicaid is going be cut off from funding? said J. Mason Davis a Birmingham lawyer who graduated from the college in 1956. ?Don?t you understand why we have a fear of the man?? Donavon Jackson 24 a former trumpet player in the band who graduated last year said performing as part of the inauguration would be particularly special for a college of about 1 000 students whose band program is only about five years old. The school does not have a football team which makes parade invitations all the more important. ?I?m honored to go to a school that can say they marched in an inauguration parade? said Mr. Jackson who received a chemistry degree and now lives in Houston. ?Not necessarily for the person  ?   and that?s not necessarily saying he?s a bad person. ? In the statement on Thursday school officials said they still faced the ?challenge? of raising more than $60 000 to cover expenses for the trip. The population of the city of Talladega is divided about evenly between blacks and whites and to a visitor it can feel like a place where racial harmony and discord coexist on seemingly parallel planes. Whites speak with pride about the historic black college downtown  ?   though one white person was overheard on Wednesday warning of a liberal plot to foment a ?race war? so that President Obama might declare martial law before the inauguration. While some residents said the band should stay home and others said it should attend the event in Washington a few spoke harshly of Mr. Trump while hoping the inauguration would help the band get noticed  ?   something the city which was bypassed by the interstate highway system has struggled with in recent decades. Bonquita McClellan 26 manages her father?s restaurant Big Mac?s Open Pit BBQ near campus. Ms. McClellan who is black said the disdain for Mr. Trump among her   peers was universal. ?If anybody would have had us in concentration camps? she said ?it?d be him. ? But she also said the band should go and make a name for itself in the nation?s capital. ?How often? she asked ?does Talladega College get a chance to play for the president?? Up the street at a real estate office near the   courthouse Randy and Heather Roberts a white couple who voted for Mr. Trump raved about the Talladega College band and its performance at the Dec. 5 Christmas parade. Ms. Roberts showed a video of the band on her phone. ?They were phenomenal? Ms. Roberts said. Ms. Roberts 41 said she grew up with black and white friends. Mr. Roberts 48 said he and his wife were pleased to cater to their multiracial clientele. But when they spoke about politics the couple sounded like people who knew something was broken but did not know how it might be fixed. ?It is not going to be pleasant for the next four years? Ms. Roberts said. ?It is going to be a battle. ?
96,17394,Corzine Reaches $5 Million Settlement With Regulators in MF Global Case - The New York Times,New York Times,Ben Protess,1/6/2017,2017,1,,After more than five years of investigations and negotiations the curious case of MF Global is finally closed. On Thursday federal regulators announced a $5 million settlement with Jon S. Corzine who ran MF Global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than $1 billion in customer money. The settlement reached unanimously at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the waning days of the Obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week caps a   spectacle that derailed Mr. Corzine?s career and spurred a number of congressional criminal and regulatory investigations. The regulatory case arose in 2013 when the commodities agency sued Mr. Corzine a Democratic former New Jersey senator and governor saying he had failed to ?diligently supervise? the firm as it jeopardized the clients? accounts. The agency did not directly link Mr. Corzine 70 to the missing money but it did accuse a   employee in Chicago Edith O?Brien of ?aiding and abetting? the misuse of customer money saying she allowed it to be used to plug holes in MF Global?s own accounts. To resolve the case Mr. Corzine has agreed to pay the $5 million penalty out of his own pocket. While the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top Goldman Sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics it is an unusual step. In other federal cases involving Wall Street insurance money often covers settlement amounts sparing the executives themselves. While Mr. Corzine was willing to settle the case Ms. O?Brien nearly took it to trial. But in recent weeks she too agreed to settle striking a deal that has imposed a $500 000 penalty and an   prohibition on her associating with a futures broker like MF Global. Mr. Corzine agreed to a harsher undertaking  ?   accepting a lifetime prohibition from leading a futures broker or registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In effect that means he will not personally trade other people?s money in the futures industry except for smaller trades under certain threshold limits. Mr. Corzine in theory could still operate a hedge fund that does futures trading and he could trade for his own account. The settlement also does not prevent him from trading in other markets. ?This resolution demonstrates the importance that the commission attaches to customer protection which has long been a hallmark of our mission? Aitan Goelman the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission enforcement division said in a statement announcing the settlement. The settlements the contours of which were reported by The New York Times in October bring a   close to the MF Global ordeal. The criminal investigations ended with the conclusion that MF Global employees did not intentionally break the law. Just last year Mr. Corzine settled much of the private MF Global litigation. And a trustee has long recovered the missing customer money (much of it wound up at MF Global?s banks and clearinghouses) and made whole the farmers and hedge funds whose accounts were raided in the firm?s final days. In a statement on Thursday Mr. Corzine said ?As the C. E. O. of MF Global in 2011 I have accepted responsibility for its failure and I deeply regret the impact it had on customers employees shareholders and others. ? He added: ?I remain gratified that several years ago all customer money was recovered and returned to MF Global customers. ? His lawyer Andrew J. Levander said: ?Mr. Corzine has given more than 10 days of testimony under oath and these matters have been investigated exhaustively by two U. S. attorney?s offices the F. B. I. the S. E. C. the C. F. T. C. Finra and Congress. ? (Finra is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.) And yet Mr. Levander said ?None of these investigations have led to allegations that Mr. Corzine engaged in any kind of intentional misconduct or fraud or that he was at any time not truthful in his many hours of testimony. ? The case also concludes a   political challenge for the commodities agency which came under fire for not preventing a breach of customer money at a firm it regulated. Compounding the pressure Mr. Corzine was a sensitive target a prominent Democrat who has been a confidant of leaders in Washington and on Wall Street. Against that backdrop the agency extracted the $5 million payout from Mr. Corzine a sum far greater than what it could have expected to win if he had been found liable at trial. During negotiations with Mr. Corzine last year the commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agency?s commissioners questioned it The New York Times reported at the time. The case against Mr. Corzine was among the agency?s biggest enforcement actions in the Obama administration. And after MF Global?s demise on Halloween in 2011 the commodities agency used the episode to tighten the rules for protecting customer money. The disappearance of the money from MF Global unnerved the futures industry and raised broader concerns about the safety of customer funds across Wall Street. Further review showed that MF Global?s financial straits left it vulnerable to a breach. Mr. Corzine joined MF Global as chief executive and chairman in 2010 after the firm had lost money in each of the previous three years. In hopes of returning the firm to profitability  ?   and perhaps transforming it into a miniature Goldman Sachs  ?   Mr. Corzine placed a large wager on European sovereign debt at a time when investors feared defaults in the eurozone. Although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for MF Global and the European bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes. MF Global?s auditor for example made the firm write down the value of a significant future tax benefit a move that appeared to unnerve MF Global?s investors as well as ratings agencies. And after a series of ratings downgrades the firm started to unravel. In MF Global?s final days it overdrew an account at JPMorgan Chase one of its banks and scrambled to patch that hole. That is when the improper transfers of customer money accelerated according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission?s complaint. Minutes after learning of the overdrawn account Mr. Corzine told Ms. O?Brien that meeting the bank?s demands was ?the most important thing? she could get ?done that day. ? Ultimately in the chaos and confusion of those final days customer money was transferred to JPMorgan. And yet Mr. Corzine was not accused of instructing Ms. O?Brien to use customer money for this purpose. According to court records submitted by his lawyers Mr. Corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy after the breach had happened. In an email Ms. O?Brien told Mr. Corzine that the transfer to JPMorgan was a ?house wire? meaning it came from the firm?s accounts. In the years since Mr. Corzine has visited Central America for a humanitarian project and has traded with his own money. His philanthropic efforts have included working with Covenant House a nonprofit focused on helping homeless children. ?With this matter resolved? he said ?I am eager to move forward and plan to spend my time focused on issues that have always been important in my life: my family community and philanthropic causes and markets. ?
97,17395,Sears Agrees to Sell Craftsman to Stanley Black &amp Decker to Raise Cash - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael J. de la Merced,1/6/2017,2017,1,,The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough. In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings how would Stanley Black  Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line? But the response from Stanley Black  Decker?s chief executive James M. Loree acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. ?We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears? Mr. Loree said adding that he believed such a move was not imminent. The sale of Craftsman valued at more than $775 million was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising   cash for Sears. For Sears selling one of its classic brands  ?   one it created nearly a century ago  ?   is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump. Edward S. Lampert the chairman and chief executive of Sears has struggled for years to find  ways to help the company as much through esoteric financial maneuvers as through operational fixes. These have been tough times for retailers. Macy?s and Kohl?s said this week that their holiday sales were weaker than expected. Macy?s also announced plans to cut more than 10 000 jobs and close 100 stores. Sears also suffered during the season with   sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent. Sears has been in trouble far longer. Under Mr. Lampert who is also a hedge fund manager Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers as analysts said pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales. Last September analysts at Moody?s estimated that the company?s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $1. 5 billion. As of Oct. 29 Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand compared with $3. 1 billion in   debt the company said. Its market value Thursday morning by comparison was $1. 2 billion even with a jump in its stock price after the Craftsman news. Sears shares surged as much as 8 percent on Thursday before ending up 0. 3 percent on a day when some retail stocks tumbled. Sears has long been dogged by predictions that it would eventually be forced into bankruptcy. But on Thursday the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $1 billion through a $500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from Mr. Lampert?s hedge fund. ?We are taking strong decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment? Mr. Lampert the company?s biggest shareholder said in a statement. Stanley Black  Decker will be able to sell Craftsman tools in even more outlets. Today only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside Sears stores. ?Craftsman is a legendary American brand? Mr. Loree said in a statement. ?This agreement represents a significant opportunity to grow the market. ? Reaching the deal took months as Mr. Loree acknowledged on the analyst call. Last spring Sears announced that it had hired the banks Citigroup and LionTree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its   brands including Craftsman DieHard and Kenmore to raise money. Stanley Black  Decker was one of several dozens of companies approached during the summer about bidding on the tool business. But after the company and its bankers at Deutsche Bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid Stanley Black  Decker turned its eyes toward buying Newell Brands? tool business a deal announced in October. By late fall however Sears returned to ask if Stanley Black  Decker would reconsider a bid for Craftsman. Under the deal Stanley Black  Decker will pay $525 million when the transaction closes which is expected to occur by   and an additional $250 million at the end of the third year after closing. Sears will also collect a percentage of new Craftsman sales for 15 years after the deal closes. The transaction is now valued at $900 million. ?We literally spent months putting this transaction together and to cover each other?s needs and manage the risk profile for both parties? Mr. Loree told analysts.
98,17396,L.I.R.R. Train That Crashed Was Going Over Twice Speed Limit Inquiry Finds - The New York Times,New York Times,Emma G. Fitzsimmons,1/6/2017,2017,1,,A Long Island Rail Road train that crashed in Brooklyn on Wednesday was going more than twice the speed limit when it slammed into a train station injuring more than 100 people federal investigators said on Thursday. The train was traveling at more than 10 miles per hour when it hit the end of the tracks at Atlantic Terminal where the speed limit is 5 m. p. h. said Ted Turpin an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. He said that federal officials were investigating the crash and had not yet determined the cause. The train rammed into a bumping block during the morning rush striking a room beyond the track and causing the first two cars to derail. The accident was reminiscent of a deadly crash in September in which a New Jersey Transit train plowed into Hoboken Terminal killing a woman and injuring over 100 people. (That train was also traveling over twice the speed limit there when it crashed.) On Thursday Mr. Turpin said the engineer who was operating the Long Island Rail Road train told investigators he could not remember the crash. ?He does recall entering into the station and controlling the speed of the train? Mr. Turpin said at a news conference. ?But then the next thing he realized was after the collision. ? Investigators have not released the engineer?s name but Mr. Turpin said that he was 50 and had started as an engineer at the railroad in 1999. The engineer had started working around midnight on Tuesday and was nearing the end of his shift at the time of the crash Mr. Turpin said. In the Hoboken crash the engineer Thomas Gallagher also said he did not remember the crash. His lawyer later said that Mr. Gallagher had an undiagnosed sleep disorder and discovered after the crash that he had severe sleep apnea which disrupts sleep and may cause excessive daytime sleepiness. The engineer of the Long Island Rail Road train has been tested for drugs but the results were not available federal investigators said on Thursday. The engineer told investigators that he was not using his cellphone at the time of the crash. Federal investigators said they planned on Friday to interview a conductor and an assistant conductor who were also on the train. They also intend to interview two railroad employees who witnessed the crash. Mr. Turpin noted that a safety technology known as positive train control was not in place on the tracks where the crash happened even though it was possible that the technology could have slowed the train. Officials from the safety board have long called for railroads to install the system to help prevent train accidents though Mr. Turpin noted it was not required in train terminals. Nearly two years ago the Metropolitan Transportation Authority secured a nearly $1 billion loan from the Federal Railroad Administration to install positive train control on the Long Island Rail Road and   Railroad. Officials at the authority are working to meet a 2018 deadline to install the technology.
99,17397,Record 2016 for U.S. Auto Industry Long Road Back May Be at End - The New York Times,New York Times,Bill Vlasic,1/5/2017,2017,1,,DETROIT  ?   Unexpectedly strong sales of new vehicles in the United States in December propelled the industry to another record figure in 2016: 17. 55 million sold. That is the good news. The bad news though is that the late push to beat the previous record 17. 47 million vehicles sold in 2015 came at a steep cost as companies piled on higher sales incentives to lure consumers to their showrooms. And with the American market tilting more than ever toward sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles companies are cutting production of passenger cars to reduce big inventories of   models. As a result there is little expectation that the sales will continue on this upward trajectory  ?   at least not without cutting deep into profits. That means the numbers released Wednesday could be the   mark for the industry?s impressive comeback from the depths of the recession when annual sales fell below 11 million vehicles and General Motors and Chrysler needed government bailouts to survive. Adding to the challenge is the potential for major changes in federal regulatory and trade policies by the Trump administration setting up an uncertain year for an industry that has been barreling along. ?One of the problems with predicting 2017 is it is the year of unknowns? said Michelle Krebs an analyst with the   site Autotrader. ?We are hearing a lot of different things about border tariffs and regulatory policies but we don?t know what the whole picture looks like. ? Most major automakers are making big profits these days as consumers replace aging cars and trucks with new models loaded with technology that last year sold for an average sticker price above $35 000. Yet companies face a new set of challenges posed by slower growth and industry executives are bracing for potential tariffs on vehicles imported into the United States from Mexico or other adjustments in trade policies that could upset the global pipeline of parts to vehicle assembly plants. The uncertainty extends to the market itself which has steadily grown year after year as consumers took advantage of easy credit and better economic conditions to replace aging vehicles. Demand however has leveled off and companies are falling back on old habits to move excess inventories. Analysts reported that sales incentives were about 25 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the same period a year earlier even though overall sales were flat. That is partly because of a sustained slump in sales of small and midsize cars which has offset the increased demand for trucks and S. U. V. s. But it forces automakers to rely on discounts to sell less popular models adjust production plans on the fly and lay off workers at some of their factories. General Motors the nation?s largest automaker has announced plans to cut shifts of workers at three assembly plants that build cars in Michigan and Ohio and analysts expect more adjustments across the industry as companies try to better match supply with demand. ?We do expect production will likely be cut particularly in the compact and midsize segments? said Alec Gutierrez an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. The industry sold 1. 69 million vehicles during the month of December an increase of about 3 percent from the same period a year earlier according to the research firm Autodata. The 17. 55 million sold over the year was a gain of 0. 4 percent. Sales of trucks and S. U. V.s accounted for nearly   of the sales volume during December as consumers continue to turn to the larger vehicles over cars. Analysts expect the trend toward larger vehicles to continue as long as gas prices remain low. Over all the industry forecasts sales exceeding 17 million vehicles in the United States in the coming year although how automakers manage shifts in demand will affect their profitability. ?The most successful automakers in the long term will be able to prioritize profitability over market share and be willing to pull back artificial support for unprofitable volume? said Stephanie Brinkley an analyst at the firm IHS Markit. G. M. said its sales in December increased 10 percent to 319 000 vehicles although its annual sales for all of 2016 fell 1. 3 percent to 3. 04 million vehicles. The company benefited from strong demand for pickups and its biggest S. U. V. s such as the Chevrolet Tahoe whose sales rose nearly 17 percent last year. But G. M. exemplified the market?s split personality as several of its smaller cars experienced sharp declines. G. M. is expanding its S. U. V. lineup and will unveil new models at the coming Detroit auto show. Moreover the company expects the industry to achieve   levels again in 2017. ?Key economic indicators especially consumer confidence continue to reflect optimism about the U. S. economy? said Mustafa Mohatarem G. M.?s chief economist. Ford Motor the   American automaker said it sold 237 000 vehicles in December a slight gain from the same month in 2015. For the year Ford reported sales of 2. 61 million vehicles in the United States  ?   essentially the same total as in 2015. The company?s cornerstone product the   pickup was once again the   vehicle in the American market with 820 000 trucks sold last year. But sales of Ford?s car models fell about 12 percent in 2016 from a year earlier with products like the Focus and the Fusion posting   declines. The third major American automaker Fiat Chrysler reported one of its weaker months in December as sales fell 10 percent to 192 000 vehicles. For the full year the company said it sold 2. 24 million vehicles a decline of less than 1 percent from the previous year. Fiat Chrysler has substantially reduced its production of passenger cars and is busy converting car factories into truck plants. Last year sales of its cars such as the Dodge Dart and the Chrysler 200 dropped precipitously as the company concentrated on beefing up its lineup of S. U. V. s particularly its   Jeep models. Foreign automakers generally reported solid months in December. Toyota for example said its sales increased 2 percent during the month although it ended 2016 with a 2 percent decrease for the full year. While the industry?s health appears closely tied to the continued demand for larger vehicles some automakers have placed big bets on electric cars which remain a tiny niche in the market. In one of the most closely watched introductions in the segment G. M. said it sold 579 Chevrolet Bolts a new   sedan in December its first month of sales. By contrast the company sold more than 54 000 Silverado pickups its most popular product.

101,26540,American Students on Spring Break Chant ?Build the Wall? on Mexico Cruise,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,3/21/2017,2017,3,,A group of American spring break revelers reportedly chanted ?Build that wall!? during a family show on an evening cruise in Cancun SF Gate reported. [The Daily Mail reports that the group was aboard the Captain Hook Pirate Ship dinner cruise with other revelers when they broke out into the chants shocking other tourists on board.  Anaximandro Amable Burga a Peruvian tourist was on board with his Mexican wife Suly when he witnessed the scene. ?Today I was with Suly my wife (who is a native of Mexico) watching an entertainment show off the coast of Cancun aboard a boat and at the end of the show a flock of Americans (maybe under the influence of alcohol or maybe not) began to sing the infamous ?Build that wall? chant louder and louder?? he wrote on Facebook. Mexican tourists aboard the ship reportedly complained about the chants but the spring breakers did not stop. The Yucatan Times denounced the chanting in an editorial Friday saying it was an act of ?xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country. ? The paper also added that the ?racist hymn? was ?far from being an isolated incident? that has drawn the ire of tourism sector workers who say that the spring breakers? actions were offensive and rude towards the Mexican people. This is not the only time chants of ?build a wall? have been deemed racist by others. CNN called a video of children chanting ?build a wall? at a Michigan middle school that went viral in December an example of ?racism. ? Photo: file
102,26541,Surge in ?Honour Crimes? and Forced Marriages in London,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,4/8/2017,2017,4,,  ?honour crimes? have risen by 40 per cent in five years in London with the number of forced marriages doubling in the same period. [According to the figures obtained by the Evening Standard some of the children involved in the abuse were younger than   .  Since 2012 honour crimes reported to the Metropolitan Police rose to 1 081 and those relating to forced marriages shot up to 367. Women and girls were the victims in the vast majority of reported incidents with over half coming from ?Asian? backgrounds the paper reports. Knives and guns were involved in more than 70 incidents and dozens of rapes and other sexual crimes were reported. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Faulkner of the Met?s Community Safety Unit said the crimes stem from communities using ?cultural   religious justifications for male violence against women and girls and other people?. They were often based on traditions whereby ?an individual family and community?s honour is weighted on women and girls? he said including refusing to go along with a marriage. ?We see an increase in these types of offences as a positive step an indication that victims have more confidence to report offences to police and seek the support they need? he added. Politicians today called the findings ?troubling? ?shocking? and ?abhorrent?. Labour MP Yvette Cooper chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee told the Evening Standard: ?Too many of these awful crimes are still hidden. There is no ?honour? in violence against women rape torture or abuse of a family member. ?These are deadly crimes and there is still too little protection too few prosecutions and too much stigma which prevents people coming forward. ?It?s vital that when victims do speak out they get proper help from support groups and from the police to keep them safe. ? The figures obtained using Freedom of Information requests show that ?violence against the person? was the most common ?honour? attack accounting for 85 per cent of incidents. Sexual violence was the second largest category with 56 rapes and 11 ?other sexual? crimes. 84 per cent were perpetrated against women with ?Asian? women accounting for more than half.

104,26543,Jared Kushner at Center of Media Spotlight on Russian Ties to Trump Campaign - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,5/27/2017,2017,5,,The focus of the continuous media reports of alleged collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has shifted to Jared Kushner President Donald Trump?s    husband of his daughter Ivanka and top adviser. [Kushner is said to have discussed with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the possibility of establishing a direct and secure conduit for communication between Moscow and Trump?s transition team established after Trump won the 2016 presidential election the Washington Post reported on Friday.  ?  Trump made the proposal during a meeting on Dec. 1 or 2 at Trump Tower according to intercepts of Russian communications that were reviewed by U. S. officials? the Post reported. ?Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications. ? Michael Flynn Trump?s first national security adviser also attended the meeting according to the Post which cites no sources for its report except ?U. S. officials? and ?people familiar with the matter. ? The White House acknowledged the meeting in March but ?played down it?s significance? the Post reported adding that the FBI now considers the meeting  ?   and another with a Russian banker  ?   worthy of investigation. ?Neither the meeting nor the communications of Americans involved were under U. S. surveillance? the Post reports that officials said. No one responded to requests for comments from the Post including the White House Robert Kelner a lawyer for Flynn and the Russian Embassy. According to the newspaper: Russia at times feeds false information into communication streams it suspects are monitored as a way of sowing misinformation and confusion among U. S. analysts. But officials said that it?s unclear what Kislyak would have had to gain by falsely characterizing his contacts with Kushner to Moscow particularly at a time when the Kremlin still saw the prospect of dramatically improved relations with Trump. The Post?s reporting adds drama to the Kushner angle of the ongoing Russian saga: Current and former U. S. intelligence officials said that although Russian diplomats have secure means of communicating with Moscow Kushner?s apparent request for access to such channels was extraordinary. ?How would he trust that the Russians wouldn?t leak it on their side?? one former senior intelligence official said adding that a Trump transition member going in and out of the Russian embassy would cause ?a great deal of concern. ? The entire idea he said ?seems extremely naive or absolutely crazy. ? ?It is common for senior advisers of a newly elected president to be in contact with foreign leaders and officials? the story stated towards the end citing U. S. intelligence?s belief in an ?unprecedented campaign? by the Russians ?to interfere in last year?s presidential race and help elect Trump. ? And the ?Obama administration officials say members of the Trump transition team never approached them about arranging a secure communications channel with their Russian contacts possibly because of concerns about leaks? the Post reported. And ?the State Department the White House National Security Council and U. S. intelligence agencies all have the ability to set up secure communications channels with foreign leaders though doing so for a transition team would be unusual. ? In addition the Post reports they first heard about the Kushner meeting though an ?anonymous letter which said among other things that Kushner had talked to Kislyak about setting up the communications channel. ? ?In addition to their discussion about setting up the communications channel Kushner Flynn and Kislyak also talked about arranging a meeting between a representative of Trump and a ?Russian contact? in a third country whose name was not identified according to the anonymous letter? the Post reported.

107,26546,20-Year-Old Brit Dies Fighting Islamic State in Syria,Breitbart,Nick Hallett,1/3/2017,2017,1,,A    British man who traveled to Syria to fight against Islamic State has been killed in battle his family have said. [Ryan Lock a former chef who had no previous military training told his family he was vacationing in Turkey before crossing the Syrian border and joining the Kurdish People?s Defence Units (YPG). He died on 21 December during an assault on Raqqa Islamic State?s de facto capital.  The YPG wrote a letter to Mr Lock?s family informing them of his death and praising him for his bravery. The Guardian reports that it said: Ryan joined actively in our offensive against the terror threat that Isis caused upon Rojava Kurdistan. Here in the dark hours of December 21 2016 we lost our brave companion Ryan and four other fighters in Jaeber village. Ryan was not only a fighter providing additional force to our struggle. In fact with his experience and knowledge he has been an example for younger fighters. While he has reached a vast amount of achievement up in our front lines Ryan has served the purpose of a very important bridge between us the Kurds of Rojava. He crossed continents for the destiny of our people and humanity. Mr Lock is the third Brit to die fighting Islamic State. Dean Evans a    farmer died in July 2016 in northern Syria and Konstandinos Erik Scurfield a former Royal Marine was killed in March 2015. Ryan Lock was just weeks away from returning home when he was killed. He wrote on Facebook on 31 August: ?I?m on my way to Rojava. I lied about going to Turkey. I?m sorry I didn?t tell anyone. I love all of you and I will be back in six months. ? He narrowly escaped death on 24 November when most of his unit was killed in an airstrike allegedly by the Turkish air force. Twelve fighters were killed including American Michael Israel and German Anton Leschek. In a statement his father said: ?Ryan was a very caring and loving boy who would do anything to help anyone. ?He had a heart of gold. We ask for privacy to allow our family to grieve. ?
108,26547,Meet Judith Clark the Domestic Terrorist Granted Clemency by Gov. Andrew Cuomo - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel J. Flynn,1/17/2017,2017,1,,?Were you on drugs?? New York Governor Andrew Cuomo asked convicted murderer Judith Clark before commuting part of her     sentence. ?No? she explained. ?I was on politics. ?[Clark?s addiction long predated her participation in the October 20 1981 robbery of an armored car that left a guard and two cops dead.  ?There?s no question I was a red diaper baby? she wrote in an autobiographical sketch. ?I was still in diapers when my mother Ruth journeyed across two oceans with my    brother and me to the Soviet Union to join my father in a   sojourn. My father Joe was a CP organizer from the age fourteen. In 1949 when I was born he was a Party leader and writer for the Daily Worker. My mother like many Party women was a mass organizer working with settlement houses on the Lower East Side and on the congressional election campaigns of progressive politicians such as Vito Marcantonio. ? Like Brink?s robbery   Kathy Boudin Greenwich Village townhouse casualty Ted Gold and Weatherman comrade Eleanor Raskin Judy Clark grew up Old Left only to find political expression in the New Left. ?Some of them were trying to repudiate their past? former Weatherman Mark Rudd tells Breitbart News of the   babies. ?Some of them were trying to better their parents. ? As Clark herself explained during a 2003 appeal ?My choice of social activism and even the vehemence of my beliefs were in some ways consistent with my parents? values and history. But my insistence on the need for violence represented a real break from their values. This was part of its attraction for me. While I was driven to take up their abandoned mission of transforming society I also felt I had to atone for their failure to sustain their commitment. ? Whereas her parents displayed contempt for America by migrating to Stalin?s Russia Judy Clark did so by taking the fight to the streets of America. Chicago cops arrested Clark at the Days of Rage the 1969 orgy of violence that resulted in one of Mayor Richard J. Daley?s confidantes becoming a quadriparetic. Late that year at the Wargasm in Flint where the Weathermen iconized Charles Manson Clark created along with future Brinks   Kathy Boudin and       Diana Oughton a massive poster spelling out murdered actress Sharon Tate?s name in bullets. When the FBI caught up to Clark outside of a Manhattan movie house in late 1970 the federal fugitive ate pieces of paper while fleeing before kicking swearing and spitting on the arresting agents. A decade later she greeted law enforcement similarly. Becoming the only   Weatherman fugitive apprehended by authorities during the group?s heyday proved disastrous for Clark ?  and law enforcement. ?The people aboveground tended to be pretty hardcore? Rudd who evaded arrest until turning himself in to the authorities in 1977 notes. Whereas members of the Weather Underground focused on staying underground Clark and others aboveground fixated on revolution. ?People found each other? Rudd tells Breitbart News. ?Somehow or another Judy must have found people aboveground many of whom I?ve never met who thought like she did. ? Clark ventured forth with several   Weathermen including Boudin and Dave Gilbert in something called the May 19 Communist Movement. The group embarked on a series of bombings helped break   Assata Shakur free from a New Jersey prison and pursued ?expropriations? that resulted in numerous casualties including ultimately its own members who wasted away in prison. Clark?s group of white revolutionaries joined forces with the Puerto Rican FALN and the   Black Liberation Army. On October 20 1981 an amalgam of the BLA and May 19 calling itself The Family robbed a Brink?s truck outside of a mall in Nanuet New York. Earlier that year the group robbed a Brink?s truck in the Bronx of more than a quarter of a million dollars. Tyrone Rison who swore to Clark?s participation in the Bronx job confessed to killing a guard in that operation. Despite understanding the risks to innocent life Clark participated in the robbery in Nanuet that resulted in the murder of a Brink?s guard and two Nyack New York cops. ?Shamefully? Clark later noted of the action ?I contemplated the irony that in the name of Black Liberation a respected black police officer Waverly Brown had been murdered. ? ?She was armed? Kenneth Maxwell the FBI?s case agent on the Nanuet Brink?s robbery points out. ?The way the Family operated every single one of them was armed going out to the scene. She was much more than a getaway driver and a lookout. She was not as certain media and government voices purport her to be a peripheral player. She was a leader of the May 19 Communist movement that benefitted from these robberies. ? In addition to driving the muscle to the robbery Clark carried a gun. Maxwell notes that upon arrest cops discovered shattered glass on her person that came from the UHaul hiding the gunmen and from a police cruiser. Rather than a momentary lapse of reason Clark?s behavior that day fit a pattern. On June 2 of that year a gunman alleges she played a similar role in an assault on a Brink?s truck in the Bronx that left one guard dead and another wounded netting $250 000 for the group?s revolutionary delusions and cocaine addictions. Two years earlier the May 19 Communist Movement helped break Assata Shakur from prison. The indictments in that case named Clark as an uncharged  . Because it looked certain that the remainder of Clark?s days would transpire behind bars the authorities did not bother to charge her in the deadly Bronx robbery or the prison break. Her behavior in custody in 1981 mirrored her behavior after the 1970 arrest when she spat kicked and swore at FBI agents. ?I had heard that story? former special agent Maxwell tells Breitbart News of the resistance that earned a place in FBI lore. ?It predated my entry into the FBI. It certainly was validated by her demeanor that she exhibited   after she was captured fleeing the scene in Nyack in 1981. When they took her into custody ?  extremely uncooperative. ? No mellowing took place in Clark in the 11 or so years that transpired. ?When the court ordered a lineup here?s what she did? Maxwell explains. ?She repeatedly resisted any attempts to go into the lineup to the point where she kicked scratched bit and spit in the faces of   folks hissing and screaming in a demonic way. Jim Stewart lieutenant detective in the Rockland County district attorney?s office said she reminded him of the character in the movie The Exorcist. That?s how Judy Clark acted. ? Her unruly conduct resulted in law enforcement placing her in a straitjacket. Her strange behavior continued in the courtroom. ?I am an   freedom fighter? Clark announced at her 1983 murder trial. ?I don?t recognize the legitimacy of this Court. ? The court reciprocated by not recognizing the legitimacy of the     counsel?s arguments. At her 1983 trial Clark demanded    status the right to wear armbands in solidarity with the New African Freedom Fighters and a change of venue to another nation. She compared herself to George Washington and asked potential jurors ?Do your children play cowboys and Indians?? and ?Are you a member of the Ku Klux Klan?? She refused to remain in the court upon the reading of her sentence. ?The D. A. calls what happened on October 20 1981 a robbery and murder? Clark explained to a befuddled courtroom. ?We say it was an attempted expropriation because revolutionary forces must take from the powers that be to build their capabilities to struggle against this system. ? Something got lost in translation from sixties rhetoric to eighties reality. The Hiroo Onoda of the   ?t received a sentence of    . She received an additional sentence of two years in solitary confinement in 1985 after evidence implicated her in an escape plot. Until Governor Cuomo cut that mandatory minimum by more than half in late December she looked forward to a parole date past her 100th birthday. Now she could gain release this year. Like so many of her comrades from the 1960s Judith Clark traveled on a long strange trip. That journey from Stalin?s Russia to the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women ended perhaps more predictably than the trips of others.
109,26548,Drug Stocks Drop as Trump Backs Price Bidding,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,1/11/2017,2017,1,,Drug stocks plummeted as   Donald Trump announced that he wants ?new bidding procedures? for Big Pharma that would force drug companies to compete for government contracts. [?They are getting away with murder? Trump said about drug companies at a press conference Wednesday. ?Pharma has a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there is very little bidding on drugs. We?re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don?t bid properly and we?re going to start bidding and we?re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. ?  ?The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index fell 2. 6 percent at 11:28 a. m. in New York and the Standard  Poor?s 500 Pharmaceuticals Biotechnology  Life Sciences Index was down 1. 7 percent? Bloomberg reports. Trump also noted many drug manufacturers have relocated their legal addresses overseas to save on taxes a situation he says he plans to address. ?We have to get our drug industry coming back? Trump said. ?Our drug industry has been disastrous. They?re leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don?t make them here to a large extent. ? Trump added he has plans for similar actions in other industries.
110,26549,New Orleans Removes Famous ?Lee Circle? Monument Mayor Derides Critics,Breitbart,John Binder,5/20/2017,2017,5,,NEW ORLEANS Louisiana  ?   The monument to General Robert E. Lee was removed from its pedestal in Lee Circle at the heart of the city of New Orleans. Mayor Mitch Landrieu used the event to claim victory for political correctness. [The famous Civil   monument of Robert E. Lee has been at the center of the city?s most famous traffic circle for more than a century. The statue was put on the chopping block my Landrieu after he began a crusade against four monuments he deemed ?symbols of white supremacy. ?  Other monuments removed by the Landrieu Administration include the Battle at Liberty Place Jefferson Davis and the P. G. T. Beauregard Monuments Breitbart Texas reported. All the monuments were removed at some expense to taxpayers as New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) and New Orleans Fire Department (NOFD) officials were present at each of the removal processes. The money to physically remove the monuments though came from a private donor which Landrieu has refused to disclose to the public. In an address to the city Landrieu derided critics of his now infamous monument removal crusade saying Davis Beauregard and Lee were not patriots. ?These monuments that we took down were meant to rebrand the history of our city and the ideals of the Confederacy? Landrieu said. ?It is   that these men did not fight for the United States of America. They fought against it. They may have been warriors but in this cause they were not patriots. ? ?These monuments celebrate a fictional sanitized Confederacy? Landrieu said. ?Ignoring the death ignoring the enslavement ignoring the terror that it actually stood for. ? Landrieu hinted at what the monuments specifically the Beauregard and Lee Circle statues would be replaced with. ?It immediately begs the question: Why are there no   monuments? Landrieu said. ?No public markers on public land to remember the lynchings or the slave blocs? Nothing to remember this long chapter of our lives of pain of sacrifice of shame all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans. ? Landrieu has been widely criticized for his calling for the removal of the historical monuments with historians asking him to add context to the monuments rather than removing them altogether. The grassroots activist group Save Our Circle formed solely in opposition to Landrieu?s actions in regards to the monuments. They say that the monuments represent the city?s history. Take ?Em Down Nola and STAND With Dignity two     organizations lobbied Landrieu to go further than just the four monuments. Now they are calling for the removal of more than a dozen monuments and street names including: Most recently Landrieu made a broad accusation about the impact of the four Civil   monuments on the city of New Orleans. While speaking to local media Landrieu said the monuments caused a ?great migration out of the city? as Breitbart Texas reported. ?But I will say this for people that are interested in the cost? Landrieu said. ?The cultural and economic and the spiritual loss to this city for having those statues up that have run people out of the city? Landrieu claimed. ?The great migration that sent some of our best and brightest to places across the country that we don?t have the benefit of has been incredible. ? Historians have refuted this claim in 2015 when Landrieu first demanded the monuments come down. They argued that the city serves tourists and locals as a public history museum unlike any other city in the U. S.

112,26551,James Cameron Slams Trump?s Administration: ?These People Are Insane?,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,1/30/2017,2017,1,,Film director and climate change activist James Cameron says President Donald Trump has filled his cabinet with crazy people. [?[Trump] nominated a guy to run the EPA [Scott Pruitt] who has eight lawsuits against the EPA and refuses to recuse himself from those lawsuits! It?s basically the   world right now and the kind of dialogue coming out of these guys sounds like George Orwell? Cameron told The Daily Beast.  ?Alternate facts? There?s no such thing as an alternate fact! These people are insane? Cameron said. Cameron said President Trump is going to undo all the work that was done to help avoid a   disaster that could put the planet in peril. ?Years ago we sort of spotted the iceberg ahead of us and we called out the order to turn and we?ve been slowly slowly slowly trying to turn this   ship to not hit the iceberg and then Trump grabbed the tiller and just plunged it right back at the center of the iceberg? Cameron said. He added: So am I worried? Of course. I?m like anyone of good conscience and reasonable intelligence. I think we?re the biggest freakin? idiot civilization in history right now and they?ll probably be talking about us 4 000 years from now scratching their heads ?  like they talk about Atlantis. ?Who are those guys? What did they do to piss off the gods so much that they?re buried under a hundred feet of mud right now??

But it?s not as if the ? ? believer put aside his political activism entirely during the last couple years. Indeed for example Cameron debuted a documentary warning of the dangers of climate change at the Democratic National Convention in July. The   video which featured dramatic music extreme weather and natural disasters championed Hillary Clinton as the only presidential candidate capable of saving the planet from mankind. A few months later Cameron was among the   filmmakers behind an   video that aired in swing states on behalf of a   super PAC just weeks before Election Day. Now following President Trump?s first week in office Cameron said he is keeping his ?head down? and ?doing the stuff that [he] thought [he] would be doing if Hillary was elected. ? ?I?m making my Avatar films I?m doing my climate work I?m doing my sustainable agriculture work.

113,26552,House Freedom Caucus Saved GOP Majority from Ryancare Disaster Says Voter Study - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,3/30/2017,2017,3,,A sophisticated analysis of polling data shows that the House Freedom Caucus saved the GOP?s House majority from a huge electoral backlash by helping to defeat the House Speaker Paul Ryan?s alternative to Obamacare says Chris Wilson head of WPA Research. [The ?House Freedom Caucus members held the line and the data show that is precisely what their constituents wanted? he wrote in a report titled ?Analytics shows HFC saved GOP on Health Care. ?  On Thursday Texas GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert predicted any approval of Ryan?s healthcare overhaul would wreck the GOP?s House majority in 2018. ?This bill is going to ultimately result in Republicans losing the majority   ?     [and] If we pass a bill that doesn?t bring down premiums and give the American people hope and not give more power to the government   ?     then we will deserve to be voted out? he said in a speech on the House floor according to TheHill.   ?While full repeal and replace of Obamacare has overwhelming support in these districts even keeping Obamacare intact was more popular than the AHCA often by more than a    margin? said Wilson who managed Sen. Ted Cruz?s voter analysis and tracking efforts in 2016.   The same analysis was applied to 2018 Senate races and concluded that ?the House Freedom Caucus did   ?     Republicans? hopes of expanding their Senate majority a great service in stopping the [Ryancare] bill before it made it across the Capitol? Wilson wrote.  But Wilson?s analysis also shows strong public support for an alternative    ?plan that allows for the sale of insurance across state lines expands Health Savings Accounts incentivizes states to create   pools block grants Medicaid and is portable so it can be taken from job to job. ? Wilson?s analysis is based a huge national survey which allows his group to understand the preference of each population subgroup. For example voters are asked three questions about each issue he said. Typically one question is skewed from a   perspective one question is skewed from the right and the third question is intended to be unbiased he said. In turn the team then used three   models to predict preferences among each politicians? particular subgroups of voters. In this survey the models were used to gauge each district?s? voters preference for three healthcare options  ?   continuing Obamacare establishing Ryan?s ?Ryancare? replacement and the third option ?Repeal and replace. ?

Nicholas Kulish reports. [From the Times:  For years a network of immigration   in Washington was known chiefly for fending off proposals to legalize the status of more people. But with the election of a   president these groups have moved unexpectedly to offense from defense with some of their leaders now in positions to carry out their agenda on a national scale.   ?     Mr. Trump?s senior White House adviser Stephen Miller worked tirelessly to defeat immigration reform as a staff member for Senator Jeff Sessions now the attorney general. Gene P. Hamilton who worked on illegal immigration as Mr. Sessions?s counsel on the Judiciary Committee is now a senior counselor at the Department of Homeland Security the parent agency of the Border Patrol and ICE where Mr. Feere is working. Julia Hahn who wrote about immigration for Breitbart  ?   with headlines like ?  Congress Oversees   Importation of Somali Migrants?  ?   has followed her former boss Stephen K. Bannon to the White House as a deputy policy strategist.   ?     Their influence is already being felt. Mr. Trump is known for his    pledges to deport millions of people here illegally and to build a border wall but some of the administration?s more technical yet critical changes to immigration procedures came directly from officials with long ties to the   groups.   ?     Even those who have labored for decades to scale back immigration did not expect such a dramatic change. ?This is inconceivable a year ago? said Mark Krikorian executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. ?Frankly it?s almost inconceivable six months ago. ?

115,26554,Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn Will Invoke the Fifth - Breitbart,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,5/22/2017,2017,5,,Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against   on Monday in a decision not to comply with a subpoena seeking documents according to a report. [The decision reported by the Associated Press comes in response to a subpoena by the Senate Intelligence committee less than two weeks ago as part of its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.  Legal experts have said Flynn was unlikely to turn over the personal documents without immunity because he would be waiving some of his constitutional protections by doing so according to the AP. Flynn previously sought immunity from ?unfair prosecution? to cooperate with the committee. His attorneys said in a letter sent to the committee that a daily ?escalating frenzy against him? and the appointment of a special prosecutor for the Justice Department?s investigation have created a legally dangerous environment for him.
116,26555,Trump Celebrates America?s Faith-Based Foundation Vows to Defend Religious Values,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,2/2/2017,2017,2,,President Donald Trump praised America?s   values vowing to defend them from an increasingly dangerous world in a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast Thursday. [?America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God? Trump said. ?That faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy to deploy to wars overseas and lock arms at home to ensure equal rights for every man woman and child in our land. ?  He vowed to protect religious liberty in America specifically promising to get rid of the Johnson Amendment which prevents churches and   organizations from endorsing and opposing political candidates. ?Our republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government but that freedom is a gift from God? Trump said. But Trump warned that Islamic State terrorists were specifically targeting Christians and ?peaceful Muslims. ? He also mentioned that the Jewish people were under attack from terrorists. ?The world is in trouble but we?re going to straighten it out. That?s what I do? Trump said. ?I fix things. We?re going the straighten it out. Believe me. ? The president paid tribute to slain Navy SEAL Mark Owens and quoted John 15:13 to recognize his sacrifice. ?Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends? he said. Trump also used his speech to defend his decision to restrict refugees and immigration from seven   Middle East countries calling it a ?necessary? step to prevent opponents of American values from entering the country. ?We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation? he said promising to develop an immigration system to only allow people into the country who would share American values. ?In the coming days we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination? Trump said. ?We want people to come into our nation but we want people to love us and to love our values not to hate us and to hate our values. ? Trump spoke about his mother who raised him with faith and he explained that personal wealth fails to bring true happiness. ?I tell you that from somebody who has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success the most material success? he said. ?Many of those people are very very miserable unhappy people and I know a lot of people without that but they have great families. They have great faith. ?
117,26556,Report: Illegal Aliens Forego Food Stamps to Stay off Trump?s Radar,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,5/19/2017,2017,5,,Illegal aliens in San Francisco have reportedly begun abstaining from food stamps in the belief it will help them avoid being detecting by the Trump administration. [In fact so many residents have turned against food stamps that ?the city is concerned. ?  According to the San Francisco Chronicle local Human Services Agency director Trent Rhorer has noted that ?households with one illegal? are wondering how much information will reach administration officials if they use food stamps also known as CalFresh. Eligible families also wonder ?whether the administration will cut food stamp benefits to immigrants. ? Rhorer is upset by the tension. He said ?[Eligible families] are putting their household in further jeopardy of not being able to pay the rent or not being able to pay utility bills because they have to buy food. These are benefits they are entitled to receive and they?re playing by the rules. They shouldn?t be penalized by this negative commentary coming out of the White House. ? In the last two months the number of households withdrawing from food stamps has been well above the norm. For example the normal drop rate is less than 60 households a month yet ?150 households withdrew from the program in March and April alone. ? Families where children are legal residents but were born to parents who came here illegally are most prone to drop CalFresh at this time the Chronicle reports. But the city has made clear that the only people who have to provide information are the family members who apply for benefits. That is reportedly intended to limit the amount of information shared with the federal government. Under the Obama administration Breitbart News noted at the time the U. S. Department of Agriculture paid to run  in Mexico promoting U. S. food stamps so that when illegal aliens came to the U. S. they would be able to access the benefit.

119,26558,?Distress? But No Apology For Epiphany Service Quran Reading,Breitbart,Donna Rachel Edmunds,1/15/2017,2017,1,,The head of the Scottish Episcopal Church has said he is ?deeply distressed at the widespread offence? caused by the reading of a passage from the Quran denying the divinity of Christ during an Epiphany service but no apology has been issued. [In a statement posted to his blog site David Chillingworth the Primus of the Church appeared to strongly rebuke Kelvin Holdsworth the Provost of St Mary?s Episcopal Cathedral Glasgow where the reading took place arguing that interfaith work ?like all works of reconciliation must be founded on truth. ? He continued: ?We approach others with open hearts but we stand in the truth of the gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. ?  However no apology for the reading has been forthcoming Chillingworth reasoning that the ?The decisions which have led to the situation in St Mary?s Cathedral are a matter for the Provost and the Cathedral community. ? He added that the church will ?bring together all those who are involved in the development of interfaith relations? to explore how the work can be carried out ?in ways which will command respect. ? Holdsworth himself is unrepentent writing in a blog post that ?local Muslim friends? were invited ?as we were reflecting on the arrival of the mysterious Magi at Bethlehem?. The significance is unclear as the Magi predating Islam by some six centuries were Zoroastrian. He continued: ?Having a recitation from the Qur?an in a Christian cathedral in worship is not a new thing. ?So it has indeed come as something of a surprise to find accounts of last week?s service appearing online and stirring up the most most incredible pot of hatred I?ve ever encountered. ?This same Qur?anic reading has been given before in services and no outcry has happened. Is it because this is in a cathedral run by a gay man? Is it because the recitation was given by a young woman? ?Clearly those things are factors as they feature in some of the abuse. ? Confirming that some of the messages received by the church had been reported to Police Scotland Holdsworth added: ?They assure me that intolerance and prejudice will not be tolerated in Scotland. To put it simply I thank God for them and their work. ? The matter came to light after St Mary?s posted a video of verses of the Quran being sung in Arabic during a service to Facebook along with a message calling it a ?wonderful event. ? Both the Facebook post and a YouTube version of the reading have since been removed by the Cathedral after it provoked widespread anger and criticism from Christians who pointed out that the verses chosen denied the divinity of Jesus Christ as the Son of God. The reading can still be viewed elsewhere on Facebook via Madinah Javed who sang the passages during the service. There was further anger as it emerged that a translation of the verses printed in the Order of Service and handed out to congregants omitted the last two in which the denial came leading to confusion. Commenting on matter on the Archbishop Cranmer blogsite the Rev?d Dr Gavin Ashenden Chaplain to the Queen said: ?It?s hard to know what was in the mind of the Provost of Glasgow Cathedral when he arranged for this assault on Jesus and the apostles. ?The accusation of lying or deception [contained within the verses] was not just directed towards Jesus and the Apostles but is also [  ?    ] to those too who have been martyred at the hands of Islam because they refused to renounce this deception when confronted with it. ? Refuting Holdworth?s claims that the reading was part of an interfaith dialogue between Islam and Christianity Ashenden continued: ?There was no dialogue in the Epiphany Eucharist only a refutation of what Christians hold most dear and upon which salvation depends. ?In over 30 years of interfaith conversations I have never yet come across a Muslim community which allowed those passages in the Gospels acclaiming the divinity of Christ to be read in Friday prayers. ?

123,26562,Exclusive ? Leading Trumpocrat: Time for Paul Ryan to Resign ?I Just Don?t Know How He Can Be Trusted? - Breitbart,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,3/26/2017,2017,3,,One of the leading Trumpocrats Billy Bova of Mississippi is publicly calling for House Speaker Paul Ryan to do what is right by the country and President Donald Trump by resigning his position to move out of the way of the future of the Republican Party. [Bova was one of the key activists who was a lifelong Democrat who crossed over to support Trump for president against Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton ?  working with the Trumpocrats PAC which helped flip tens of thousands of registered Democrats in the key battleground states of North Carolina Pennsylvania Ohio Wisconsin and Michigan.  In total those states add up to 79 electoral votes ?  and without them Trump would not have won the election. In each of those states including especially razor thin margins over Clinton in Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin it was the Trumpocrats who delivered the win ?  and the White House ?  to President Trump. Bova made his comments in an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel the morning after Ryan failed President Trump on healthcare. ?I think that it is time for him to go like it was time for [former Speaker John] Boehner to go like it was time for [former Speaker Nancy] Pelosi to go? Bova told Breitbart News Saturday. ?President Trump is president because of    registered mostly lifetime Democrat voters in Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan ?  and those people bought into President Trump hard and were for him before they even supported him and voted for him because they love his America First populism. Our jobs first our factories first our legal citizens first our military and veterans first. ?Those people understand that the establishment globalist corporatists of both parties ?  Republicans and Democrats ?  have sold them out. They?ve sold out our working and middle class here in America. They?ve sold out our country people born here in America who were raised up and played by the rules and paid their taxes and are just looking for a level playing field. ?And they also realize that those folks that put President Trump in office that he was correct on healthcare ?  that Obamacare should be repealed but you?ve got to do it in a way that gives people choice. It?s all about competition. The insurance companies have a monopoly. I live in the state of Mississippi ?  one health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield has 60 to 65 percent of the health insurance business. What if you lived in a state where AllState had 70 or 75 percent of the car insurance business? Everyone would be jumping up and down screaming ?why can?t we get different insurance? I don?t need the ugly kind that they?re selling.? So we have got to have competition in the marketplace. ?And Donald Trump is right when we get competition in the marketplace. When people go to a restaurant they don?t want two items on the menu they want 22 items to choose from on the menu because not everybody eats the same thing and not everybody needs to consume the same kind of health insurance or health care. It?s that simple. ? Bova said that a piece from Breitbart News? John Carney detailing how Ryan is already contradicting President Trump?s administration on tax reform the supposed next item on the agenda is ?exactly right? and questioned how President Trump can trust Ryan as he embarks on this next step. ?I don?t know how Donald Trump President Trump and his advisers how they are going to trust him in the future? Bova said. ?I think his credibility is basically destroyed here this past week as Speaker and as leader in the House of the Republicans on Capitol Hill. ?He dropped the ball he tried to do an Obamacare Lite so as to not step on the toes of the big insurance companies and the status quo and the Big Pharma companies and all that stuff. I don?t know they could possibly trust him to try and give us a more fair and equitable and competitive tax structure. I just don?t know how he can be trusted to do that and to lead. ?It?s a shame I?m sorry to say but he was opposed to Donald Trump from the  . So was Mitch McConnell. Much of the leadership of the Republican Party in D. C. in the House and the Senate was opposed to him. I think they might smile and shake his hand and slap him on the back and eat free lunch and dinner at the White House with him but I think they got back to themselves on Capitol Hill and they got their knives out again for him and for his White House and I certainly wouldn?t trust them from here on out. ? Bova said the failure of the American Health Care Act is entirely Paul Ryan?s fault but undoubtedly Ryan?s mistakes will cause some ?blowback? against President Trump. However he added the president can get back on track by steering clear of Ryan?s pet issues and focusing on what won him the White House. ?I think what we ended up with and unfortunately the blowback ?  some of it is going to come back to the president ?  but he can rebound? Bova said. ?President Trump can rebound. He?ll recapture his narrative and get back on trade and economics and jobs and that kind of thing and illegal immigration and stuff like that. ?But I think what happened is Ryan and McConnell ?  especially Ryan and his top people over on the House side ?  figured they would just take the healthcare ball and run with it. I think this ultimately would have turned out differently if this had been Donald Trump and his top advisers and people there in the West Wing and in the White House orchestrating it laying it all out writing it all out and explaining it to the people. I think we would have seen a much more different outcome than what we saw yesterday. ?I think Ryan and his gang of establishment globalist corporatist Republicans who want the health insurance companies to charge higher and higher premiums who want the big pharmaceutical companies to charge higher and higher prices not lower prices who want the big insurance companies to charge a    completely healthy male another $200 a month for his health insurance because he has to have maternity leave benefits in it. ?I?m in my 50s I?ve never needed maternity leave. I?ve needed basic major medical health insurance as a working class person ?  American ?    American. I don?t need a $10 000 deductible I need a $1 000 deductible. ?So I think it was just one more instance where the globalist corporatist establishment Republicans on the Hill led by Paul Ryan grabbed the ball and took the ball and ran with it and we ended up with this incredible debacle that unfolded this past week. ?

125,26564,Kellogg Announces Job Cuts Closures Slashes Sales Forecast,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2/9/2017,2017,2,,Kellogg Company the nation?s largest breakfast cereal manufacturer is again announcing major cut backs and has slashed its sales forecast as profits continue to fall. [On February 9 the   company cut its sales projections for the year after experiencing another quarterly decline.  The company imagined it would have flat sales but instead found a two percent decline. ?For the quarter ended Dec. 31 Kellogg reported a loss of $53 million or 15 cents per share? the Associated Press reported on Thursday. ?Not including   items it said it earned 92 cents per share. Analysts expected a profit of 85 cents per share. Total sales were $3. 1 billion slightly better than expected revenue of $3. 07 billion. ? But that wasn?t the only cuts Kellogg Co. reported this week. The company also told investors and employees that big cuts in facilities and workers are coming. On Wednesday the company announced it was closing a large number of distribution centers across the U. S. and that layoffs would result WKBN reported. Some insiders have said Kellogg?s is looking to cut sales representatives merchandisers and shuttering as many as 39 distribution centers. Kellogg spokesman Kris Charles released a statement saying the move is a ?difficult decision. ? While this is the right move for the company to achieve our   objectives it was a difficult decision because of its impact on employees. On average our distribution centers employ approximately 30   workers. As the distribution shifts from our network to our retailers? networks so too will the work. We?ve been actively engaged in conversations with some of our biggest retail partners who have expressed strong interest in hiring these employees for   roles once the transition is complete. As a result we are optimistic that our employees will find similar employment once this transition is complete so the net impact is impossible to quantify. As the affected employees work throughout the U. S. this change will not have a sizable impact on any one community. ? The closures and layoffs are to be completed by the fourth quarter of this year the company said. John Bryant Kellogg Company Chairman and CEO said that the ?retail landscape continues to change? and Kellogg has to keep up with that shift. ?We have to change the way we reach and communicate with consumers. Because our customers? and our own warehouse distribution systems have become more efficient and effective we can now redeploy resources previously tied to DSD and direct them to the kinds of brand investments that drive greater demand with today?s consumers ? ultimately growing our business and our retailers? businesses? he said. This latest move is on top of the major cuts already announced this year. Early in January Kellogg Co. announced it was firing 250 workers. The continued moves to scale back the company comes after Kellogg?s decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016 thereby snubbing Breitbart?s 45 000 000 readers. In November Kellogg?s noted that Breitbart News?s conservative readers are not ?aligned with our values as a company. ? While the decision by Kellogg?s to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

Friday on MSNBC?s ?Morning Joe? former NBC ?Nightly News? anchor Tom Brokaw advised Democrats to pick and choose their fights including their obstruction efforts of Supreme Court justice nominee Neil Gorsuch.  ?A lot of young people come up to me and say ?I?m just outraged by what?s going on?? Brokaw said. ?I say ?Rage is not a policy.? That?s my advice to them. You?ve got to figure out what you want to do. For example there?s going to be a big pushback about Judge Gorsuch from the Democrats. They?re going to make that one of the testing places for them. The fact is this man has a very distinct background in the judicial world. He has a doctorate from Oxford. I have friends in the federal judiciary that don?t agree with his philosophy but say there is not a better judge in the federal circuit right now. So why pick that as a fight because who are you going to get next and what issues are you going to raise given the reality of where the Democrats are at this moment. ? According to Brokaw Democrats have their own internal problems and not putting the effort to rebuilding their own party will be to their detriment. ?They?re playing by the Republican playbook frankly for the last eight years? he added. ?And the other thing is Democrats have a lot of reconstruction to do of their own party and that?s what they ought to be thinking about and that?s what they should be getting  ?   they ought to be out in the middle of America saying what do we need to know from you rather than sitting in Washington reelecting Nancy Pelosi after they lost the House three different times. ?

128,26567,Jerry Seinfeld: I Don?t Get the ?Big Deal? About Kathy Griffin Photo Just a ?Bad Joke?,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/6/2017,2017,6,,Jerry Seinfeld has lent his support to Kathy Griffin after the comedian came under fire last week for a photo in which she posed with a fake bloodied head meant to resemble President Donald Trump saying in an interview he believes Griffin simply made a ?bad joke. ?[?Yes it was a bad joke. Every comedian tells bad jokes? the    Seinfeld star told People magazine Tuesday.  ?We all do it. That?s how we find the good jokes. So someone told a bad joke  ?   so what I don?t understand the big deal? he added. Griffin sparked a firestorm last week when a photo taken during a shoot with L. A.  photographer Tyler Shields was published by TMZ. The photo showed the    My Life on the   star holding a decapitated prosthetic head meant to resemble that of the president in her outstretched arm. Griffin quickly apologized after the viral photo drew strong condemnation from both sides of the political aisle writing in a Twitter message that she had gone ?too far. ? In his own response Trump called the photo ?sick? while First Lady Melania Trump described it as ?very disturbing? and ?simply wrong. ? In a press conference Friday Griffin fought back tears as she accused the Trump family of bullying her and attempting to ruin her career. The comedian was fired from her role on CNN?s New Year?s Eve Live coverage in the wake of the controversy while at least five venues on her   comedy tour scrapped her scheduled performances. The Secret Service also opened an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the photo shoot. Seinfeld wasn?t the only celebrity to come to Griffin?s defense in a speech at the premiere of his new Showtime series last week actor Jim Carrey advised Griffin to double down on the photo by holding up Trump?s ?severed leg? adding that comics represent the ?last line of defense? in a a   environment. Actor and Saturday Night Live Trump impersonator Alec Baldwin also reached out to Griffin on social media following the backlash and advised her to ignore her critics.

When they arrived they found that the fire was coming from the   ATM. Everett Police shared a photo on Twitter of the burnt ATM: Fire thwarts ATM thieves using torch at bank (10500 19th Ave SE). Detectives investigating  ?   More to follow. pic. twitter.   ?   Everett Police WA (@EverettPolice) May 30 2017  Aaron Snell of the Everett Police Department said the suspects mistakenly set the money on fire while using a blowtorch to access the cashbox inside the ATM. John Dickson the executive VP and COO of Coastal Community Bank said the suspects did not escape with any money and that the bank experienced another   by masked thieves trying to access the cash deposit box a few weeks ago. ?They attempted to get into the ATM and it looks like they used a blowtorch which caught the currency on fire and created a little fire damage? said Dickson. Police identified two suspects from surveillance footage of the incident that shows one of the men trying to urinate on the fire to put it out. The suspects in question are Eli Steen and Jason Kovar both 31 of Everett police say. Police say they could arrest Steen and Kovar on charges of burglary and arson because they have ?probable cause? and are also looking to question them to see if they are connected to other commercial burglaries that took place in Snohomish County. The Seattle Times reports that the damage to the ATM cash and the building is estimated to be $35 000.
130,26569,J Scott Armstrong: Fewer Than 1 Percent Of Papers in Scientific Journals Follow Scientific Method - Breitbart,Breitbart,Allum Bokhari,3/29/2017,2017,3,,Fewer than 1 percent of papers published in scientific journals follow the scientific method according to research by Wharton School professor and forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong. [Professor Armstrong who   the   Journal of Forecasting in 1982 and the International Journal of Forecasting in 1985 made the claim in a presentation about what he considers to be ?alarmism? from forecasters over   climate change.  ?We also go through journals and rate how well they conform to the scientific method. I used to think that maybe 10 percent of papers in my field   ?     were maybe useful. Now it looks like maybe one tenth of one percent follow the scientific method? said Armstrong in his presentation which can be watched in full below. ?People just don?t do it. ? Armstrong defined eight criteria for compliance with the scientific method including full disclosure of methods data and other reliable information conclusions that are consistent with the evidence valid and simple methods and valid and reliable data.  According to Armstrong very little of the forecasting in climate change debate adheres to these criteria. ?For example for disclosure we were working on polar bear [population] forecasts and we were asked to review the government?s polar bear forecast. We asked ?could you send us the data? and they said ?No?  ?     So we had to do it without knowing what the data were. ? According to Armstrong forecasts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violate all eight criteria. ?Why is this all happening? Nobody asks them!? said Armstrong who says that people who submit papers to journals are not required to follow the scientific method. ?You send something to a journal and they don?t tell you what you have to do. They don?t say ?here?s what science is here?s how to do it. ?? Digging deeper into their motivations Armstrong pointed to the wealth of incentives for publishing papers with politically convenient rather than scientific conclusions. ?They?re rewarded for doing   research. One of my favourite examples is testing statistical significance  ?   that?s invalid. It?s been over 100 years we?ve been fighting the fight against that. Even its inventor thought it wasn?t going to amount to anything. You can be rewarded then for following an invalid [method]. ? ?They cheat. If you don?t get statistically significant results then you throw out variables add variables [and] eventually you get what you want. ? ?My big thing is advocacy. People are asked to come up with certain answers and in our whole field that?s been a general movement ever since I?ve been here and it just gets worse every year. And the reason is funded research. ? ?I?ve [gone through] my whole career with lots of publications and I?ve never gotten a research grant. And I?m proud of that now. ? Armstrong concluded his talk by arguing that scientific evidence should be required for all climate regulations. You can follow Allum Bokhari on Twitter and add him on Facebook.

C. this week abortion provider Planned Parenthood has released an animated video of its own   history narrated by celebrities including Lena Dunham Meryl Streep and Mindy Kaling. [Dunham the creator and star of HBO?s Girls and a   activist shared the Planned Parenthood anniversary video on her Twitter account Tuesday morning.  ?This is the story of the incredible women who sacrificed everything to bring us safe and affordable reproductive health care? the video?s opening title card reads. I made this video   @mindykaling @amyschumer @TessaThompson_x Meryl Streep  more because we show up for @PPFA: https:  .   ?   Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) January 17 2017  The video guides viewers through the early days of the organization and details the life of its founder Margaret Sanger. ?Margaret knew how to work the press? narrates Mindy Kaling the star of Hulu?s The Mindy Project. ?When she chose jail time over fines for running a birth control clinic her case became a national sensation. ? After reeling off a few statistics about Planned Parenthood today Dunham recalled that Sanger had ?aligned herself with eugenicists. ? ?It doesn?t seem to make sense? Dunham says. ?But way back in the early 20th century eugenics was an immensely popular social movement one with the kind of widespread legitimacy Margaret craved for her own birth control campaign. ? ?Let?s make something clear? Dunham adds. ?Racism and ableism do not have a place at Planned Parenthood and sure as hell don?t represent the organization?s commitment to equality. While there?s no question that Margaret left behind a conflicting legacy it?s also true that she was a champion of progress. ? The video discusses the invention of the birth control pill and the significance of 1973?s Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision before ending with a pledge to continue providing abortion care to women across the United States. ?In our first 100 years Planned Parenthood helped establish what reproductive rights are and why they?re so critically important? the video concludes. ?In the next 100 we will keep fighting until we make sure they?re available to everyone. ? Other celebrities lending their talent to the clip include Amy Schumer Tessa Thompson America Ferrera Jennifer Lawrence Gina Rodriguez and Constance Wu. J. J. Abrams is listed as an executive producer while Dunham?s boyfriend guitarist Jack Antonoff provided the music. Watch the clip above.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
132,26571,Mexico Ranked Second Deadliest Country in the World,Breitbart,Ryan Saavedra,5/10/2017,2017,5,,As the total number of conflict fatalities decreased around the world in 2016 the number of intentional homicides exploded in Mexico. [With 23 000 homicides in 2016 Mexico ranked as the second deadliest country in the world the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) revealed in their Armed Conflict Survey.  The report published on Tuesday highlighted the effect that drug cartels are having in Latin America. Leading the way are Mexico Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador: This assessment of violence in the region is based on more than numbers although the 39 000 people killed in Mexico Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador in 2016 indicate a security crisis much more complex and serious than most other countries in the region. Mexico?s 2016 intentional homicide total 23 000 is second only to Syria.   ?     In all four countries armed forces have been deployed for many years specifically to fight criminal gangs and in the case of Mexico transnational   cartels with   weapons and vast financial resources. In all four countries criminal groups have ambitious territorial claims: they fight amongst themselves and use arms to challenge the state directly for local control. Unlike traditional political conflicts these criminal conflicts are fought to establish autonomous territories not to pursue national   goals. 2016 marked the second consecutive year that the number of conflict fatalities decreased around the world CNN noted. Despite the decrease of 10 000 conflict fatalities from 2015 to 2016 Mexico?s homicide rate is accelerating: As the Armed Conflict Survey shows intentional homicides jumped by 22. 8% from 2015 to 2016. Violence continues to increase. The first two months of 2017 were the most violent January and February on record with 3 779 homicide cases registered by the authorities. The following month was even worse: March 2017 saw 2 020 murders. This was the highest monthly tally since June 2011 a bloody moment in the midst of Mexico?s ?war on drugs?. In December 2006 President Felipe Calderon deployed the armed forces to the streets with the mission of crushing the cartels. But the resulting conflict brought misery to Mexico: 105 000 people lost their lives in intentional homicides between that month and November 2012. Compounding the drug war is the corruption within the Mexican government. The organization that has the largest influence is the Sinaloa Cartel which the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) identifies as the largest and most prolific in the world. Court documents filed by the DOJ against Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin ?El Chapo? Guzman the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel state that corrupting government officials was the cornerstone of the cartel?s success Breitbart Texas reported. In the 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) reported ?Mexican TCOs [Drug Cartels] remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States no other group is currently positioned to challenge them. ? Despite the risk that Mexican drug cartels pose to the national security of U. S. many Democratic politicians and even some Republican politicians are opposed to building walls along the U. S.  Border. In April House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said ?The president I think talking about this wall is expressing a sign of weakness. He is saying I can?t control our borders I have to build a wall. ? Not to be outdone by Pelosi Sen. Dick Durbin ( ) said the proposed U. S.  Border wall was ?a political stunt. ?

133,26572,Facebook Adds Suicide Prevention Tools to Live Streaming - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,3/1/2017,2017,3,,Facebook has unveiled new features designed to help those with suicidal tendencies following a recent trend of suicides broadcast via Facebook Live. [Facebook?s new features will allow users to report specific content that they find worrying on Facebook Live streams. The person streaming will then be notified that others are worried for their safety and will provide the streamer with a set of resources aimed at preventing suicide and depression. These resources include the option to reach out to a friend contacting a suicide helpline and    guidelines on working through hard times.  Speaking to TechCrunch about the new features Facebook Researcher Jennifer Guadagno said ?Some might say we should cut off the livestream but what we?ve learned is cutting off the stream too early could remove the opportunity for that person to receive help. ? Facebook worked alongside the Crisis Text Line the National Eating Disorder Association and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the development of these new features this will allow those in danger to have immediate and direct contact with mental health professionals. Facebook worked alongside the Crisis Text Line the National Eating Disorder Association and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the development of these new features. This will allow those in danger to have immediate and direct contact with mental health professionals. Facebook Product Manager Vanessa   told TechCrunch ?What we heard from various people is any extra friction in someone reaching out for support can be the thing that stops them from getting support. We?re hopeful that having this as an additional way to connect to support reduces the friction. ? This seems to be Facebook?s response to a number of suicides which have been broadcast via the Facebook Live feature. Frederick Jay Bowdy an aspiring actor killed himself while recording a Facebook Live video earlier this week following his arrest on suspicion of sexual assault.    Naika Venant broadcast via Facebook Live from the bathroom of her Miami Gardens foster home fashioning a homemade noose from her scarf before the live feed ended abruptly.

135,26574,Rep. Phil Roe: House Healthcare Bill ?Giant Step? in Process of Replacing Obamacare,Breitbart,John Hayward,5/5/2017,2017,5,,Rep. Phil Roe ( ) talked about his vote in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday?s Breitbart News Daily. [Kassam observed that the Breitbart News Daily audience appeared to be leaning ?about 60 percent against? the AHCA because they do not see it as a full repeal of Obamacare or a bold enough step toward getting government out of the health insurance industry.  ?A yes vote was an obvious vote for me because the ACA is failing? said Roe referring to Obamacare by its legislative name the Affordable Care Act. ?A third of my district this coming year  ?   maybe more  ?   have no options whatsoever. We?re going to be an Obamacare desert in Tennessee within a year. There?s not going to be anywhere to buy insurance on the ACA. So it?s failed just like it has in Iowa just like it is in many places across the country. ?  ?The premiums have skyrocketed. The    have gone up. I?ll give you an example locally the hospital where I practiced for over 30 years? Rep. Roe who is a retired medical doctor who also served in the U. S. Army Medical Corps said. ?It?s a large system a   system: 9 000 employees 60 to 70 percent of the uncollectable debt are people with insurance  ?   not without insurance with insurance. Their   and    are skyrocketed and they can?t pay the bills. ? ?It wasn?t a matter of not doing anything? said Roe. ?The Republican Study Committee asked me two terms ago to write an alternative to the Affordable Care Act which I did and I did it again in the last Congress. We put our ideas out there. ? He said the implementation of those ideas was limited by congressional rules and the large number of votes required to pass a bill. ?I agree with people: if I?d have had my way and a magic wand this bill would have looked differently? he conceded. ?There would have been more free market principles in it. But we got as far as we could get and get the votes. ?  ?And by the way that vote would have been stronger  ?   we were five representatives short on our side yesterday? he added. ?We had five people one out for personal reasons and then four out in the Trump administration. People have forgotten that in the 2010 vote the Democrats had 257 not 237 and they passed it by five votes I believe. So it was a similar vote. Big things like this are hard to do. I understand people?s frustration that it didn?t go far enough. Believe me this was a giant step in my opinion  ?   positive not negative. ? Kassam asked about the AHCA?s potential to defund Planned Parenthood and whether such a provision has a chance of surviving in the Senate. ?We?ll have to see what the Senate does? replied Roe. ?My hat?s off to them. This is hard work. Look we spent hours and hours and hours getting to where we were getting to 216 votes with hiccups and starts. ? ?I am a   obstetrician? he declared. ?I?ve delivered almost 5 000 babies in my career before I retired and ran for Congress. Money from the federal government ought to go into health care. What we decided we have 141 federally qualified health centers that provide health care in the state of Tennessee and three Planned Parenthood clinics. So we want to put that money where health care is going on not abortions. ?  ?This was a   step. We?ll see what the Senate does. I think most of us are very happy about that Raheem? he said. Roe noted that Planned Parenthood provides services other than abortion. ?They do sexually transmitted disease screening. They do breast exams pap smears? he said. However he added ?I don?t think any of their clinics actually do mammograms. I think they refer those out. ? ?I know this was a big part for some people but a relatively small part of that whole package? he said of the Planned Parenthood funding issue. ?In the state of Tennessee  ?   I got this off of the Planned Parenthood website it?s not a number I?m making up  ?    they did 918 breast exams in 2016 in the three clinics in the state of Tennessee. I saw myself just one doctor between three and four thousand patients a year every year. ? Roe disagreed with the criticism that the AHCA merely does some ?tweaking? of Obamacare as Kassam put it rather than substantially repealing the ACA. ?Remember this is only the first part of this Raheem? Roe reiterated. ?This is all we could get in reconciliation meaning it just takes 51 votes in the Senate. Again I go back to the Senate rules. We were hamstrung because of what we could do. We passed already across state lines and association health plans. That?s already been passed over to the Senate. Now the Senate will filibuster that. ?  ?I?m not saying there are not ways you can get around it and do it. Remember we have a Secretary of HHS Tom Price who can also do a lot of things just executively with the stroke of a pen? he added.  ?What we?re trying to do  ?   and I did a terrible job of this when we first debated the healthcare bill  ?   this part of the market we?re talking about this individual and   market is seven percent of the entire insurance market? said Roe adding that ?160 million of us get our insurance through our employer. There are already ERISA protections in there for   conditions. There is no   exclusion if you have Medicaid which 74 million people do. ?  ?And by the way this is the first major reform of Medicaid in decades maybe since it was established? he continued. ?About 57 million people get insurance through Medicare where there is no   condition exclusion. What we tried to do was create a market in that seven percent to reconstruct the small market. It?s been destroyed by Obamacare. I mean we have well over a third of the counties in this country of the 3 000 or so counties in America that only have one choice and that?s going up every day. That market has been destroyed. This will help recreate it. ? Roe said there were other free   features of the Obamacare replacement bill worth praising such as the expansion of health savings accounts.  ?This is just the beginning? he promised. ?Look if I could have taken the bill I had written and passed it with 216 votes as written it would look different. We want to recreate a situation where doctors and patients are making choices not bureaucrats. ?  ?If we fail at this if we fail with making it where it?s cheaper where more people can buy insurance and the quality goes up then we will have failed. I admit that fully. I think we can hit those targets and I believe you can do that? he said. ?This is my third iteration of healthcare reform. I was involved in the Tenncare reform in the nineties in Tennessee which was a failure? Roe recalled. ?I wrote an editorial in 2010 Raheem about what I thought would happen to the ACA because of what I had seen almost 20 years before and it exactly came true. ?  Roe argued that Obamacare has failed according to its own standards and goals. ?It?s intention was to increase access and decrease costs. Well the costs have just gone through the roof. If we don?t do something with the cost of health care in this country nobody is going to be able to afford it? he warned.

137,26576,Delingpole: EPA?s Scott Pruitt Gets Eaten Alive by Fox - Breitbart,Breitbart,James Delingpole,4/2/2017,2017,4,,I just watched Scott Pruitt head of the Environmental Protection Agency get eaten alive by Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace. [Not only was it an ugly and painful sight but it was also a very dispiriting one.  Here is the guy who was carefully selected to be in the vanguard of President Trump?s war on the Green Blob which for decades has been doing untold damage to liberty the scientific method and the economy. And he can?t even answer a few basic and obvious questions about why the job he is doing is necessary important and right. Wallace asked him about the UN?s view that it was 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the   century is due to human activity. Pruitt sweated stuttered and floundered. Wallace asked him about NOAA?s claim that 2015 and 2016 are the hottest years on record. Pruitt had no convincing comeback. Wallace asked him the   question beloved by climate alarmists: ?What if you?re wrong? What if CO2 is causing dramatic climate change and we as humans are responsible?? Pruitt just didn?t know how to respond. There should have been nothing complicated or unexpected about these questions. They are the kind of thing any   decent interviewer might have asked be he a hostile one or a   Fox News one playing devil?s advocate. And if Scott Pruitt had had even the most cursory briefing and media training in his new role he should have been prepared for them. Not only should he have known the most effective answers to give but he should have been so confident in the rightness and truth of his cause that he should have been able to seize the moment and make the points that really need to be made about President Trump?s environmental policy: that it is being enacted for the good of science for the good of the economy and the core mission of Making America Great Again. How could Scott Pruitt not do this? Any one of us on the skeptical side of the argument could have pointed him to dozens of leading scientists  ?   and hundreds if not thousands of papers and articles  ?   that could easily have enabled Pruitt to say what needed to be said. He could have noted the incompetence corruption and mendacity of the heavily politicized IPCC the dishonest manipulation by organizations like NOAA  ?   indeed especially NOAA  ?   of the raw temperature data the utter meaninglessness of the ?hottest year evah? claims so often made in the liberal media. And he could easily have batted off the ?What if you?re wrong?? question by making perhaps the most important point of all that needs to be made about the ?war? on ?carbon?: that what it all comes down to is cost benefit analysis. To whit: the trillions of dollars being spent every year on the possibility that there might be a problem a) could be spent much more usefully elsewhere and b) are doing more harm than good. Pruitt was incapable of doing this though because trained lawyer though he is he is simply not on top of his brief. This is disgraceful. It?s an embarrassment and a shambles. Worst of all it?s an entirely needless concession to the enemy. See how it?s being reported by the   propaganda site Think Progress.

141,26580,China: Sean Spicer ?Not in a Position? to Call South China Sea ?International Territory? - Breitbart,Breitbart,Frances Martel,1/26/2017,2017,1,,The Chinese government has continued to protest the Trump administration?s repeated assurances it would oppose China?s ongoing colonization of international waters in the South China Sea most recently challenging White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling the waters in question ?international territory. ?[?I don?t think he [Spicer] is in a position to say that that?s international territory? Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told NBC News in an interview. ?There might be difference or controversial claims over the sovereignty of those islands but that?s not for the United States. That might be between China and some other countries in this region. ?  Lu?s remarks on bilateral relations with the United States were significantly sharper in tone than those of his boss Foreign Minister Wang Yi who said in recent remarks that Beijing?s Communist Party would like to ?increase mutual trust focus cooperation manage and control disputes and promote the healthy development of   relations to bring even greater benefits to both peoples. ? Spicer had said during his regular press briefing on Monday that the United States would play a role in protecting the territorial integrity of the South China Sea. ?If those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of China proper yeah we?ll make sure we defend international interests from being taken over by one country. ? Spicer?s comments appeared to irritate Chinese officials still objecting to remarks by incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about the region. In a Senate hearing otherwise largely devoid of definitive answers on major international disputes Tillerson vowed to play a role in protecting the interests of nations whose land and sea China claimed as its own in the region. ?We?re going to have to send China a clear signal that first the   stops and second your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed? he told a Senate committee comparing China?s usurpation of South China Sea territory to Russia?s invasion and colonization of Crimea. China claims the territory within a border Beijing refers to as the ?  line. ? Within that line is territory belonging to the Philippines Vietnam Taiwan Brunei and Malaysia as well as some waters close to Natuna Island Indonesia. China has constructed numerous artificial islands in the Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Scarborough Shoal challenging the sovereignty of the Philippines and Vietnam. China has filled some of those islands with military assets which the United States has repeatedly protested as threat to the international community. China?s official party line on the region appears to be that only the United States continues to protest their presence in waters not belonging to sovereign China. ?Countries have already come back to the original agreement that maybe for the time being we could set aside those sovereign disputes and focus on some joint developments and working together to maintain the peace and stability in this region? Lu told NBC. Lu appeared to mostly be referring to the Philippines which won a case at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague over China?s illegal construction but has since backed down of its objection to China?s territorial pursuits under President Rodrigo Duterte. His predecessor Benigno Aquino was the one to bring the case to the Hague. While the Trump administration appears to be making the liberation of the colonized South China Sea a priority President Barack Obama had also engaged China on the matter. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter attended military exercises in the region and often repeated the U. S. policy of having the American military ?fly sail and operate wherever international law allows. ? The Defense Department also staged numerous ?freedom of navigation? exercises in the region much to China?s chagrin. Critics argue however that the Obama administration?s guest passages through the South China Sea did not actively challenge China?s adverse possession claims on the artificial islands and as such were more of a ?PR stunt? than effective deterrence.

145,26584,Investigation Launched After Pig Heads Hung On Site of Future Mosque,Breitbart,Oliver JJ Lane,1/13/2017,2017,1,,The Dijon prosecutor has launched an investigation after a number of pig heads were hung on the gates of a building recently purchased by an Islamic association prior to its conversion to a place of worship. [Six   of pigs heads were discovered on the gates of the building in Genlis a small town near Dijon France on Friday morning. Further to the pig heads further ?cold cuts? of pork were discovered thrown into the yard.  France?s Le Figaro reports the comments of the local Mayor who said the Association of Socioculture and Muslim Culture of Genlis (ASCMG) had ?acquired this building with the aim of making it a place of worship in the future. This announcement made in the regional press last week had unleashed [bad feelings]?. The mayor told the paper he condemned the act of placing pig parts on the mosque and that he supported the work of the association. Speaking this morning he remarked: ?[The police] have taken samples and I hope the person or people of this act will be held accountable  ?     hatred linked to religion has no place in our commune where everyone must live in full harmony and respect for each other?.   Socialist politician Kheira Bouziane supported the mayor?s position remarking: ?The ASCMG has been promoting a peaceful   dialogue since 2013  ?     today?s insult aims to divide?.   activist group spokesman Maryna Schcherbyna joined the mayor in a call for punishment remarking this afternoon: ?SOS Racisme  ?     demands that justice be done?. She also referred to a 2016 case in the same town where the   Georges Grossel had called in a Facebook post for pork to be served in canteens. SOS Racisme demanded his resignation at the time  ?   he was suspended from the mayorality and fined ?2 000. Local broadcaster Le Bien Public reports the attack comes two days before a public consultation is due to be held on the project. The Dijon prosecutor has opened an investigation into what is being termed as a public provocation of discrimination or racial hatred although police presently have no leads to pursue. The Genlis case follows a significant number of other cases across Europe where Islamic centres of worship were defaced with pig parts. In Islam pigs and their meat are considered unclean or ?haram? and the leaving of bacon and other meat at mosques is considered a   and in some cases severely punished. Breitbart London reported in 2016 on the placement of a pig?s head on the steps of the office of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in protest against her policy of mass migration from predominantly Muslim countries. In November 2016 two Polish migrants were jailed in the UK for throwing rashers of bacon inside a mosque.

147,26586,China Slams Deployment of U.S. Carrier to South China Sea,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,2/21/2017,2017,2,,On Tuesday China slammed the United States? deployment of an aircraft carrier to conduct ?routine operations? in the South China Sea calling it a pretense to undermine its sovereignty. [?China always respects the freedom of navigation and overflight all littoral countries enjoy under international law? Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing according to Reuters.  ?But we are consistently opposed to relevant countries threatening and damaging the sovereignty and security of littoral countries under the flag of freedom of navigation and overflight? Geng said. ?We hope relevant countries can do more to safeguard regional peace and stability. ? China has built multiple islands in the sea and claims almost all its   waters  ?   although Brunei Malaysia the Philippines Taiwan and Vietnam all claim parts of it  ?   and about $5 trillion worth of trade passes through the sea each year. The U. S. has criticized China?s construction of the islands as well as a   of military facilities on the islands. The U. S. Navy sent the USS Carl Vinson along with its strike group through the South China Sea on Saturday to conduct ?routine operations. ? Prior to arriving in the South China Sea the strike group conducted training off the islands of Hawaii and Guam the Navy said. ?The training completed over the past few weeks has really brought the team together and improved our effectiveness and readiness as a strike group? said Rear Adm. James Kilby commander of the strike group. ?We are looking forward to demonstrating those capabilities while building upon existing strong relationships with our allies partners and friends in the    region? he said. The last time the Vinson deployed to the South China Sea was in 2015 to conduct a bilateral exercise with the Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force the Navy said in a statement. The Vinson first operated in the South China Sea in 1983 and has operated there during 16 previous deployments over its   history it added. Other U. S. ships have navigated the South China Sea last year to counter China?s claims of sovereignty but this deployment was the first under President Trump. The Vinson?s deployment to the area comes about two weeks after a Chinese aircraft that patrols the skies and detects threats flew within 1 000 feet of a U. S. surveillance aircraft. Pentagon officials had played that event down as unintentional. It also comes after a Navy plan was sent up to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to increase operations in the area although it?s not clear if it has been approved yet. The plan would see the U. S. conducting ?Freedom of Navigation Operations? or FONOPs within 12 nautical miles of the islands within what China claims is its territorial waters. Mattis signaled support for a potential increase in FONOPs during a press conference on Feb. 4 while in Japan. ?Freedom of navigation is absolute and whether it be commercial shipping or our U. S. Navy we will practice in international waters and transit international waters as appropriate? he said.
148,26587,Marvel Responds After Artist Allegedly Inserts Anti-Semitic and Christian References in X-Men Comic - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,4/10/2017,2017,4,,Marvel Comics was forced to issue an apology following the discovery of alleged   and   references in a recent issue of   by artist Ardian Syaf. [Indonesian artist Ardian Syaf allegedly inserted political and religious references in relation to the recent Indonesian election into the first issue of the new comic series   Gold. Syaf?s work on the comic reportedly featured a reference to the Koran verse Al Maidah 5:51 which urges Muslims not to take Christians and Jews as allies. The verse translates ?O you who have believed do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are in fact allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you  ?   then indeed he is one of them. Indeed Allah guides not the wrongdoing people. ?  The verse can be seen on the shirt of   character Colossus.  Hundreds of thousands of Muslims marched against the Christian governor of Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama after he criticized his political opponent?s reference to the verse. As a result many Muslims saw this as an act of blasphemy and called for the prosecution of Purnama. The comic also referenced the number 212 which is a direct reference to the protests held against Purnama on the December 2 last year. The same panel that features the number 212 also features the Jewish   character Kitty Pryde standing in the foreground.  Marvel Comics was quick to respond to concerns raised by those that noticed Syaf?s messages within the issue releasing a statement on the matter to Bleeding Cool. ?The mentioned artwork in   Gold #1 was inserted without knowledge behind its reported meanings? stated Marvel Comics. ?These implied references do not reflect the views of the writer editors or anyone else at Marvel and are in direct opposition of the inclusiveness of Marvel Comics and what the   have stood for since their creation. This artwork will be removed from subsequent printings digital versions and trade paperbacks and disciplinary action is being taken. ? Syaf declined to comment on the matter when questioned by Bleeding Cool but did reply to one fan who messaged him on Facebook. In the ensuing conversation Syaf did confirm that the numbers included within the comic were references to the current Indonesian political situation.    G.

The fact that Yoest will be replacing Kevin Griffis who now works for Planned Parenthood is another indication of the dramatic change we?ve seen in Washington since the election of President Trump. This is a new era for the   movement and our fight to protect unborn children and their mothers from the horror of abortion.

153,26592,Rep. Louie Gohmert: State Dept. Budget Cuts May Not Be Enough - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,3/18/2017,2017,3,,President Donald Trump released his 2018 budget proposal on Thursday revealing that the U. S. Department of State funding could be cut by 31 percent sparking outrage among mostly Democrats who say the cuts could put the country at risk. [Wendy Sherman under secretary of state for political affairs in the Obama administration told MSNBC?s Rachel Maddow on Thursday that Trump?s proposal to cut the State Department?s budget by a third would have ?implications? for  fighting terrorism and epidemics like Ebola. ?  But Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) said on Thursday at the Conversations with Conservatives Press Conference on Capitol Hill that given the agency?s priorities during the Obama administration the cuts might fall short. Gohmert said the cuts  ?   first reported as 28 percent but later clarified by the State Department as totaling 31 percent   ?   ?might not be enough. ? Gohmert cited the Obama administration?s priority at State of promoting homosexual rights around the world including encouraging nation states to change their laws regarding homosexuality and   marriage. On Jan. 11 the   rights publication the Washington Blade published a story entitled ?10 ways Obama promoted LGBT rights abroad. ? Those moves by the Obama administration?s State Department included: Mark Toner acting spokesman at State clarified on Thursday the proposed percentage of cuts at State. ?There?s a little bit of confusion about that so let me try to clarify it? Toner said. ?The FY 2018 budget requests 25. 6 billion in base funding for the Department of State and USAID and that?s a 10. 1 billion or 28 percent reduction from the FY 2017 continuing resolution level. ? ?So that?s a 28 percent reduction without the overseas contingency operations funding? Toner said. ?So the budget also requests obviously 12 billion as overseas contingency operations funding for a total request of 37. 6 billion which represents an overall reduction of 17. 3 billion. ? ?That?s 31 percent from the annualized  ?   or from the CR level which is base and OCO funds? Toner said. ?So just to simplify it the two variations there  ?   the 28 percent is the amount of reduction without OCO which is the overseas contingency operations funding. ? ?The 31 percent number or figure is with that overseas contingency operations funding? Toner said. The Los Angeles Times suggested in its reporting on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was not concerned with the budget cuts rather than characterizing his remarks as compatible with President Trump?s assessment that the Department has been overfunded in the past. ?But the head of the department Secretary of State Rex Tillerson seemed unconcerned Thursday? the Times reported. ?The level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking in the past  ?   and particularly in this past year  ?   is simply not sustainable? Tillerson said at a brief news conference in Tokyo the first stop on a     tour of Asia. ?Tillerson for most of his career a top executive at Exxon Mobil said he expected more aid from other countries would help to cover the shortfall as the U. S. recedes and he said he was ?confident? the State Department would continue to fulfill its mission? the Times reported. ?We are going to be undertaking a very comprehensive examination of how programs are executed a very comprehensive examination of how we are structured and I?m confident that with the input of the men and women of the State Department we are going to construct a way forward that allows us to be much more effective much more efficient and be able to do a lot with fewer dollars? Tillerson said. ?We understand the challenge? Tillerson said. ?I take the challenge that the president has given us on willingly and with great expectation that with everyone in the State Department?s assistance we?re going to deliver a much better result for the American people in the future. ?

A crowd of about 300 gathered for the ceremony. The memorial has been expanded each year. The memorial?s website explains: This is the nation?s first memorial dedicated exclusively to listing the names of all the fallen American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since 2003 a simple memorial for the country?s military fallen in Afghanistan and Iraq was set up in the Southern California city of Irvine by members of the community on the week before Memorial Day and then removed the week after Independence Day. For years the community and visitors from all over the country have come to share in the fellowship at the site of the Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial. The names of every service member who has died in Afghanistan and Iraq had been displayed on the wooden posts of the temporary memorial. Now their names are engraved in granite in a permanent memorial to assure that future generations of Americans will remember and honor them with gratitude as we do today. The panels carry the names of all those who died in Operation Enduring Freedom Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. One participant stressed the importance of helping those who died after they returned home through the ongoing challenge of veteran suicide.

Blum said. ?We don?t want people from outside of the first district. ? ?We don?t need people from Chicago there or Des Moines there or Minneapolis there? Blum said. ?I don?t represent them. ?They should go talk to their representatives at their town hall meetings? Blum said. ?I don?t know why they would want to be at my town hall meetings to start with. ? Instead of moving on to issues that face Iowans in Blum?s first district the reporter said the Congressman ?represents all Iowans? and shouldn?t they have a ?voice at the table?? After Blum explained that like voting people should participate in town halls based on where they live the reporter asked him if he would take a donation from a Republican in Iowa City which is not in Blum?s district. At that point Blum ended the interview calling the questions ?ridiculous? and saying that the he wouldn?t stand by and let the reporter ?badger? him. As Blum left the room children who accompanied him seemed to punctuate his departure with funny moves as the reporter tried to continue the interview. ?Let?s talk about the issues here? the reporter said to the empty chair.

160,26599,Donald Trump?s ?Comprehensive Immigration Reform? is Much Broader Than Expected - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,1/26/2017,2017,1,,The new immigration reforms announced Jan. 25 by President Donald Trump include a comprehensive range of measures that put the full weight of the federal government behind his campaign promise to shut down illegal immigration. [The extensive reforms of rules against illegal immigration were unpacked Wednesday afternoon by alarmed immigration lawyers including Greg Siskind and David Leopold a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The association?s members help bring roughly one million legal immigrants and roughly one million temporary contract workers into the United States each year.  Here?s a list of very important measures hidden in the details. For example immigration officers are being allowed the    ability to enforce the law as they see fit. Under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush the officers were merely robots under the slow and   control of D.  ?civil rights? lawyers whose first priorities were the political interests of their   political bosses. Trump?s Exec Order gives low level ICE bureaucrats unchecked power to declare someone an #immigration enforcement priority. Outrageous  ?   David Leopold (@DavidLeopold) January 25 2017  A Bloomberg columnist underlined the importance of the new freedom for officers. Ex Order on Sanctuaries may not budge local govts but makes every undoc immig a target for removal. Empowers   agents to judge.  ?   Francis Wilkinson (@fdwilkinson) January 25 2017    Garance is the    of Yahoo. com?s politics news service. She highlighted a report showing that the broader rules help immigration officers to send illegals home after committing common crimes such as identity theft. Thats very different from Obama?s policies which limited deportations to illegals who committed felonies or major violent crimes. Trump EO also dramatically expands ?criminal? category for purposes of deportation https:  .  pic. twitter.   ?   Garance   (@thegarance) January 25 2017  Siskind Tweeted his analysis of Trump?s orders section by section. Section 1 states that people who enter the US without inspection threaten  ?national security and public safety? .  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  This Tweet those that by declaring illegal immigrants to be national security threats Trump offers immigration agencies more legal pathways to quickly return the migrants to their homelands sometime bypassing civil lawsuits.   Section 3. Definitions. ot much interesting here except ?wall? is defined as a wall or a fence. Hah! ?operational control? means zero entries  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  That?s an important indication of support for a fence versus a wall. Border officers say a fence is better than a wall because it allows them to spot approaching problems through the fence. Also Trump?s decision to set?operational control? at zero means that zero illegal crosses is the desired and very ambitious measure of success.   c. project and develop   funding to build the wall including congressional budget requests (wait  ?   I thought Mexico was paying? ).  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  Okay by saying Congress will fund construction and staffing of the barrier Trump commits himself to finding other   funds to offset Congress? checks. Those funds could include taxes on money sent to Mexico by illegal immigrants or maybe even savings from welfare funds no longer being spent on illegal migrants.   Section 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. DHS will detain apprehended people until the outcome of their removal proceedings (already happens).  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  This detention requirement is huge because it means the end of President Barack Obama?s   ?catch and release? policy. The Obama policy has forced officers to release many migrants once they cross the border allowing the migrants to join their extended families throughout the United States. In contrast Trump?s plan will deter migrants who will know that if they are caught they must spend days or months in U. S. detention facilities before being sent home to face unpaid and angry coyotes.   Section 7. Return to Territory. DHS shall ensure people are returned 2 the place from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding if  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  That?s also big because it means that Trump will return migrants home until lawyers and perhaps courts decide if they can win asylum in the United States. That initial return will also deter migration because migrants will know they can?t get a job in the United States while their legal claims are processed over months or years.   Section 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. Agencies will review all sources of aid to Mexico over the last five years.  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  Here?s where Trump?s deputies are building more leverage against Mexico. By calculating where the aid money is going they?ll be able to nudge the Mexican government towards   payments  ?   or face the additional threat of losing aid funds.   Local law enforcement officials will have authority to perform the functions of immigration officers.  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  This is important too because it means the Justice Department can fund state and local cops to pick up illegal immigrants for repatriation by the Department of Homeland Security. This rule means that illegals living far from the border can now expect repatriation orders when they?re arrested for minors crimes such as   fights thefts and other offenses that have been ignored by deputies working for Obama and Bush.   Section 11. Parole Asylum and Removal. ?It is the policy of the exec branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently( )  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  This ?parole? rule shuts an   backdoor created by Obama?s deputies. Under Obama many illegals were given permission to return to the United States under ?parole? prior to taking a quick trip home. This early permission meant that the illegals  ?   including many students enrolled in American colleges  ?   could   the United States legally and then start applying for various forms of residency and amnesty.   DHS shall take actions to ensure asylum   fear screenings conducted in manner consistent w plain language of those provisions  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  This ?plain language? rule shuts down Obama?s   program for allowing Central American migrants into the United States. So far at least 350 000 unskilled Central American migrants have been allowed to apply by asylum by claiming they have a ?credible fear? of violence if they return home.   Sec. 16. Hiring. OPM will facilitate hiring to implement the order.  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  This hiring rule means that Trump?s top deputies will use of the White House?s Office of Personnel Management to pick the people tasked with enforcing the new policy. This   direction can help bypass bureaucratic opposition within various agencies. Officials have already announced the hiring of a D. C.    lobbyist to help run the Customs and Border Protection agency. ?Julie Kirchner the former executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has been named chief of staff at U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the largest federal law enforcement agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS)? said a Jan. 23 statement from the   Southern Poverty Law Center. The new rules also create a new office to help spotlight the suffering of Americans attacked by illegal immigrants. That p. r. office will provide a steady supply of news and drama to focus public attention on crimes by illegal immigrants  ?   and it will also help defeat claims by advocates of immigration that Trump is breaking up families of illegal immigrants. Trump presented the p. r. strategy at his Wednesday speech where he talked up his new rules. He told his cheering audience at the Department of Homeland Security that: For years the media has largely ignored the stories of Americans and lawful residents victimized by open borders. To all of those hurting out there I repeat to you these words. We hear you we see you and you will never ever be ignored again. As I travel the country I had the chance to get to know mothers who have lost their children to violence spilling over the border. I want to thank the Remembrance Project  ?   such incredible people  ?   for giving these families a voice. They are called Angel Mom?s for good reason because they are a voice to protect all of America?s children. Their children have not died in vain believe me. Pundits talk about how enforcing immigration laws can separate illegal immigrant families but the families they don?t talk about are the families of Americans. Forever separated from the people they love they don?t talk about that ever. As your president I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people. Overall Siskind Leopold and other advocates of   diversity say Trump?s popular reforms are a disaster for their political goals. That?s it. Now go out and let your legislators know this is terrible.  ?   (((Greg Siskind))) (@gsiskind) January 25 2017  The President is now in violation of his oath of office.  ?   David Leopold (@DavidLeopold) January 20 2017  However Trump has yet to announce many of the other labor and immigration reforms he promised during the election. Top of the list is a new law from Congress requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in the United States. The reformers also want Trump to deploy a   system so that officials know when legal visitors such as tourists or temporary workers have left the country. The system would help reduce the number of ?overstay? illegal workers. Congress has repeatedly authorized the deployment of the tracking system since the   atrocity but has not provided the needed funds. In 2015 roughly 500 000 foreign visitors overstayed their visas according to a government report. The reformers also want Trump to reverse Obama regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign   professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young American graduates. Trump is coming under criticism from   immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of   work permits given to roughly 750 000 illegal immigrants by Obama?s 2012  . Throughout his term Obama increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into the United States for every two births during the first half of 2016 according to the Center for Immigration Studies. For much of his tenure Obama?s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers even as 4 million young Americans annually entered the job market. By a lopsided margin most Americans believe companies should hire Americans before hiring additional immigrants. Trump?s   policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many GOP leaders especially House Speaker Paul Ryan. The GOP?s leadership tend to favor a       economic strategy. For example Ryan has repeatedly argued that business needs an extra supply of foreign   workers and   professionals above the natural supply of four million Americans who join the labor force each year and he argues that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for American workers. The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts? Americans salaries and effectively transfers roughly $500 billion a year from pay packets into investors? profits according to calculations by Professor George Borjas a Harvard researcher.

162,26601,Showdown! NFL MVP Matt Ryan Leads Falcons Against Tom Brady and the Patriots - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel Leberfeld,2/4/2017,2017,2,,Sports play as an escape from real world negativity. Unfortunately the sports and political worlds collide quite a bit recently. [Whatever your political persuasion the actual game on Super Bowl Sunday should prove fun to watch. Neither the cast of the Mike   musical Hamilton singing ?America the Beautiful? pregame nor   Lady Gaga performing the halftime show or commercials with political agendas can ruin a game featuring two great quarterbacks New England?s Tom Brady and Atlanta?s Matt Ryan.  Let?s take a closer look at the football game which likely plays as a nice   escape from political football. One of the great   in this contest features Ryan against a superb Patriots secondary: cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan along with safeties Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung. They all play on a high level. However the Patriots? secondary faces a Herculian challenge against the Falcons? coterie of   weapons led by wide receiver Julio Jones who averaged more than 100 receiving yards a game this season. If you take away Jones Ryan happily targets other talented wideouts such as Mo Sanu or speedy Taylor Gabriel or perhaps one of three talented tight ends. ?As a defensive coordinator you really have to pick your poison and decide what you want to take away? Jones said. And the poison includes a tailback tandem that can hurt you running and receiving. Atlanta?s dynamic duo of Davonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman combined for 2 482 yards and 24 touchdowns this season. This pair of powerful runners are passing game weapons as well combining for 85 receptions and 883 yards. The Patriots aren?t easy to run against with a cornucopia of talented massive defensive linemen such as Alan Branch and Malcolm Brown. ?They have big heavy guys up front that are ? said Falcons center Alex Mack. And Mack Atlanta?s outstanding center isn?t healthy. He?s dealing with a painful left fibula injury and will probably need a Toradol shot to get through the game. ?I?m concerned? Falcons coach Dan Quinn said about Mack. ?I?m not panicked but I?m concerned. ? With a   quarterback and a coterie of weapons the Falcons certainly shouldn?t struggle scoring but they can score enough? Can they keep up with the Brady? While Atlanta?s defense has improved from early in the season it?s still not an elite unit. In their regular season finale a   win over New Orleans Saints QB Drew Brees threw for 350 yards wide receiver Michael Thomas snagged 10 catches for 156 yards and tailback Mark Ingram rushed for 102 yards. After watching this tape Brady likely chomps at the bit. The Falcons start three defensive rookies  ?   safety Keanu Neal and linebackers De?Vondre Campbell and Deion Jones. They also feature a rookie nickel back Brian Poole who plays a lot. Brady is superb at manipulating defenders with his eyes  ?   throwing them off the trail of where he intends to throw. Rookies are particularly vulnerable to this chicanery. Expect Brady to target these rookies. ?Brady is going to find out what the kids know? said SiriusXM NFL Radio analyst Pat Kirwan. ?I would expect him to [go after the rookies]? said Neal. ?I would expect him to go to a guy that doesn?t have as much as experience as others. ? Neal embraces the challenge. ?Bring it on? Neal said. ?I?m not scared. ? Be careful what you wish for. Brady looking for his fifth Super Bowl victory is coming off a virtuoso performance vs. Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game throwing for 384 yards and three touchdowns. At 39 Brady is still at the top of his game and wants to play six more years. ?You combine his competitiveness his preparation his accuracy and his toughness with his memory you?ve got the best quarterback to ever play? Houston Texans coach Bill O?Brien a former Patriots assistant told the Boston Herald. A good way to mess with Brady is with interior pressure. ?The best way to disrupt [his] rhythm has always been pressuring Brady from the center of the pocket? Falcons coach Dan Quinn said. ?Many times when [pressure] comes from the edge he?s able to step up and find an extra [second] worth of time to find a free receiver. ? And blitzing Brady a lot isn?t a good idea. ?There isn?t a blitz I haven?t seen? said Brady a   NFL starting QB. The New York Giants beat him in a pair of Super Bowls (2007 and 2011) without blitzing. They relied on their front four to pressure him allowing them to drop seven guys into coverage. ?When you can affect him with a   rush it?s absolutely pivotal for our defense? said Falcons defensive tackle Tyson Jackson. ?You can drop more in coverage. ? Plus if you blitz you aren?t likely to get there the Patriots allowed only 24 sacks in the regular season. Aside from Brady?s greatness another problem for the Falcons  ?   they are sans their top cornerback Desmond Trufant on injured reserve. ?[The Falcons] will lose if their defense isn?t good enough? said retired coach Dick Vermeil. It probably isn?t. The pick here is New England.
163,26602,Mattis to NATO: Pay More or U.S. Will ?Moderate Its Commitment?,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,2/15/2017,2017,2,,Defense Secretary James Mattis on Wednesday issued an ultimatum to NATO while meeting with member nations for the first time in Brussels: Pay more or the U. S. will ?moderate its commitment? to the organization. [?I owe it to you all to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States and to state the fair demand from my country?s people in concrete terms? he said during a   meeting according to remarks provided to reporters traveling with him. ?America will meet its responsibilities but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to the alliance each of your capitals needs to show its support for our common defense. ?  During his presidential campaign President Donald Trump had repeatedly called on NATO members to pay more for their   in Europe. Only five of 28 member nations had met a requirement to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense: the United States the United Kingdom Estonia Poland and Greece. NATO members France and Germany currently spend 1. 78 percent and 1. 19 percent respectively according to the NATO figures. According to the Washington Post Mattis recalled that when he was NATO?s supreme allied commander of transformation from November 2007 to September 2009   Secretary Robert Gates warned NATO nations that America ?would lose their patience for carrying a disproportionate burden? of the defense of allies. Mattis said that impatience is now a ?governmental reality. ? ?No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of Western values? he added. ?Americans cannot care more for your children?s security than you do. Disregard for military readiness demonstrates a lack of respect for ourselves for the alliance and for the freedoms we inherited which are now clearly threatened. ? The meeting comes ahead of a visit to NATO by Vice President Michael Pence on Monday. Before the   meeting Mattis called NATO a ?fundamental bedrock. ? ?The alliance remains a fundamental bedrock for the United States and for all the   community? he said. During his confirmation hearing Mattis called the alliance ?the most successful military alliance probably in modern history maybe ever. ? His first calls to foreign counterparts included NATO members as well as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. But he also said in responses provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee in advance of the hearing ?member states must share the burden of common defense and meet or exceed the commitment to reach the two percent defense spending goal that their leaders set at the NATO summit in 2014. ?
164,26603,Video Shows Texas Dem Encouraging ?Sanctuary? Protesters from House Floor,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/9/2017,2017,6,,A new video captures a Texas Democrat encouraging protest disruptions from the floor of the State House of Representatives last week. The video was taken moments before the   confrontation between Republican Rep. Matt Rinaldi ( ) and Hispanic Democrat legislators. [The cell phone video taken from the floor of the Texas House by State Representative Mark Keough (  Woodlands) shows Democrat State Representative Ramon Ramero (  Worth) chanting ?Hey Hey. Ho Ho. SB4 has got to go!? House rules and order prohibit such behavior by representatives.   ?This is such an embarrassment for the legislature? Rep. Keough told Breitbart Texas in an exclusive interview. ?The people in the gallery were holding up signs saying they are in the country illegally and Democrat state reps are cheering them on. ? ?We all took the same oath to uphold and defend the Constitutions of Texas and the United States at the beginning of the session? the Republican representative continued. ?And here they were encouraging lawless behavior. ? Keough told Breitbart Texas that House rules expressly prohibit this type of conduct. ?Unfortunately the House    and other security personnel were upstairs in the gallery dealing with the disruptive crowd? he explained. ?When the Speaker calls for order you are supposed to settle down but they just continued encouraging the crowd. I couldn?t believe it. ? The chants from protesters came after the House Speaker had ordered Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers to clear the House Gallery of protesters who were attempting to disrupt the final day of the legislative session. Romero and other Democrat state representatives were seen by their Republican colleagues as egging on the protesters while law enforcement officers tried to maintain peace and order. State Representative Jonathan Stickland ( ) told Breitbart Texas that at this point when the video by Keough was filmed several DPS troopers had been assaulted and pushed down the steps in the gallery by the crowd. ?These troopers were trying to restore order and Democrats were egging them on from the floor? Stickland said. ?I have never seen anything like this in the House. ? Rinaldi would later accuse Romero of physically assaulting him after he told Democrat reps he had called ICE on the protesters claiming to be illegal aliens. ?When I told the Democrats I called ICE Representative Ramon Romero physically assaulted me and other Democrats were held back by colleagues? Rinaldi posted on Facebook. This session has seen the passage of historic but emotional legislation relating to prohibiting sanctuary cities in Texas. Senate Bill 4 authored by Senator Charles Perry ( ) is now the law of the state. The law which prohibits sheriff?s and police chiefs from ignoring immigration detainers and having policies forbidding officers from asking about immigration status becomes effective on September 1 2017. The bill provides civil fines and even criminal penalties to law enforcement officials choosing to ignore immigration authorities. This new law was the focus of protesters on the final day of the session. The emotional debate over the bill left emotional scars on relationships between representatives with opposing viewpoints. In a few weeks the legislature will reconvene in a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott on July 18.

Megyn Kelly. [After Kelly?s controversial and   interview with Alex Jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 Minutes and America?s Funniest Home Videos New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday that NBC is trying to unload Kelly and convince Fox News to take her back.  But a   Fox News source told Breitbart News that there is ?no way? Kelly could come back to the network. Quite simply the source told Breitbart News Kelly ?would not be welcomed back. ? Inside scoop:  NBC now trying to get rid of Megyn Kelly. Even trying to get FOX to buy out her contract and take her back.  ?   MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19 2017  Simone also suggested that if Kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more ?NBC will have to take her off the network? and ?if they are stuck with her they?ll give her an MSNBC show. ? NBC will have to take her off the network  ?   if they are stuck with her they?ll give her an MSNBC show  ?   MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19 2017  Before she bolted to NBC Kelly anchored The Kelly File on Fox News. During the 2016 election cycle Kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the first Republican presidential debate in August of 2015 in Cleveland Ohio. She also gave ?Never Trumpers? a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam Trump throughout the election cycle. And as the Daily Beast?s Lloyd Grove noted Kelly also ?hastened [Roger] Ailes? forced resignation last July with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st Century Fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. ? New York magazine?s Gabriel Sherman reported that Kelly ?told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox. ? As Grove pointed out Kelly in her book said there was some ?poetic justice? in the role she played in helping boot Ailes out of Fox News. ?I worked my tail off  ?     I established myself as a serious person? Kelly wrote. ?I built my own power. And when the allegations against Roger hit I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that. ? NBC reportedly invested nearly $20 million a year to bring Kelly to the network and NBC?s investment has not paid any dividends at all. After her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin Kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. And when HuffPost obtained the full unedited interview in which a ?nervous? Kelly lobbed Putin ?softballs? Kelly was subjected to another round of criticism. Her interview with Jones did not have any news value and may have damaged NBC?s and her reputation more than it helped. Advertisers like J. P. Morgan Chase fled while Kelly lost credibility in the eyes of many when in a leaked recording that Jones released Kelly is heard telling Jones ?It?s not gonna be some gotcha hit piece I promise you that. ? NBC did not help matters when it released a photo of Kelly and Jones that as The Hill?s media columnist Joe Concha described looked ?like they were on a Tinder date pulling up to a  . ? Yet despite all of the hype Kelly?s interview with Jones still flopped. 60 Minutes and America?s Funniest Home Videos reruns even beat Kelly?s show by nearly 40 percent in the coveted 18 to    demographic as Concha noted. A television executive told CNN over the weekend that NBC?s ?fundamental mistake? was thinking that Kelly was actually a ?superstar. ? NBC executives have already reportedly determined that viewers are not going to tune in to Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly just to watch Kelly and are ?freaking out? over the ?ratings disaster? that is Kelly.

Donald Trump?s first act as president will reportedly be to ?clamp down? on the country?s immigration system and refugee resettlement program while enforcing a ? ? method focusing on skilled workers. [In a new piece by the LA Times the   newspaper says Trump will immediately focus on the broken immigration system both legal and illegal just as his campaign for president promised:  Gone will be the temporary protections of the final Obama years for people in the country illegally.

The LA Times cites Trump spokesman Sean Spicer?s statement on immigration as an indication that the incoming administration will not take a backseat to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the issue. ?We need to get control of our borders and we need to get control of our immigration system and we can do it in a very smart and methodical way that ensures that the priority is first and foremost people who seek to cause us harm or who are a danger in a community? Spicer told the LA Times. The LA Times also noted Trump?s widespread powers as president over the country?s immigration system writing that ?Trump can act on immigration without Congress?: Taken together the actions would result in a significant shift in how immigration law is enforced which could itself create a ripple effect that alters the immigration pool and how the 11 million or so in the U. S. illegally live their lives. Unlike some of his other   plans such as replacing Obamacare Trump can act on immigration without Congress under the president?s wide legal authority to control borders. ?We?re going to move very quickly on the border? Vice   Mike Pence told NBC News on Wednesday saying Trump could even use his executive power to start on his chief immigration pledge  ?   building a wall along the border with Mexico. That   on immigration could come via a   immigration system which would mean less   immigrants and more   workers to take jobs that cannot be filled from the country?s native population POLITICO reported. ?We?re going to have great people and people of great talent coming into our country? Trump said in an interview with Fox  Friends. ?And if you can think of this some of the Silicon Valley companies want to build up in Canada because in Canada they?re able to get the people that they need and they can?t get them in this country because we don?t allow them in this country. ? ?So we?re going to take care of a lot of situations? Trump continued referring the country?s immigration system. ?And we?re going to have a lot of heart believe me. It?s going to be a heart almost as big as yours. ? The   immigration plan could be trotted out by the incoming Trump administration ?over the next two to three months? as he noted in the interview. Immigration groups like NumbersUSA heralded the potential   system saying that it would favor giving legal immigrant residence to individuals who fill jobs rather than the current system which favors family members of immigrants already living in the U. S. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.

[From the Hollywood Reporter:  If Donald Trump gets his way on tax reform Hollywood actors directors and writers stand to be among the biggest beneficiaries. Understanding why takes some appreciation of the fact that the entertainment industry isn?t just five big corporations but also thousands of smaller ones  ?   almost all incredibly obscure even if their owners are quite famous. As the tax code currently stands the richest individuals pay almost 40 percent on individual income (or less after deductions). Businesses pay a separate rate which Trump wishes to set at 15 percent. Most importantly the proposal outlined by the Trump Administration has this latter rate being applied to all businesses including ? ? organizations like S corporations that distribute a salary to   and count the rest as profits. Under the current law personal income and business income is taxed roughly the same but if Trump succeeds many folks may aim to establish   for themselves to get their taxes down to 15 percent. Guess what? Many in Hollywood are largely set up already thanks to ? ? corporations that contract out services like acting and directing to production studios. Alas alongside the 21st Century Fox?s and Time Warner?s come Kaling International (Mindy Kaling) Kimsaprincess Inc. (Kim Kardashian) Snooker Doodle (Emily Deschanel) Rogue Marble (Sylvester Stallone) and so forth.   ?       Read Gardner?s full column at the Hollywood Reporter.

171,26610,Left Wing Activists Disrupt Rep. Dave Brat?s Town Hall ? ?You Lie? - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,5/10/2017,2017,5,,Rep. Dave Brat ( ) faced unending interruptions at a town hall meeting in Richmond on Tuesday night. [Before Brat could even speak the crowd chanted ?read our questions? and repeatedly yelled out ?you lie? as he tried to make his remarks.  ?I?m trying to listen to the people on the key issues of our day? Brat yelled over the continuous heckling. ?If we go this route it?s going to be very hard to have rational civil discourse all night. ? ?I?m trying my best here? Brat said in a video of part of the town hall that was posted on YouTube. When Brat tried to explain how the American Health Care Act passed by the House last week would cover   conditions people booed and tried to shout him down. Activists cheered when someone asked about Trump?s tax returns and about why the Congressional Budget Office had not scored the GOP health care bill before it was voted on. Brat said he agreed a score was needed but he was still jeered by people in the audience some dressed in   that read ?RESIST? and others showing support for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. The Associated Press reported the town hall this way: ?Critics of Republican U. S. Rep. Dave Brat and the House health care bill he voted for packed a raucous town hall meeting in his Virginia district Tuesday night booing and shouting down the congressman from start to finish. Brat is the latest in a series of lawmakers across the country who have gotten an earful from constituents at town hall meetings since last week?s passage of the House health care bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. ? ?Hundreds of people packed the suburban Richmond church for the meeting Brat   with a Republican state senator and dozens of protesters lined up outside ahead of its start many of them holding signs shaped like tombstones. Inside opponents appeared to far outnumber supporters. ? Much of the town hall focused on the American Health Care Act which passed last week on a   vote in the House with Brat voting for it. But Brat like other members of the Freedom Caucus opposed the first version of the act and only came on board this round after the   amendment was added to allow states to obtain a waiver to avoid some Affordable Care Act regulations. Brat was also asked about Trump firing FBI Director James Comey and whether he would push for a special prosecutor to investigate any ties the president might have with Russia. Brat said he would not and added ?In this country you are innocent until there?s evidence. ?And this applies to all of you right?? Brat said. ?No one wants the federal government coming after you unless there is evidence and no one can stand up and give me the evidence. ? 
172,26611,DNI: Insiders Leaking ?Classified? Information ?a Significant Threat? Under Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,5/15/2017,2017,5,,WASHINGTON DC  ?   The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has warned that deliberate leaks of ?sensitive or classified? U. S. government information by ?trusted insiders? will ?remain a significant threat? during President Donald Trump?s tenure. [DNI Daniel Coats? warning can be found in the latest World Wide Threat Assessment unveiled during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last week.  ?Trusted insiders who disclose sensitive or classified US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2017 and beyond? notes the assessment authored by the U. S. intelligence community. ?The sophistication and availability of information technology that increases the scope and impact of unauthorized disclosures exacerbate this threat. ? What Coats describes sounds similar to what has come to be known as the ?deep state? which refers to entities within and outside the federal government colluding to prevent a democratically elected leader from implementing his agenda. Breitbart News reported: The term ?deep state? has been used to refer to deliberate leaks designed to undermine the president but also to the willing collusion of elements of the mainstream media the latent distrust and suspected opposition of elements of the intelligence services but also the willing resistance of certain career civil servants in the agencies charged with carrying President Trump?s directions to fruition. Specifically the primary purpose of the ?deep state is to undermine a democratically elected leader?s agenda and ultimately overthrow that leader. A ?deep state? is primarily powered by a steady drip of classified information much like what has been taking place under the Trump administration. Nevertheless various mainstream media outlets have dismissed the existence of an American ?deep state? working against the Trump administration as a conspiracy theory. The ?deep state? involves an intricate network comprised of government insiders often made up of individuals from the military and intelligence communities. Many media outlets described concerns voiced by President Trump and his supporters about the intelligence community and other components of the government leaking classified information as paranoia. Through the threat assessment the intelligence community itself is warning that the disclosure of classified information by ?trusted? government insiders is not only real but also poses a ?significant threat. ? The Worldwide Threat Assessment also warns against foreign actors including some from Latin America seeking to infiltrate the U. S. government. It reports: The United States will face a complex global foreign Intelligence threat environment in 2017. We assess that the leading state intelligence threats to US interests will continue to be Russia and China based on their services? capabilities intent and broad operational scope. Other states in South Asia the Near East East Asia and Latin America will pose local and regional Intelligence threats to US interests. For example Iranian and Cuban intelligence and security services continue to view the United States as a primary threat. Penetrating the US national decision making apparatus and the Intelligence Community will remain primary objectives for numerous foreign intelligence entities. Additionally the targeting of national security information and proprietary information from US companies and research institutions involved with defense energy finance   technology and other areas will remain a persistent threat to US interests. Besides foreign governments like Russia and China   criminals will also seek to undermine America?s intelligence community by recruiting American government insiders to obtain information and conduct surveillance. ?  entities including international terrorists and transnational organized crime groups are likely to continue to employ and improve their intelligence capabilities including by human technical and cyber means. As with state intelligence services these   entities recruit sources and perform physical and technical surveillance to facilitate their illicit activities and avoid detection and capture? points out the threat assessment. In 2016 the threat assessment also warned that ?insiders who disclose sensitive US Government information without authorization will remain a significant threat in 2016. ?
173,26612,CLAIM: Just Mentioning Brexit Causes Hate Crime Parliament Committee Told,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,1/12/2017,2017,1,,Politicians encourage hate crimes by discussing Brexit and formally triggering the process will bring   attacks to ?another level? MPs have been told. [Polish community leaders claimed the aspects of Britain that migrants like best its ?culture of tolerance? and ?diversity? have been shattered since the Brexit vote because people have been emboldened to carry out verbal and physical attacks against migrants.  ?Every statement and every political activity around Brexit negotiations brings a spike in inquiries to our organisation. We expect when article 50 is triggered it will bring another level of discontent? Barbara Drozdowicz of the East European Resource Centre (EERC) told the Commons Home Affairs Committee. Ms. Drozdowicz fingered criticism of mass migration as a driver of ?hate? in response to a question by fierce Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna. The Labour MP pointed to ?Leave. EU UKIP obviously? when he asked the EERC director whether she believes the ?Leave campaign? and   figures ?bear a responsibility? for   attacks. ?The campaign was built on controlling migration. ?Controlling migration? is not a neutral term? she told MPs. When Conservative David Burrowes noted that most examples of ?hate? are expressed online community leaders admitted they?ve neither seen nor had reports of content on the internet that?s abusive to migrants from Europe. Tadeusz Stenzel the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain suggested there might be a language barrier which prevents European migrants from being able to understand abusive posts and report them. MPs heard that European migrants began reporting ?hate crimes? in around April of last year as the referendum campaign got into gear but that only after Britons voted to leave the European Union (EU) was the resource centre inundated with an ?explosion of calls?. Ms. Drozdowicz said migrants from Eastern Europe reported being told to ?go home? and hearing ?casual hate speech? on public transport and that the centre heard about violent incidents including a Polish child being beaten up at school. Chairman of the committee Yvette Cooper said the details of incidents that were talked about in the session were ?appalling?. ?Hate crime is appalling   and should have no place in our country? she said. Heading the government?s inquiry into ?hate crime? in November Ms. Cooper accused the campaigns of both Leave during the EU referendum and Donald Trump in the U. S. presidential race of having incited hatred.
174,26613,?Insecurity? Drives Soaring Number of Belgians to Apply for Gun Licenses - Breitbart,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,1/3/2017,2017,1,,The number of Belgians applying for firearms permits has skyrocketed with applications in one major province more than doubling in just five years according to the authorities. [?The trend is clear the number of applications we?ve received for gun licenses has more than doubled in five years? said Divisional Commissioner of the province of Lige Thierry Brasseur.  The number of applications has steadily risen each year jumping 117 per cent from 2010 when 608 permits were requested to 1 318 in 2015 Explaining that the trend looks set to continue the commissioner revealed that the province received 1 436 new applications in the last year to December. Lige?s Service of Arms the state body in charge of granting gun licenses in the province hinted that rising crime and terror attacks in Europe are what?s fueling the ?extraordinary enthusiasm? with which Belgians are lining up to buy firearms. Speaking at a recent symposium the department noted that ?The explanation may lie in the current security context which generates feelings of insecurity among the population? the department told a recent symposium. Another major contributor to Belgians? anxiety Le Soir reports is the frequency which which burglaries and home invasions are taking place  ?   180 a day in 2015 in the country of less than 11. 5 million people. Firearms permits are tightly controlled in Belgium where they are only issued after the authorities conduct a ?morality investigation? into applicants who also have to pass a theoretical and practical test. Strict rules are in place for gun owners too as it?s forbidden to leave the house with a firearm unless it?s carried from there the the shooting club in a locked case. At home the law states that guns must also be kept in a safe. At the symposium in Lige participants were informed that soaring gun ownership has had no impact on crime which has remained stable since 2015. ?The problem is not people who have declared weapons and who are legally entitled to hold them. The real problem is the others? said Christophe Baes the district commissioner of Walloon Brabant where gun permit requests jumped 20 per cent from 2015 to 2016. Following a series of tough gun control measures affiliation to a sports shooting club has become the least complicated legal way to apply for a license. In Lige 80 to 90 per cent of the new requests concern sports shooting. A similar trend can be seen in France where shooting clubs have welcomed an additional 50 000 licensees since 2011 according to a survey by L?Obs  ?   an increase of almost 40 per cent  ?   which has been reinforced a spate of terror attacks in the country. ?Before the beginning of 2015 it was only a vague trend. Since the ?Charlie Hebdo? Bataclan and Nice attacks [gun license requests] have become a growing phenomenon. In the climate of psychosis that crosses the country where there are real threats of terrorism multiple insecurities and sometimes fantasies of all kinds several indicators show that an increasing number of French people are seeking to arm themselves? France?s biggest news and information weekly noted. In the wake of mass sex attacks by migrant mobs in Cologne on New Year?s Eve 2016 major German cities all reported an influx of requests for weapons permits. Cologne police estimated that they received at least 304 applications within just two weeks of the mass sexual assaults. In 2015 the city?s police force saw just 408 applications total over the entire year.

[Jacob Ewing is accused of replicating scenes from seven porn videos he watched when he allegedly raped two women. A judge ruled that the videos are permitted to be used as evidence in his trial the Kansas City Star reported.  ?Apparently portions of the videos depict acts that [Ewing] is said to have replicated himself upon the witnesses? Jackson County District Judge Norbert Marek wrote in his ruling. ?The relevance of this evidence could prove motive intent preparation plan knowledge or identity. ? Ewing ?chose video after video? of women being raped or assaulted which investigators say they discovered when they looked through his online browsing history prosecutor Jacqie Spradling wrote in court documents. Ewing allegedly raped one woman in September 2014 and another in May 2016. Court papers describe how Ewing watched the violent porn videos within 45 days of the second rape he allegedly committed. Spradling filed a motion that said there is evidence that Ewing watched four hours of violent porn a day on average including scenes where women were strangled and forced to eat vomit the Topeka   reported. Ewing?s attorney said the footage is ?highly highly prejudicial? against her client and argued that the footage should not be used as evidence. Ewing faces multiple charges including rape aggravated sodomy and battery. Marek previously declined a motion for similar evidence to be used against Ewing in a trial last month where Ewing was acquitted of a separate case involving the sexual assault of a    girl. Ewing faces multiple trials for separate sexual assault cases scheduled in June August and October. He remains in jail but pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.

Claim Raises More Questions - Breitbart,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,3/4/2017,2017,3,,A number of   officials appear to suggest that the Obama administration may have actually wiretapped the Trump campaign but that if they did it would have been justified by a court and part of an investigation by the Justice Department ?  not led by or ordered from the White House or the former president himself. [On Saturday former President Obama?s spokesman Kevin Lewis denied that the former White House or the former President himself would have given such an order to wiretap Trump Tower ?  or any other type of surveillance in any case ?  but that such an order would have come from an ?independent investigation led by the Department of Justice. ?  ?A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice? Lewis said. ?As part of that practice neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U. S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. ? Lewis? statement on the former president?s behalf came in response to the explosive charges from President Donald Trump who tweeted on Saturday morning that the Obama team conducted surveillance on Trump Tower during the campaign and afterward. Valerie Jarrett another close Obama aide also tweeted the statement from former President Obama?s spokesman Lewis. Jarrett is according to the U. K.

David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) March 4 2017  In other words these   officials are subtly confirming the accuracy of the reporting ?  that the Obama administration did in fact conduct surveillance on Trump Tower in October and   and that the administration originally sought a warrant back in the summer of 2016 ?  but they say the president himself and the Obama White House was not involved in the decision. What?s more Philip Rucker the White House bureau chief at the Washington Post says the same thing as these former Obama officials: That the Obama spokesman?s statement does not deny the existence of wiretaps on Trump Tower only that Obama himself and the Obama White House did not approve them if they did exist. The Obama statement does not say there was no federal wire tapping of Trump Tower. It only says Obama and White House didn?t order it.  ?   Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) March 4 2017  The outrage from the media and the Democrats appears to be standard hatred of Trump. The president forced a set of facts into the news cycle that was already previously public but framed in a way that puts his political opponents and the establishment media on the defensive. This appears to be the calculus: either the wiretaps exist as Trump suggests and the president will use them to bludgeon the Obama administration and the media for impropriety and overreach or there were no wiretaps which suggests the previous administration had no reason to suspect Trump colluded with a foreign government.
178,26617,Hamas Refuses to Turn in Islamic State Loyalists to Egypt ,Breitbart,Ali Waked,1/28/2017,2017,1,,Hamas has turned down Egypt?s request to extradite detained jihadists who have been involved in insurgency against the Egyptian army a Hamas official told Breitbart Jerusalem. [Hamas? deputy diplomatic leader Mousa Abu Marzouk and former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh met with Egyptian military officials this week.  ?Extraditing jihadists to Egypt would send significant shockwaves across the Gaza Strip and will create a backlash among Hamas loyalists most notably its military wing operatives? a Hamas official told Breitbart Jerusalem. He said the fate of the jihadists detained by Hamas was a central part of the negotiation between the two parties and the main impediment to progress in an overall positive process of rapprochement with Egypt. ?Haniyeh and Marzouk gave all the information they had about Islamic State loyalists in the Gaza Strip including some specific names that the Egyptians raised? he said. ?They also pledged that they?ll pass on any information their interrogation may yield. But extradition remains a bone of contention. ? He said that security arrangements across the border to prevent the movement of militants between Sinai and Gaza have been discussed as well as the establishment of a joint force. He failed to disclose any further details about this. Meanwhile Hamas has continued to loosen its grip on IS sympathizers in Gaza. A Gaza jihadi affiliated with IS ideology said that for the first time in almost a year Hamas has allowed detainees to be visited by their families. Abu Baker Almuhajer surmised that Hamas is hoping to persuade Welayat Sinai IS?s Egyptian affiliate to send a weapons shipment it has delayed. Speaking to Egyptian journalists in Cairo Marzouk said that Hamas ?turned over a new leaf with Egypt and no longer shelters anyone who may be a risk to Egypt?s national security. ? He said Hamas? relationship with Egypt was better than it had ever been and that the Egyptian judiciary had failed to link Hamas to attacks against Egyptian targets. ?Currently there are no more outstanding issues between us and our Egyptian brothers? he said. ?We received from them a wanted list comprising very few names and we?ll discuss each of them individually. ?

Breitbart has also published evidence highlighted by critics showing that CAIR was named an unindicted   in a   criminal effort to deliver $12 million to the   HAMAS jihad group that CAIR was founded with $490 000 from HAMAS and that the FBI bans   meetings with CAIR officials. ?

180,26619,Van Jones at University of Chicago: Safe Spaces Are a ?Terrible Idea? - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,2/25/2017,2017,2,,Speaking at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics CNN contributor Van Jones condemned campus safe spaces calling them a ?terrible idea. ?[  At an event hosted by former Obama staffer David Axelrod who serves at the Institute of Politics? Director Van Jones was asked about the increased demand from students for protection from ideas on college campuses. ?There are two ideas about safe spaces. One is a very good idea and one is a terrible idea. The idea of being physically safe on campus not being subjected to sexual harassment and physical abuse or something like that. Being targeted specifically  ?    Hey I?m perfectly fine with that? Jones claimed. ?But there is another view that is now I think ascendent  ?     It?s a horrible view which is that ?I need to be safe ideologically I need to be safe emotionally I just need to feel good all the time. And if someone else says something that I don?t like that is a problem for everyone else including the administration? he continued. Jones suggested that safe spaces from ideas contradict the purpose of a university education: ?I think that?s a terrible idea for the following reason: I don?t want you to be safe ideologically. I don?t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That?s different. I?m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots and learn how to deal with adversity. I?m not going to take the weights out of the gym. That?s the whole point of the gym. You can?t live on a campus where people say stuff that you don?t like??

182,26621,Christians in 2017 ?Most Persecuted Group in the World?,Breitbart,Thomas D. Williams Ph.D.,4/16/2017,2017,4,,In many parts of the world Christians gathering to celebrate Christ?s resurrection do so with the knowledge that any day their faith could cost them their lives as it has for thousands of their brothers and sisters. [On Palm Sunday twin bombings by jihadists at two Egyptian churches killed at least 45 worshippers and wounded more than 100 others in the latest of a long string of deadly attacks targeting Christians throughout the world.  The attacks were directed specifically to Christian in their houses of worship to avoid any ambiguity regarding the intent. As has been noted this was ?an attack on Christians simply because they are Christians. ? On Saturday the Pakistan military said it has thwarted a ?major terrorist attack? against Christians planned for Easter Sunday after a successful overnight raid just hours after Christians celebrated Good Friday services. On Easter Sunday 2016 an Islamist militant took the lives of more than 70 people and injured over 320 more after detonating his suicide vest in a park in Lahore that was full of Christian families celebrating the feast. Among the victims are more than 30 small children who at the time of the blast were playing sports and outdoor games in the    Park. During the last calendar year some 90 000 Christians were killed for their faith across the globe making Christians by far the most persecuted group in the world according to a study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR). The director of CESNUR Dr. Massimo Introvigne told Breitbart News that whereas atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians in the last century ?Islamic  ? has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. The Center?s findings corroborate those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 ?World Watch List? for example published by the Open Doors organization nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer ?extreme persecution? had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. Their 2016 report revealed that ?Islamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine? of Christians in the world today and that ?40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution. ? During the year nearly   of the Christians killed for their faith were executed at the hands of Islamic extremists such as the Islamic State or Boko Haram. While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith Introvigne said they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. Along with the enormous number of deaths a great many more Christians ?  as many as 600 million ?  were prevented from practicing their faith in 2016. On Easter 2015 Pope Francis reminded the world that there are more Christian martyrs in the present age than even in the first centuries when the Roman Empire attempted to eliminate all followers of the nascent religion. Calling for ?tangible help in the defense and protection of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted exiled killed and beheaded just for being Christians? Francis told a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter?s Square that today?s martyrs ?are more numerous than in the first centuries. ? Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome
183,26622,LAPD?s ?Knock Knock? Task Force to Protect Celebrity Homes - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,3/12/2017,2017,3,,The LAPD has officially launched a ?Knock Knock? Burglary Task Force in an effort to stop   targeted burglaries of celebrity homes. [The name ?Knock Knock? is derived from the tactic the gangs use to burglarize the homes. They reportedly form small groups of three or four one of whom knocks on the front door of the home. If no one answers  ?   giving the impression that no one is home  ?   the gang member who knocked on the door signals the others and they seek entry through doors and windows around the home.  According to the   Daily News the home of the Los Angeles Lakers? Nick Young was targeted on ?February 18 or 19? with thieves taking cash and other valuables worth approximately $500 000. Former Lakers player Derek Fisher was also targeted with thieves taking cash jewelry and other goods worth approximately $300 000 from his Tarzana home. KTLA reported that the burglary of Young?s home occurred ?the same weekend the NBA was hosting its   Game festivities in New Orleans. ? Young was in New Orleans for the event competing in the contest for   shooting. No one was home when the ?knock knock? burglars struck. The homes of singers Alanis Morisette and Nicki Minaj were also hit. The New York Daily News reports that Minaj?s home was ?robbed of approximately $200 000 worth of items. ? Suspects also destroyed property in Minaj?s home and cut up some of her clothes. The San Fernando Valley Knock Knock Task Force consists of roughly 30 officers divided among ?surveillance teams undercover detectives and patrol cars working to prevent and curb such incidents. ?

187,26626,?The Most Trusted National Leader Today?: 80 Percent of Filipinos Have ?Much Trust? in Duterte,Breitbart,Frances Martel,5/8/2017,2017,5,,A national poll released Monday showed Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte?s popularity holding steady with 80 percent of respondents saying they have ?much trust? in the controversial strongman. [The Social Weather Stations (SWS) polling occurs after every annual quarter this poll taken between March 25 to 28 but published Monday. The SWS poll found that ten percent of the 1 200 respondents had ?little? trust in Duterte and another nearly 11 percent were undecided. Reuters notes that this represents a   drop from his   ?much trust? approval rating in December 2016. Throughout the entirety of SWS?s tracking of Duterte  ?   since December 2015  ?   Duterte has remained near the   mark with his highest rating at 84 percent after his election but before his inauguration. Reuters adds that Duterte?s initial trust rating in December 2015 was at 47 percent.  Duterte?s ratings are better with men than women as 83 percent of men and 79 percent of women say they had ?much trust? in the president gaining one percentage point among men and one among women. Regionally his best ratings came from his native Mindanao a southern Philippine island where 90 percent of respondents said they had ?much trust? in Duterte down from 92 percent in December. The Philippine Star notes that the presidential palace announced the numbers with pride as SWS deems an 80 percent ?much trust? percentage as an ?excellent? approval rating. ?The President continues to be the most trusted national leader today? presidential spokesman Ernesto Arbella told reporters. ?His net trust rating has been excellent for four consecutive quarters considering the deeply entrenched culture of illegal drugs criminality and corruption. ? Duterte?s enduring popularity appears unaffected by a global campaign to raise awareness about his call for extrajudicial killings against drug suspects. Duterte who won the presidency on a campaign to eradicate drug crime calling upon his   tenure as the mayor of Davao City where he enacted sprawling   initiatives. Duterte has encouraged civilians to kill suspected drug criminals and offered them bounties. He also claimed to have killed suspects himself as mayor. In December SWS found that his policies against drugs were largely popular. While 80 percent of respondents said they personally feared being killed as part of Duterte?s drug war 85 percent said they approved of Duterte?s approach to solving the problem.   a regional broadcast outlet quotes experts stating that Duterte?s popularity is largely the product of his populist   image. ?He comes across very strongly as ?makamasa? and it?s not only giving an impression he packs that with good action? Fr. Ranhilio Aquino dean of the San Beda Graduate School of Law told the outlet. ?Makamasa? is a Tagalog term roughly meaning ?man of the people. ? Duterte refuses to live in the presidential palace Malacanang in Manila for fear of it being haunted by late presidents. Instead he lives in his humble Mindanao home while he is not in the capital. In January Duterte hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his home instead of Malacanang offering him a traditional breakfast and his favorite mosquito net. The positive ratings for Duterte arrive as he embarks on a foreign policy venture around Asia. The presidential palace announced that Duterte will leave the country on May 10 to visit Cambodia Hong Kong and China. Among the items on Duterte?s agenda is a meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) where an estimated 700 ?leaders from business government and civil society groups? will convene. Duterte?s visit to China also arrives following what appears to be a shift in policy from the Philippine president who once boasted of seeking to sever ties with the United States to get closer to Beijing but has since offered President Donald Trump ?full friendship and cooperation. ?

Donald Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,12/30/2016,2016,12,,In comments on CNN Trump spokesperson Kellyanne Conway said that the Obama administration?s new moves against Russia are likely designed to ?box in?   Donald Trump before he even takes office. [Conway appeared on CNN?s Anderson Cooper 360 on December 30 and noted that accusations that Russia hacked the 2016 election are rising to a ?fever pitch? since Donald J. Trump won the White House. She also pointed out that Obama seems to have motives other than serious foreign policy behind his moves.  Kellyanne Conway wonders if Russian sanctions were intended to restrict Trump https:  .  https:  .   ?   Anderson Cooper 360 (@AC360) December 30 2016  ?Even those who are sympathetic to President Obama on most issues are saying that part of the reason he did this today was to quote ?box in?   Trump? Conway said. Conway did not outright accuse the President of acting in bad faith. ?I was quoting David Sanger?s piece in The New York Times? Conway insisted. ?I am merely saying that if The New York Times? report is true and credible that that would be very unfortunate if politics were the motivating factor here but we can?t help but think that that?s often true. ? The incoming President?s adviser also pointed out that Trump is ?not in favor of foreign governments interfering in our elections or interfering in our intelligence but we?re also not in favor of our intelligence interfering with elections after the fact. ? Earlier that Friday President Obama took the unusual action of ejecting dozens of Russian diplomats from the country as he ramped up his response to his charge that Russian hackers interfered in the November elections. Despite Obama?s constant claim however no actual proof has been forthcoming that Russia hacked our elections. In response to Obama?s ouster of 35 Russian officials Russian strongman Vladimir Putin dismissed Obama?s actions and did not retaliate in kind as he has in the past. ?Reserving the right to retaliate we will not resort to the level of irresponsible ?kitchen? diplomacy? Putin said in a Friday statement calling it ?regrettable? that Obama was choosing to end his administration with such a provocative action.

192,26631,Cubans Stranded at Border Hope for Trump Welcome,Breitbart,Tony Aranda,1/17/2017,2017,1,,NUEVO LAREDO Tamaulipas  ?   The dream of arriving to the U. S. under the Wet   Foot policy has turned into a nightmare after hundreds of Cubans have been left stranded at the   border. The islanders have a   permit from the Mexican government to travel north that leaves them subject to deportation thereafter. [More than 50 Cubans currently stuck in this border city are left only to hope that   Donald Trump shortly reverses the recent decision imposed by President Barack Obama that ended the   naturalization process for Cuban refugees. Some of the Cubans who spoke with Breitbart Texas expressed their surprise and disappointment upon learning that U. S. authorities would not let them enter the country legally.   ?A new president that wants to help the oppressed people of Cuba is our only hope? said Carlos Martin a stranded Cuban refugee. ?We have nothing and we can not go back it was a very radical decision. ?  Similar to the situation in Nuevo Laredo in the border state of Nuevo Len local authorities are preparing for hundreds of Cuban families to arrive with underage children as they attempt to reach Tamaulipas and eventually pass to Texas before their permits expire. The   permits are given to the Cubans by Mexico?s National Immigration Institute granting them a temporary stay in the country after which they must leave the country. The permit has generally been used by migrants from a variety of nations to make their way to a northern border checkpoint.  ?Many here think that the new Trump government will open the doors to the Cubans who arrive at the international bridges? a Mexican immigration agent from Nuevo Len told Breitbart Texas ?For them this is their only option they don?t have money and they can?t return to Cuba. ?  As Breitbart Texas reported the new immigration policy by Obama paints a target on the Cubans who will likely be sought by criminal organizations or law enforcement once their permit expires.

195,26634,GOP Rep Jordan: Replacement Plan ?Obamacare In a Different Form? - ?We Didn?t Tell the Voters? We Would Do That - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,3/8/2017,2017,3,,On Wednesday?s broadcast of MSNBC?s ?Morning Joe? House Freedom Caucus member Representative Jim Jordan ( ) touted legislation he will be introducing later in the day to just do a clean repeal of Obamacare and criticized the replacement plan as ?Obamacare in a different form. Because we didn?t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn?t tell the voters we?re going to repeal Obamacare but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn?t tell the voters we?re going to repeal Obamacare but start a new entitlement. ?  Jordan said ?[L]et?s do this right and more importantly let?s do what we told the voters we?re going to do. That?s why today I?ll be introducing legislation which just says clean repeal. Let?s vote on the exact same thing 15 months ago every single Republican in the House every single Republican in the Senate voted on. We put it on President Obama?s desk. Of course he vetoed it. But let?s put that same legislation on President Trump?s desk and then work on the replacement model that will actually bring down the cost of insurance. I don?t think the plan they introduced yesterday is going to bring down the cost for working class and middle class families. ? He stated of the current replacement ?Every conservative group out there is opposed to this legislation because as I said yesterday and others have said I think it?s Obamacare in a different form. Because we didn?t tell the voters we were going to repeal Obamacare but keep some of the Obamacare taxes. We didn?t tell the voters we?re going to repeal Obamacare but keep and extend Medicaid expansion. And we certainly didn?t tell the voters we?re going to repeal Obamacare but start a new entitlement. ? He further said that he doesn?t think the current replacement ?could pass today.   ?     So this needs to be changed in a dramatic way for it to have a chance to pass in my judgment. ? Jordan continued his criticism of the current replacement arguing ?[T]his is what Americans hate. We campaign on one thing and then we get here and say oh we can?t do what we campaigned on. We really can?t do a clean repeal and then replace it with something that?s going to bring down the costs. We?ve got to mush it all together and do some different form of Obamacare. That?s what the American voters hate. Let?s do what we told them we were going to do. Let?s do what they sent us here to do and what they expect us to do. ? Jordan also stated ?Even if you don?t have the CBO score look at the four corners of the document and read what it says. I think it?s not going to bring down the cost of premiums for working class and middle class families. That?s why I oppose it. I think it?s Obamacare as I?ve said Obamacare in a different form. That?s why I oppose it. But it would also be nice to have a score. I can?t believe the score won?t be high because when you?re extending and expanding the Medicaid expansion when you?re starting this new entitlement called advanceable refundable tax credits when you?re doing all that I?ve got to believe that?s a cost to the federal government. But apart from that just look at what it does it keeps the federal government in control of how this thing works the exchange and that sort of thing. That?s the wrong approach because we?ve seen how bad Obamacare has been for the American people the last six years. ? Jordan added his replacement plan ?would put in place policies that will bring back affordable insurance. That?s the big problem right now. If people can afford the premiums they can?t afford the deductibles. Fewer choices higher costs is what Obamacare has given us. We want those policies like expanded health savings accounts interstate shopping easier formation of association health plans tax deductibility on the individual market side so that you begin to equalize treatment for folks who get their insurance in the individual market with those who get   plan insurance. So that?s what we want to do. Those kinds of things will bring down the cost. And most importantly you get out all the regulations which drove up the cost of insurance. Never forget what Obamacare did. It set mandates taxes and regulations drove up the cost of insurance told every American you have to buy it and if you don?t there?s a penalty. That?s what we have to get away from. ? Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett
196,26635,GRAPHIC: Three Killed in Drug Shootout Outside Ritzy Mexican Border State Bar,Breitbart,Cartel Chronicles,5/6/2017,2017,5,,MONTERREY Nuevo Leon  ?   Cartel gunmen killed three men and injured a fourth in an apparent hit outside a bar in one of the most exclusive suburbs in this city. [Early Thursday morning a security detail transported a Mexican businessman his wife and a group of other men to a local bar when unknown gunmen suddenly attacked. The gunmen began to rain gunfire on their victims information released to Breitbart Texas by the Nuevo Leon government revealed.   The shooting took place in the Centrito Valle entertainment district of the upscale San Pedro neighborhood. The brief shooting killed three of the men and injured one of the bodyguards right outside a bar called La Unica.  Nuevo Leon public safety officials identified the three murder victims as    Jose Herrera Aispuro from the Mexican state of Sinaloa    Michael Raciel Almela Martinez from Mexico State and Carlos Sanchez Pliego Mier from the State of Queretaro. In the case of Sanchez Pliego authorities could not determine his exact age since the man appears to have various sets of identification documents indicating various ages.  At the crime scene investigators noted that Herrera Aispuro wore a Rolex and had a large amount of Mexican currency in his possession. Mexican investigators revealed to Breitbart Texas that Herrera Aispuro is believed to have been an attorney working for operatives of the Beltran Leyva Cartel.  As Breitbart Texas has reported Centrito Valle has been an area under the control of Beltran Leyva operatives who hold a monopoly over the street level drug distribution in the upscale sector. Breitbart Texas confirmed that last week an accountant for the Beltran Leyva was also gunned down in Monterrey pointing to an apparent escalation of violence between rival cartels over the drug territories in Nuevo Leon. Editor?s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas Coahuila and Nuevo Len to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas?

199,50358,Istanbul attack: Dozens killed at nightclub,CNN,Euan McKirdy,12/31/2016,2016,12,,Istanbul (CNN) At least 39 people were killed and at least 69 wounded in an attack in a nightclub early Sunday as they were celebrating the new year Turkey?s Interior Minister said. ?We are face to face with a terror attack? Interior minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters.   of the dead have been identified he said. Of those 16 were foreign nationals and five were Turkish. US officials also called it a terrorist attack making it the first of 2017.  Latest developments The death toll from the Reina nightclub shooting has risen to 39The number of injured is at 69 ?Four of them are in critical condition    one very critical? says Interior MinisterAt least one gunman still on the run    it is unclear how many attackers were presentNo claim of responsibility has yet been madeUS Turkish officials say incident is a terrorist attack Soylu also said that ?the efforts to locate the terrorist are ongoing. Security forces have begun the necessary operations. God willing soon (the attacker) will be apprehended.? Around 1:15 a. m. Sunday the gunman shot a police officer who was guarding the front gate at the Reina nightclub killing him Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said.  ?He entered the club and attacked innocent people who were there to celebrate the new year. It was a cruel   act? the governor said.  There have been no claims of responsibility. The fate of the attacker    or attackers    was also unclear. ?Crazy people shooting everything? Witnesses in the club said they heard a loud noise then a security officer told everyone to get out. One victim said he didn?t know how many attackers there were but he saw one person and hid.  ?I got shot in the (expletive) leg man? he told journalists in English as he was taken into an ambulance. ?These crazy people came in shooting everything.? A security camera captured the moment a gunman dressed in dark clothing dashed into the Reina nightclub as bullets ricocheted in the street.  The assailant who has not yet been identified opened fire inside the   nightclub in the busy Besiktas neighborhood according to Turkish   news agency Anadolu.  Besiktas on the European shore of the Bosporus is known for its expensive   class neighborhoods. The popular area had been under heavy police security for new year celebrations.  Ortakoy where Reina is located is a vibrant seaside neighborhood that caters to a wide range of people from the   who party at clubs like Reina to students who buy stuffed baked potatoes from vendors along the Bosporus.  Reina itself is one of the first clubs to open along the famous strait and remains a touchstone for Istanbul?s exclusive nightlife. It boasts a classic Istanbul view.  Several analysts said the attack looked more like a   attack.  ?In terms of the   aspects of this attack it?s a youthful place a bar that?s pretty   in particular to expats. It?s sort of the lively area of Istanbul and especially on New Year?s Eve night    all of those have hallmarks of   if not directed attacks to maximize casualties and get a lot of news around it? said Juliette Kayyem CNN?s national security analyst.  Turkey?s recent tumult Turkey has endured a recent wave of terrorist attacks leaving many people wary.  ?This attack is of course a horrible development but not shocking to many Turks who chose to stay inside this New Year?s Eve? said Aykan Erdemir former member of the Turkish Parliament. ?Turkey is known to host these big parties to celebrate New Year?s but this year most citizens were wary of Islamist attacks so they chose to celebrate it at home with their friends.?  He said the attack seemed similar to what happened at the Bataclan a Paris concert hall that was attacked by gunmen in 2015.  ?This is an attack on the Western lifestyle. This is an attack on Turkey?s secular urban way of living. And this will simply fuel the ongoing cultural clashes the ongoing polarization in Turkey? Erdemir said.  The United States condemned the attack.  ?That such an atrocity could be perpetrated upon innocent revelers many of whom were celebrating New Year?s Eve underscores the savagery of the attackers? National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.  The US State Department said the attacks like this one on its NATO ally ?only reinforce our strong determination to work with the government of Turkey to counter the scourge of terrorism.?  The US Embassy in Turkey warned citizens to avoid the area where the attack occurred.  A violent year Turkey faces numerous battles across different fronts. Not only has the Syrian conflict and refugee crisis spilled over into Turkey but Turkey is also battling ISIS and Kurdish militants. Both have staged attacks in Turkey which is still reeling from a bloody and failed military coup in July. ISIS is suspected in a June attack at Istanbul?s Ataturk Airport that left 44 people dead and an explosion at an August wedding not far from the border with Syria that killed at least 54 people. Meanwhile Turkish security forces clash on an almost daily basis with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants mostly in predominantly Kurdish parts of southeastern Turkey. A pair of bombings in Istanbul killed 44 people and wounded 155 others December 10 in an attack by a breakaway group of the PKK. The two explosions occurred after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena. On December 17 a car bomb exploded near a public bus killing 13 soldiers in the central province of Kayseri. Three days later a gunman assassinated Russia?s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery. 
200,50359,Alabama Clemson back in national title game,CNN,Jill Martin,12/31/2016,2016,12,,Atlanta (CNN) This season?s College Football Playoff centers on one simple question: Can anyone stop Alabama? Because if it?s not clear by now it should be: The national championship is the Crimson Tide?s to lose. No. 1 Alabama is back in the national championship game for the second year in a row winning the Peach Bowl semifinal   against No. 4 Washington at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. The Crimson Tide?s next opponent is a familiar one. No. 2 Clemson who lost to Alabama   in the title game last season pummeled No. 3 Ohio State   in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale Arizona to set up a national championship rematch. Alabama ( ) has won four of the past seven titles and is favored again. On Saturday Alabama?s defense reinforced that it?s the nation?s best stuffing the Huskies?   offense and scoring a defensive touchdown off an interception. ?I think our defense did a really good job against their explosive big play receivers and offense that they have and I?m just really pleased with the way we played together as a team? Alabama head coach Nick Saban said. Washington in the College Football Playoff for the first time ends its season at  . Clemson ( ) meanwhile asserted its will against Ohio State ( ). Quarterback Deshaun Watson a   Heisman Trophy finalist who finished second in the voting this season accounted for three of the Tigers? touchdowns. Clemson hasn?t won a national championship since the 1981 season. ?What a night? Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said. ?What a journey. I just can?t tell you how proud I am of our team our staff. Just incredible resolve relentless pursuit to get back here and to try to find a way to win. Just awesome man.? Alabama defense the greatest ever? Alabama?s dominance this season starts with defense and the Crimson Tide boast the nation?s best coming into the Peach Bowl leading the country in total defense rushing defense scoring defense and defensive touchdowns. In fact the Tide?s defense has scored almost as many touchdowns this season (11) as it has allowed (15). One of those defensive scores came Saturday when Alabama senior linebacker Ryan Anderson picked off Washington sophomore quarterback Jake Browning and took it back 26 yards for the touchdown. That made it a   Crimson Tide lead with 1:13 left in the second quarter. Anderson was named Peach Bowl defensive MVP. Additionally a forced fumble late in the first quarter by Alabama junior defensive back Anthony Averett led to a   field goal for senior kicker Adam Griffith. The    Huskies entered the Peach Bowl fourth in the nation in scoring offense with 44. 5 points per game. But aside from a   touchdown pass from Browning to junior wide receiver Dante Pettis with 8:01 left in the first quarter which gave the Huskies at   lead Washington couldn?t muster much. Following that score Washington didn?t take a snap in Alabama territory until there was 1:46 left in the game. The Huskies finished with a   194 total yards. ?It was disappointing we didn?t move the ball better? Washington head coach Chris Petersen said. ?We?ve studied every snap that they?ve had this year and the tape doesn?t lie when you watch that much tape. I mean that?s as good a defense as there is out there in college football and they played like it.? It was a   lead. Alabama answered Washington?s score on the following drive with an   touchdown rush from sophomore running back Bo Scarbrough with 5:01 left in the opening period. Scarbrough also scored on a   run with 11:56 left in the fourth quarter putting the game firmly out of reach. It was a career day for Scarbrough. He finished with 180 yards    an Alabama bowl record    and two touchdowns. He was named offensive MVP. ?You guys know me? Saban said. ?Whoever is hot that?s who?s going to get the ball. And he?s been hot lately and he?s going to get the ball.? Alabama which has been ranked No. 1 since the beginning of the season is making the case for being the greatest team of all time and now it needs to win just one more game to cap off a perfect season. Since September 2015 Alabama has won 26 consecutive games. It also has won the past three Southeastern Conference championships. Watson stars in Clemson blowout In big games Watson has a history of showing up. Saturday was no exception. Clemson?s star junior quarterback was    passing for 259 yards and one touchdown. He also rushed for 57 yards and two scores. With his performance Watson was named the Fiesta Bowl offensive MVP. It?s the second consecutive year he has earned that honor in a College Football Playoff semifinal also doing so in the Tigers? Orange Bowl win against Oklahoma in 2015. ?I just try to play my best and win games? Watson said. The Buckeyes on the other hand were dreadful. Junior quarterback J. T. Barrett threw for just 127 yards and was intercepted twice. Senior kicker Tyler Durbin missed two field goals. It was the first time Ohio State had been shut out since 1993 and it was the first time in Urban Meyer?s head coaching career that he has been shut out. ?Ohio State is not used to this? Meyer said. ?I?m not used to this and we will not get used to this. That?s not going to happen again. So we?ll get things worked out.?

202,50361,Trump says he has inside information on hacking,CNN,Kevin Liptak,1/1/2017,2017,1,,West Palm Beach Florida (CNN)  Donald Trump said Saturday he has information that others lack and promised to reveal his knowledge this week reiterating again his doubts that Russia was behind   in the US election. Speaking to reporters ahead of an   New Year?s Eve bash at his    estate a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the tampering.  ?It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don?t know and so they cannot be sure of the situation? he said. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew Trump said ?You?ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.?  Trump has scheduled an intelligence briefing midweek on the hacking a response to President Barack Obama?s announcement of new sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for the  . ?I just want them to be sure because it?s a pretty serious charge and I want them to be sure. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction that was a disaster and they were wrong? Trump said referencing failed intelligence in the   to the Iraq War as a reason for skepticism. ?I think it?s unfair if they don?t know? he said. ?And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove.? Trump has repeatedly cast aside a US intelligence assessment announced in early October that Moscow was behind the hacking despite already receiving classified intelligence briefings on the matter. He?s also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin calling him smart this week for withholding reciprocal sanctions on the US. Trump?s stance has put him at odds with most congressional Republicans who have argued for a tougher stance on Russia. Sen. John McCain the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee will convene a hearing on   Thursday. Officials expelled On Sunday morning a Rossiya Airlines Special Flight Squadron plane believed to be carrying some expelled Russian government officials departed Dulles Airport just outside Washington. The US had ordered 35 officials and their families from the embassy in Washington and the consulate in San Francisco to leave the country by noon Sunday in response to charges that Russians hacked the presidential election and harassed US diplomatic personnel in Russia.  A State Department official told CNN early Sunday evening all of the expelled Russian diplomats have left the US. ?We can confirm that the 35 Russian diplomats declared persona non grata have along with their family members departed the United States. ? the official said. Congressional Democrats on Sunday scoffed at Trump?s assertion that Russian involvement wasn?t clear.  ?It?s very solid? said Rep. Adam Schiff of California the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee on ABC?s ?This Week.?  Schiff called Trump?s approach ?dangerous? adding ?If he?s going to have any credibility as president he needs to stop talking this way. He needs to stop denigrating the intelligence.? community.  He?s going to rely on them.  At    Saturday Trump expressed deep misgivings about technology during his brief exchange with reporters positioned outside his Grand Ballroom.   ?If you have something really important write it out and have it delivered by courier the   way because I?ll tell you what no computer is safe? he said. ?I don?t care what they say no computer is safe.?

206,50365,Timeline: Turkey?s bloody year,CNN,Greg Botelho,12/11/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) In one of the most   countries in the world not even New Year?s Day was safe from an attack. Just an hour after the new year began a gunman shot his way into a popular   nightclub in Istanbul killing at least 35 people. Scores more were wounded.  The attack was the latest in a wave of deadly violence that has killed people in different parts of Turkey throughout the past 365 days. 2016 was a violent year for Turkey. There were suicide blasts claimed by ISIS and running battles between government forces and outlawed Kurdish PKK militants. A failed coup sparked a   crackdown on alleged coup plotters. And the Russian ambassador was gunned down by a man shouting about the Syrian city of Aleppo.  Below are some of the major attacks that occurred this year: December 20: Assassination of top Russian diplomat A gunman shouting ?Do not forget Aleppo!? assassinated Russia?s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery in what leaders of Russia and Turkey called a provocative terror attack. The gunman identified as police officer Mevlut Mert Altintas was killed in the attack on Ambassador Andrey Karlov according to various news organizations including Reuters. December 17: Attack on soldiers in Kayseri A car bomb exploded near a public bus killing 13 soldiers and wounding 55 people Turkey?s   Anadolu agency reported.

November 4: The Diyarbakir bombing A car bomb targeting a police station in southeastern Turkey killed seven civilians and two police officers. It also injured over 100 people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in Diyarbakir according to a statement circulated online by the   Amaq agency. October 9: ?Suicide rush? near Iraqi border A bomb exploded outside a police station in the Semdinli district of Hakkari Province    about  48 miles from the Iraqi border    killing at least 18 people.  Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said eight civilians died and 10 soldiers were killed in the attack in which a pickup truck laden with about five tons of explosives made a ?suicide rush? at a checkpoint outside the station. The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack. The US condemned the bombing ?in the strongest terms?. September 12: Car bomb near government offices Suspected Kurdish militants detonated a car bomb near local government offices in the southeastern city of Van wounding at least 50 people.  The blast hit some 200 meters from the Van provincial governor?s office. It occurred a day after two dozen mayors from   municipalities were stripped of their office. August 21: The bloody wedding A suspected suicide bomber detonated explosives at a wedding party in the southeastern city of Gaziantep killing at least 53 people and injuring about 100.

207,50366,US utility: Alleged Russian malware on laptop,CNN,Evan Perez,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) The indicators from the malicious software found on a Burlington Electric Company laptop match those on malware found in the Democratic National Committee computers that the US government has blamed on Russians the Department of Homeland Security said Saturday. DHS spokesman Todd Breasseale said the department?s investigation into the cyber intrusion on the computer is ongoing and he couldn?t comment further. The DHS?s acknowledgment is the first such confirmation by the government that the malware is the same as the code used in malicious cyber activity that the US government has blamed on Russian hackers attempting to influence November?s election.  It comes a day after Burlington Electric announced it found the malicious software on a computer that was not connected to its grid control systems. Both the Department of Homeland Security and the utility said Saturday there are no indications that the electric grid was breached.  Burlington Electric General Manager Neale Lunderville told CNN?s Suzanne Malveaux that the utility found an Internet address that was associated with recent malicious cyber activity and that IP address was communicating with a company computer.  ?We immediately isolated the machine pulled it off the network alerted federal authorities and began to work with them? he said.  Burlington Electric which serves 19 600 customers in Vermont said it found the code after utility companies nationwide were sent an alert by Homeland Security.  The federal government refers to the Russian malicious cyber activity as Grizzly Steppe. Officials involved in the investigation of the malware say they do not believe it was an attempt to bring down part of the electric grid.  One reason why they cited is that Burlington Electric is a small utility and therefore the impact would not be as great as if it were a larger company with many more customers.  The Washington Post first reported the existence of the malicious software. Burlington Electric issued a statement Saturday saying that any reports that the company was hacked or breached are false. It added there are no indications that customer information was accessed.  Gov. Shumlin calls Putin a ?thug?  Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin didn?t hold back in a scathing message issued Friday that linked Russian President Vladimir Putin to the cyber threat. ?Vermonters and all Americans should be both alarmed and outraged that one of the world?s leading thugs Vladimir Putin has been attempting to hack our electric grid which we rely upon to support our    economy health and safety? said Shumlin in a written statement.  Shumlin a Democrat called on the federal government to investigate and take action to prevent future attacks.   ?This episode should highlight the urgent need for our federal government to vigorously pursue and put an end to this sort of Russian meddling? said Shumlin.   US Sen. Patrick Leahy   said he and his staff were briefed Friday by Vermont state police about the development which he called a ?direct threat to Vermont.? ?  Russian hacking is a serious threat and the attempts to penetrate the electric grid through a Vermont utility are the latest example? Leahy said.  ?This is beyond hackers having electronic joyrides    this is now about trying to access utilities to potentially manipulate the grid and shut it down in the middle of winter.? A US government official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday it?s not yet known ?the full scope or intent or if this was an isolated event or not.? After weeks of   accusations about Russian hacking around the US election the White House announced plans Thursday to expel 35 Russian diplomats    giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the country    and shuttering a pair of Russian compounds in New York and Maryland used by officials in theory for recreational purposes. The Russian government has denied the hacking allegations. The DHS and the FBI made a   report public Thursday with information about the malware code    which was found on Democratic National Committee computers    and urged entities to check for it. Targets? ?Government think tanks universities? The report said activity by Russian civilian and military intelligence services is ?part of an ongoing campaign of   operations directed at the US government and its citizens.? Russian operations went after ?government organizations critical infrastructure entities think tanks universities political organizations and corporations? according to the report.  The hackers sent fake emails texts and other messages attempting to get US users to click on malicious links US officials have said. Some links led users to download the malware while others prompted people to change their passwords which the hackers could then use.  A US official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN that the Obama administration sought to alert utilities and other entities in the United States and abroad to the malicious activity so they could better secure their networks. In December 2015 Ukraine was struck by a massive cyberattack that cut power to 103 cities and towns and affected 186 more. The attack involved a team of sophisticated hackers who targeted six power companies at the same time US officials briefed on an investigation into the attack told CNN in February.  Destructive malware wrecked computers and wiped out sensitive control systems for parts of the Ukraine power grid making it more difficult for technicians to restore power. The attack raised major concerns because the US power grid and other major industrial facilities have many of the same vulnerabilities that were exploited in the Ukraine attack US officials told CNN. In February Elizabeth   the Obama administration?s deputy energy secretary accused Russia of being behind the cyberattack.  Other top US intelligence and security officials said then that the evidence wasn?t conclusive enough to tie the Russian government to the attack.
208,50368,Roberts praises lower court judges in annual SCOTUS report,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts devoted his annual report on the state of the judiciary Saturday to the role of lower court judges who he called ?selfless patriotic and brave individuals.? ?This is no job for impulsive timid or inattentive souls? Roberts wrote in the report which sheds light each year on an issue the chief justice believes should receive the public?s attention. Roberts? message comes as   Donald Trump prepares to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and reshape the lower courts. There are currently more than a hundred vacancies at the district and appellate court level nationwide according to the administrative office of the US courts. In past years the chief?s reports have emphasized issues such as judicial pay budget cuts and recusal rules. Roberts a keen student of the history of the Supreme Court almost always manages to weave in historical references. This year?s report details George Washington?s role in appointing 13 original United States district judges a list that included a general in the Revolutionary War a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a poet and musician. ?These individuals are not well known in our era but they launched the new system of United States District Courts and set the course for the important role those institutions would come to play in the new republic? Roberts wrote. Turning to present day judges Roberts said that they are not often the focus of public attention but that they play a ?crucial role.? ?You might be asking? Roberts wrote ?why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours exacting skill and intense devotion    while promising high stress solitary confinement and guaranteed criticism.?  Roberts continued: ?The answer lies in the rewards of public service.? Congress has authorized 673 district court judgeships. Although Roberts said that ?unlike politicians they work largely outside of the public eye? he did not mention the fact that sometimes district court judges find themselves in the middle of a political storm as when district court Judge Andrew S. Hanen of the Southern District of Texas temporarily stopped the Obama administration?s executive actions on immigration in 2015.  The programs at issue never did go into effect after a deadlocked Supreme Court blocked them earlier this year. On the current court only Justice Sonia Sotomayor has served as a district court judge. Trump?s list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees is dominated by appellate court judges and state Supreme Court justices but it also includes Judge Amul Thapar of the Eastern District of Kentucky the home state of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
209,50369,Former student charged in teacher?s death,CNN,Shachar Peled,12/28/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) A    man who as a high school student fathered a child with his teacher has been indicted on undisclosed charges related to the killing of the teacher and their son according to a Manhattan district attorney spokesman. The bodies of Felicia Barahona 36 and her    son Miguel were found Monday in Barahona?s upper Manhattan apartment.  Barahona unconscious and unresponsive on her living room floor had a telephone cord wrapped around her neck. The child was discovered underwater in a bathtub. Both were pronounced dead at the scene police said. Isaac Duran Infante whose relationship with Barahona five years ago while he was a student and she was a teacher led to her being fired was arrested Tuesday.  ?He admitted to us he went there because of that to end the life of Felicia Barahona? Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters Wednesday referring to the suspect. ?While he was there he decided to kill his son as well.? Infante told police he felt antagonized by Barahona who he said dressed the child in girls? clothing Boyce said. Another possible motive involved ?monetary issues? according to Boyce.  He had been arraigned Wednesday without entering a plea and was ordered held without bail said his lawyer Allen Farbman.  Barahona died from strangulation and Miguel of asphyxia according to Julie Bolcer of the New York chief medical examiner?s office. A 911 call from the building superintendent brought police to the apartment Monday. The tragedy came more than four years after Barahona?s dismissal after her relationship with Infante was discovered. DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx terminated her teaching position in 2012 saying she had invited a high school student to her home multiple times since late 2011. The sexual relationship with the student resulted in her pregnancy a Special Commissioner of Investigation for the New York City School District (SCI) report shows.   The SCI report released in 2012 never identified the student by name. Police investigators this week confirmed that Infante was the student and the father of Barahona?s child.  The 2012 report stated that teacher and student had sexual encounters about five times a week and the student eventually moved in with her in January 2012. The report was specific in its details: ?When he tried to use a condom Barahona told him that she did not like condoms and not to worry? it said. The SCI report also said Barahona planned to marry him and had bought wedding rings before they ended the relationship.  The report mentions Barahona had a younger daughter when she met Infante. According to the report he did ?not get along? with her daughter one of the reasons for their breakup. Other reasons included Infante drinking alcohol in Barahona?s apartment and his intentions to take the baby he had fathered to visit his family according to the report.
210,50370,Liverpool beats Manchester City Chelsea equals EPL record,CNN,,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Chelsea registered a   13th successive victory Saturday as Liverpool fought to a   win over rivals Manchester City to stay in touch with the English Premier League leaders. It?s Antonio Conte?s Chelsea that heads into the New Year top of the table after a     victory over a spirited Stoke City. Later in the day Liverpool got the better of City thanks to Georginio Wijnaldum?s   goal. READ: Football team equals record winning run All of which mean Chelsea leads   Liverpool by six points as it bids to win its fifth English championship with City four points behind Jurgen Klopp?s side. Having twice taken the lead only to be pegged back by Stoke Chelsea?s superiority eventually shone through as it powered to three points thanks in part to a brace from Willian and a late goal from striker Diego Costa. But Klopp?s Liverpool responded with a crucial victory of its own. Dutch midfielder Wijnaldum?s powerful early header from Adam Lallana?s cross was enough to leave Pep Guardiola?s City 10 points adrift of Chelsea. ?We were not cool enough in possession? Klopp told BT Sport ?but they (City) couldn?t create real chances because we defended so well.  ?It?s not about having a philosophy but adapting to the opponent. We don?t want to show how good we are we want the three points.? Meanwhile Conte congratulated his players after their latest win. ?To win 13 games in a row in this league is very difficult? Chelsea?s manager told BBC Sport. ?Now it?s important to celebrate the arrival of the new year then to think of the next game against Tottenham? added Conte referring to Chelsea?s next game on Wednesday when his team will seek a 14th consecutive Premier League win. Arsenal had set the record for 13 Premier League wins in a row during the   season. Arsene Wenger?s team won 14 consecutive league matches between February and August 2002. ?Numbers are not important if you do not win the title? said Conte. ?Now they are fantastic and we are proud but we must concentrate on the second part of the season.? Manchester United?s slim title hopes were maintained thanks to a   defeat of Middlesbrough at Old Trafford though Jose Mourinho?s side are 13 points behind Chelsea. After falling behind to Grant Leadbitter?s   goal Mourinho?s team recovered thanks to late goals from Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba. United?s Portuguese manager credited his team?s recovery to the fans who he claimed played a crucial role in a comeback win that leaves United sixth.  ?In the last 20 minutes the fans were on the pitch    they were not in the stands? Mourinho told reporters. ?And this is a credit to the players who showed amazing character to go and go and go and go.?
211,50371,Greek ambassador to Brazil killed,CNN,Marilia Brocchetto,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Police contend Greece?s ambassador to Brazil was killed by his wife?s lover    a military police officer    and the widow is being questioned in the crime Brazil?s   Agencia Brasil news agency reported Saturday.

213,50374,Rebel warning over Syrian ceasefire violations,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Rebels in the Free Syrian Army have warned they will no longer adhere to Syria?s fledgling ceasefire if the regime continues to violate it according to a statement seen by CNN.  For now the ceasefire remains in effect despite skirmishes and violations reported by both sides according to the FSA statement and Syrian   SANA news agency.  Airstrikes hit three villages Saturday in the Damascus suburb of Wadi Barada an activist there told CNN. Two women were injured by Hezbollah sniper fire in another village Abu Mohammad   the activist said. A day earlier   said more than 20 airstrikes were reported in the area which is home to a major water spring that supplies Damascus. CNN could not independently verify the reports. Syria?s state news agency SANA has not reported on military activity Saturday in Wadi Barada.  The   Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Friday that regime forces faced strong resistance from Islamist militants near Wadi Barada. Rockets mortar shells On Friday two opposition groups the Syrian National Coalition and Syria?s High Negotiations Committee claimed the truce was violated more than 30 times in the first 24 hours of its coming into force. SANA in turn cited the Russian Coordination Center based at the Russian Hmeymim air base in Latakia Syria as saying Friday that ?terrorist groups? had violated the ceasefire a dozen times. ?Over the past 24 hours terrorist groups breached the cessation of hostilities agreement in Syria 12 times in Damascus Aleppo and Hama? the SANA report said with half of the instances occurring in Damascus. The report didn?t specify which rebel groups were allegedly involved but added that ?terrorists from Jabhat   targeted a number of towns and neighborhoods in Aleppo and its countryside with rocket and mortar shells.? Jabhat   is another name for Jabhat Fateh   the former al Qaeda affiliate in Syria which was excluded from the ceasefire agreement as an extremist group according to Turkey and Russia. The FSA encompasses a number of predominantly moderate rebel groups across Syria. The fragile nationwide ceasefire brokered by Turkey and Russia began early Friday. It is the basis for planned peace talks between the opposition and the regime to be held in Astana Kazakhstan in the New Year.  UN Security Council vote The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a draft resolution on Saturday proposed by delegations from Turkey and Russia that backs the ceasefire arrangement in Syria. The resolution supports a peace process with Turkey and Russia serving as guarantors.  Russia?s Ambassador to the UN Vitaly Churkin said Saturday the resolution ?speaks to the need for compliance with a cessation of hostilities . .. in Syria and of a very important meeting in the capital of Astana. .. where delegations of the opposition and the government will for the first time meet face to face.?  The meeting backed by the UN in Geneva and outlined in the newly approved resolution is scheduled for February 8 2017.  US Ambassador to the UN Michelle Sison lauded the agreement but asked for more transparency saying ?We are still learning more about this initiative including details regarding its implementation.? ?In this regard we regret that the annexes to the agreements which outline the ceasefire arrangement brokered by Russia and Turkey in detail have not yet been made available? said Sison. The latest effort comes after previous ceasefire attempts by the international community crumbled.  A successful nationwide ceasefire hinges on many fighting factions laying down arms. Groups from Iraq Iran and Lebanon also are fighting alongside the forces of Syrian President Bashar  .  Turkey and Russia previously said the ceasefire deal excludes groups considered ?terrorist organizations? by the UN Security Council ruling out ISIS and Jabhat Fateh  . But alliances between different rebel groups make matters complicated. The Russian Defense Ministry said influential Islamist groups such as Ahrar   and Jaysh   had signed up to the process. But the Syrian army asserted that groups linked to Fateh   of which Ahrar   has been the most prominent would be excluded from the deal. Weakened rebel position The latest truce also follows several ceasefire agreements brokered by Turkey and Russia in the city of Aleppo this month. Most were broken but one held long enough to allow the evacuations of tens of thousands of rebels and civilians from eastern Aleppo. Eastern Aleppo had been under rebel control for four years and had been choked off by the Syrian regime leading to shortages of food and supplies for civilians.  The Syrian regime then gained full control of Aleppo a major turning point that has limited the opposition?s military and political options.  The brutal civil war has raged on for nearly six years and killed an estimated 400 000 people.
214,50375,Trump ditches press pool to play golf,CNN,Eugene Scott,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN)  Donald Trump ditched his press pool Saturday to play golf the latest example of his break with precedent regarding the media covering him and his transition. ?He made a   trip to Jupiter. We weren?t aware and appreciate everyone?s understanding. We are in the home stretch of this transition period and don?t anticipate any additional situations like this between now and inauguration? Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told reporters. ?We?ve really made an effort to provide as much access and comfort as possible over the past two weeks and are proud of the way we have all worked together.? A club member tweeted a picture of the   with himself at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter Florida which alerted reporters to the  ?s visit. The Jupiter club is about a half hour away from his    club in Palm Beach where he is staying. Trump?s motorcade was seen leaving the club around 2:15 p. m. ET. The press pool a small group of journalists assigned to cover the president exists to keep Americans informed about the president?s whereabouts. In the case of an emergency the president and his team often relies on journalists to quickly relay information to the American people. Trump has abandoned his press pool several times since his election victory in early November. After ditching the press twice in a week the White House Correspondents Association called the practice ?unacceptable.?
215,50376,Skakel murder case: Court reinstates conviction,CNN,,12/30/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Michael Skakel could be headed back to prison after the Connecticut Supreme Court on Friday reinstated his conviction in the 1975 murder of a    neighbor. Skakel the    nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy had spent more than a decade in prison for the killing of Martha Moxley until a judge in 2013 decided he did not receive adequate representation in his trial and ordered a new one. On Friday after Skakel had been free for three years the state?s high court overruled the decision. ?Because we conclude that the petitioner?s trial counsel rendered constitutionally adequate representation we reverse the judgment of the habeas court and remand the case to that court with direction to render judgment denying the petition? the state?s high court said in its decision. One of Skakel?s attorneys Stephan Seeger told CNN he was just becoming aware of the decision.  ?We haven?t had time to fully digest the opinion at this juncture but of course it?s a setback. We?re going to be dealing with other legal procedures that are available to avail Michael of any and all of his constitutional rights.? Skakel has always proclaimed his innocence. Moxley?s body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich Connecticut. Authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death a broken golf club was found near her body. In 2002 Skakel was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. In October 2012 he was denied parole but a year later a judge determined that the case presented by his defense attorney Michael ?Mickey? Sherman was ?constitutionally deficient.?  Sherman told CNN on Saturday he felt the judgement showed his approach was justified.  ?It vindicates the decision I made throughout the trial? Sherman said. ?But when you?re a criminal defense lawyer you have to be prepared do to everything you can to vindicate your client. I am willing to stick with that consequence.?  Sherman hasn?t spoken to Skakel since the trial ended in 2002 he said.  ?I feel badly for Michael Skakel. This revokes his bond and heightens the prospect he may go back to jail and I think he shouldn?t have been convicted in the first place? Sherman said.  Skakel was freed on bail in November 2013.  One of Skakel?s three previous appeals went to the US Supreme Court but in 2006 the justices declined to hear that petition. 
216,50377,Lake Erie plane crash: Police now searching for remains ,CNN,AnneClaire Stapleton,12/30/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Police announced Saturday they would begin a new search and recovery operation for the remains of the passengers from a small plane believed to have crashed in Lake Erie Thursday night. During a press conference on Saturday officials said investigators will build a grid and identify the plane?s last communication. A team of divers and marine experts will extract the remains.   The plane was registered to a beverage company executive and is based at Ohio State University Airport the airport?s director told CNN Friday.  The executive?s father John W. Fleming told the Columbus Dispatch that his son John T. Fleming was at the controls of the Cessna that went missing Thursday night after the pilot his family and friends attended a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball game. ?The airplane is based at our airport it left from the airport and it did not come home last night? Doug Hammon the airport?s director said Friday. Also on board the plane were Fleming?s wife Suzanne Fleming 46 their two sons John Robert 15 and Andrew Thomas 14 a neighbor and a neighbor?s daughter the pilot?s father told the newspaper. John T. Fleming an experienced pilot was taking his family and neighbors to the Cavaliers game as a treat for the holidays according to his father.  Fleming is president and CEO of Superior Beverage Group according to his LinkedIn page. The US Coast Guard and its Canadian counterpart searched the lake Friday but the mission was suspended at 7:30 p. m. spokeswoman Katelyn Waddle said.  Three adults and three children were on board the aircraft US Coast Guard Captain Michael Mullen told reporters Friday.  ?At this point we believe it?s [members of] two families? Mullen said of the missing.    The last radar contact with the plane came as it flew about two miles north of the Cleveland?s Burke Lakefront Airport where it took off according to Mullen.

Coast Guard Cutter Bristol Bay is also on its way from Detroit to help the Coast Guard said. The search operation was made ?very difficult? by   to   waves on Lake Erie the Coast Guard said. Air traffic control reported to the Coast Guard at about 11:30 p. m. on Thursday that the plane had just taken off from Burke Lakefront Airport in downtown Cleveland and ?dropped off radar about two miles when it was over Lake Erie? Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Christopher Yaw told CNN. The missing Cessna has room for up to 11 people but the plane?s flight plan indicates it had six people on board Yaw said. Ohio State University Airport where the plane was headed is certified for commercial service and serves as a research and teaching facility. The airport is owned and operated by the Ohio State College of Engineering according to its website.  
217,50379,UFC: Rousey?s comeback halted in first round by Nunes,CNN,Euan McKirdy,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Only 48 seconds after the opening bell the comeback was over.  Ronda Rousey the UFC?s   hope and the sport?s   athlete saw her chance to redeem her November 2015 loss to Holly Holm.  But almost straight away that dream was shattered by a prepared efficient and confident Amanda Nunes the women?s bantamweight champion whose defense of her belt was largely ignored in the   to the fight. ?Before I walked out (my team) talked and this moment was my moment? said the Brazilian who claimed her first successful defense of her July title. ?(Rousey) had her time she did a lot for the sport. I thank Ronda Rousey. But right now I showed I?m the champion and I?m here to stay.? The matchup was largely billed as the American challenger?s opportunity to regain some of the dominance she demonstrated for much of her career    right up to that shock defeat to Holm. She?s been away from the sport and down since that loss    even admitting to thoughts of suicide    and in preparation for Friday?s Las Vegas clash she kept largely out of the limelight. Ronda Rousey returns to the Octagon. But for how long? Partisan crowd At both the Thursday   and Friday night?s fight the fans were firmly behind the former bantamweight title holder and their cheers in the arena Friday were supposed to brush the cobwebs off after a   absence and to restore the   fighter to her former dominance. Following her November 2015 title loss in what was arguably the biggest upset the sport has ever seen and dropping to    Rousey retreated from the sport. This was supposed to be the night to put all that behind her.  But the current holder had different ideas. Latching on to a poor defensive posture from the California native Nunes battered her opponent with  a powerful left hook followed by a series of powerful rights ?the Lioness? relentlessly stalking her prey. ?I really trained very hard I?m a dedicated fighter and I have my team behind me? Nunes said. ?They?ve made me an amazing fighter. It?s unbelievable how American Top Team put me on another level.? Ronda Rousey keeps promise to attend Marine Corps Ball ?Definitely one of my last fights? Even before Friday?s   defeat there were strong hints that the end of the Olympic bronze medalist?s career might be on the horizon. On Ellen DeGeneres? show last month Rousey hinted that retirement may not be that far away. ?Not that long I?m wrapping it up? Rousey told DeGeneres. ?This is definitely one of my last fights. Everyone better watch. The show isn?t going to be around forever.? Before her loss to Holm Rousey didn?t just win. She completely dominated her opponents. In her run of 12 consecutive wins some took less than a minute such as when she took out Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds in February 2015. Back then Rousey using her vicious ?armbar? maneuver to neutralize opponents looked unstoppable.  But those days are over and while the official announcement hasn?t been made Nunes is already looking ahead. ?Forget about Ronda Rousey? Nunes said. ?Now she?s going to retire and go do movies.? Miracle at Leicester? Sporting upsets to remember
218,50381,Latino leaders ask: When will Trump reach out to Hispanics?,CNN,,12/31/2016,2016,12,,Washington (CNN) Latino leaders around the country say they want to keep an open mind about Donald Trump?s presidency but less than one month before Inauguration Day many are disappointed he has not done more to reach out to them. Since his election Trump has sat down with the likes of tech industry tycoons football heroes and even Kanye West.  But Latino leaders say there?s an urgent need for Trump to engage with the Hispanic community following a wrenching campaign in which he harshly singled out Mexican immigrants and called for tough immigration laws. The   has not met with Latino organization leaders in any official capacity since winning the election based on a review of his public meeting schedule. It?s a conspicuous snub considering Trump?s campaign rhetoric. He opened his White House bid in June 2015 by infamously labeling some Mexican immigrants as ?rapists? and accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the US. He also pledged to build a wall along the   border end birthright citizenship and deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country though he has since backed away from several of those stances. ?It is unacceptable that he has yet to build a relationship with Latino and Muslim communities that he has targeted the most throughout his campaign? said Hector Sanchez the chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda. ?Communities that are now suffering because of the things he said.?   Brent Wilkes the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the US said that it is unprecedented that the organization has still not heard from the  . ?We have always had Democratic and Republican presidents speak to us. Him not speaking to the Latino community is dividing this country? Wilkes said. Asked about whether Trump plans on reaching out to the Hispanic community Hope Hicks a transition spokeswoman said Trump ?will be a president for all Americans and will continue to reach out to specific groups and individuals as his Cabinet takes shape and he begins to execute plans for his first 100 days in office.? But Wilkes said a lack of Latino representation in Trump?s Cabinet is another issue that concerns the Hispanic community. As it currently stands with all but two of his Cabinet picks made Trump could be the first president in more than 24 years to not have someone of Latino heritage serve in his Cabinet. LULAC says the Trump transition team has not returned its phone calls. Michael Cohen a top adviser to Trump though he is not a member of the transition team told CNN that it?s possible LULAC didn?t reach the right people inside the transition and were they to contact him he would answer their calls.  Cohen also insisted that Trump?s transition team is making an effort to reach out to Hispanic groups but he was unable to provide information on which groups the transition team has met with. He also said Trump has future plans to reach out to the Latino community but he did not provide details. ?  Trump doesn?t forget the groups that came out to support him? Cohen said. ?And he does have plans to speak to the Latino community once he officially becomes president.? Javier Palomarez the president and CEO of United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce    which endorsed Trump?s opponent Hillary Clinton over the summer    said he speaks daily with Cohen. He acknowledged that the chamber ?might not agree on everything? with Trump but has a shared stake in growing the US economy. And there were a handful of Latinos present for a November 20 meeting in which Republican officials and what NBC News referred to as ?Trump insiders? sat down in Washington with leaders from   Latino Asian and Native American organizations. But Janet Murgua the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza the nation?s largest Latino advocacy organization said at a news conference in late November that Trump ?needs to reassure or at the very least address the fears of the communities of which he will now be president.? She added: ?  Trump we need you to protect and defend all Americans and condemn the violence and hate being committed in your name.? Asked about racial tensions in the wake of his election Trump told CBS News he was ?so saddened? to hear about threats and slurs hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. ?If it helps I will say this and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it? Trump told CBS? ?60 Minutes.? But there?s more the   can do to heal the country and reassure anxious Latinos about their place in Trump?s America Sanchez said. ?I am still hoping one day that we will have an open dialogue with the ? he said. ?We need to make sure that our voices are still heard and not forgotten in this new administration.?
219,50382,Putin congratulates Trump in New Year statement,CNN,,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated US   Donald Trump rather than President Barack Obama in his annual New Year?s greetings statement to foreign heads of state and government.  However Putin did convey his seasonal greetings to Obama his family and the American people in a separate statement earlier Friday while responding to the latest wave of US sanctions against Russia.  In his annual greetings statement Putin expressed hope that after Trump is sworn in as US President on January 20 the two countries ?acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner will be able to take real steps to restore the mechanisms of bilateral cooperation in various areas and take their interaction in the international arena to a whole new level.?  ?Major global and regional challenges that our countries have confronted in recent years clearly confirm that   relations are an important factor in ensuring stability and security in the modern world? reads Putin?s direct message to Trump released by the Kremlin on Friday. Trump: Putin ?very smart? Earlier Friday Putin said Moscow would not expel 35 American diplomats in response to US sanctions against Russia as had been recommended by the Russian Foreign Ministry and would ?not resort to irresponsible ?kitchen? diplomacy.? Trump responded with kind words for Putin tweeting Friday that he was ?very smart? for withholding reciprocal sanctions on the United States at least for the time being.  The Obama administration said its measures were in response to allegations that Russia had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election campaign. ?It is regrettable that the Obama Administration is ending its term in this manner? said Putin. ?Nevertheless I offer my New Year greetings to President Obama and his family.? READ: Breaking down the Putin Trump and Obama spy games Current former leaders congratulated In his annual greetings statement Putin also congratulated Britain?s Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Theresa May Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Chinese President Xi Jinping French President Franois Hollande German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu among others. Former heads of state and politicians including former US Presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi also received greetings from the Russian President.  Obama however was not mentioned in this year?s message.  Putin also congratulated Pope Francis UN   Ban   UN    Antonio Guterres International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.
220,50383,Kellyanne Conway?s husband on short list for top US lawyer job,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Kellyanne Conway?s husband could become the US government?s next top litigator. George Conway a corporate attorney who is married to one of   Donald Trump?s senior advisers is on the shortlist of candidates to be nominated as US solicitor general two sources familiar with the process told CNN.  Bloomberg News first reported that George Conway was being considered for the post which requires Senate approval. Conway who is of Filipino descent would be the first   solicitor general. George Conway declined to comment but one of the sources said he would accept the position should Trump tap him to be the government?s top litigator. The other source said he has been interviewed by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions Trump?s attorney  . The solicitor general is the Justice Department?s   ranking official and argues cases on the federal government?s behalf at the US Supreme Court. Kellyanne Conway meanwhile was tapped earlier this month to become counselor to the president once Trump is inaugurated next month. George Conway is a partner at the corporate law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen  Katz where he has worked for 28 years. He is currently a partner in the firm?s litigation department where he has honed his talents in securities contract and antitrust litigation according to his firm?s website. Throughout his career he has represented   clients including the National Football League and cigarette giant Philip Morris whom he represented in a successful defamation lawsuit against ABC News. Conway has already stood before the Supreme Court arguing a case before it in 2010 Morrison v. National Australia Bank. Conway graduated from Yale Law School in 1987 after attending Harvard College. He also clerked for US Circuit Judge Ralph Winter Jr. of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals who was nominated to the court by President Ronald Reagan. He was part of the team of lawyers in the 1990s who represented Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against   Bill Clinton. He helped write the Supreme Court brief in the case that would establish a legal precedent for a sitting president to be sued in civil court.
221,50384,Allan Williams The Beatles? first manager dies ,CNN,Euan McKirdy,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Allan Williams the club owner and promoter widely credited with the discovery of The Beatles has died. The music impresario who also supported the group through their earliest years was 86. Active on the Liverpudlian music scene for decades after his association with the pop group ended his passing was confirmed by The Jacarenda    a club he once owned and at which The Beatles played some of their earliest gigs.  ?Today is one of the saddest days in our history? a post on the club?s Facebook page reads. ?(Williams?) legacy has allowed us to remain at the heart of the Liverpool music scene for almost 60 years and his memory will live on through every band that plays our famous stage. ?Allan you will be missed.? The club also paid tribute to Williams via its Twitter page. Martin King of The Beatles Story museum in Liverpool also posted reaction on  the museum?s website. ?We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Allan Williams. Our thoughts go out to his family at this sad time? King said. The Beatles Story website noted the influence Williams had on the group?s early development.  ?Allan played a significant role in the story of the Beatles. His involvement in the Beatles? early years in Liverpool and onto Hamburg helped shape the band in to what we see and know today. He personally drove the van to take the young band to Hamburg Germany in 1960 where they gained the vital show business experience that led to their emergence on the world stage.? It also notes that Williams was earlier in 2016 given the Citizen of Honour award by the City of Liverpool. Williams? death also was widely reported in British media Saturday. Attempts made by CNN to reach a spokesman for Williams? family were unsuccessful. Early gigs The Jacaranda connection has become part of The Beatles legend. Local media recounts that in response to requests from the band to play the   shop Williams required them to help redecorate John Lennon and   Stuart Sutcliffe painting a mural in the ladies bathroom.  The band eventually played gigs there between May and August 1960 according to the Liverpool Echo. Williams who wrote an autobiography titled ?The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away? not only booked the band for performances during their very earliest years he also drove the band then comprised of Lennon Sutcliffe Paul McCartney George Harrison and Pete Best to Hamburg for an extended stay in the German city.  Hamburg developments The Hamburg years a series of visits to the port city from 1960 to 1962 honed their style and brought them to prominence and eventually the attention of their longtime manager Brian Epstein.

223,50386,Get ready for another year of global tumult,CNN,Stephen Collinson,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) The political tumult that rocked the world in 2016 might be an appetizer for 2017. Crucial elections loom this year in France and Germany where the same   backlash that produced Donald Trump and Brexit could offer an opening to nationalist leaders who oppose Muslim immigration and further erode the European unity that has been a signature of the   War II era.  The Middle East is spiraling deeper into the mire of fraying borders and sectarian disorder while violence in places such Syria is unleashing a tide of desperate refugees that is destabilizing Europe. Meanwhile rising powers such as China Russia and Iran are closely watching the developments to determine whether the convulsions in the West give them an opening to advance their own interests. Of course the 15 years since the September 11 attacks have been dominated by war strife and economic disruption. But what makes 2017 so unique is that America    long a force for stability    is poised to inaugurate one of the most impulsive presidents ever to walk into the Oval Office.  Far from acting as a brake against turmoil sweeping the globe America under Trump could exacerbate it. Nicholas Dungan an Atlantic Council senior fellow said uncertainty about the   could widen divides in the transatlantic alliance the bedrock of 70 years of Western stability. ?Donald Trump is in many respects the   Obama? said Dungan who teaches at Sciences Po an international research university in France. ?With Obama there was tremendous trust but very little performance. With Trump it looks like there will be a deficit of trust and a surfeit of action.?  World on edge It?s no wonder that Trump has the world on edge despite arguments among supporters that the unpredictable statesmanship he has previewed in the presidential transition could strengthen the US position around the globe by keeping rivals off balance. He has questioned US alliances that kept the peace for decades in Europe and Asia and suggested he will ?expand? the US nuclear arsenal. He has spent his transition feuding with spy agencies that concluded Russia interfered in the election. And he signaled to China that the taboo topic of Taiwan is on the table casting doubt on 40 years of diplomatic protocol. The Trump effect could be all the more pronounced because the political equilibrium of much of the world has been upset straining institutions and assumptions in international relations that have endured for decades. To judge how much has changed and why the prospects of 2017 look so uncertain it?s worth looking back a year. When 2016 dawned Obama fresh from an Iran nuclear deal and seeing Obamacare upheld by the Supreme Court had every reason to expect a Democratic successor would secure his legacy. Republicans were confidently waiting for an establishment champion to emerge from their primary to send Trump back to reality TV. In Britain David Cameron was basking in a surprising parliamentary majority won in a 2015 election. Most    polls predicted the Remain camp would win a referendum on membership in the European Union. In Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel Time Magazine?s reigning Person of the Year was lauded for her moral example in embracing desperate refugees from the Middle East and was Europe?s undisputed leader. And in Italy Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was readying a trip to the US to receive Obama?s blessing after harnessing hope and change as a successful political message of his own. Unthinkable happened again and again and again But within months the unthinkable happened    again and again and again. In a blink of an eye Cameron was gone felled by a referendum in which voters who felt economically and culturally dispossessed opted to leave the EU. Trump won the US election after a vitriolic campaign that tore at social cultural and political divides and left the rest of the world confused about American power and identity. Renzi is history crushed   by his own referendum defeat which dealt a second hammer blow to the EU. And Merkel rocked by a   terror attack in Berlin faces a fight for political survival in a fall election hinging on immigration politics and a right wing resurgence spurred by her open door refugee policy. In France where Islamic terrorism has become more frequent President Francois Hollande acknowledged his dismal approval rating and nixed a   bid. The best hedge against an earthquake election win in May by far right national front leader Marine Le Pen is France?s   election system that could unite opposition against her. A March election in the Netherlands promises a strong showing by far right leader Geert Wilders built on skepticism towards Brussels that is threatening the existence of the EU. Still if Merkel or an establishment rival prevails in Germany and the hot favorite in the polls to win the French presidency Francois Fillon is also victorious 2017 could be remembered as the year the populist revolt began to ebb. Adversaries mobilize As the West reels its adversaries are mobilizing. Russian President Vladimir Putin defied Obama?s predictions his venture in Syria would end in a quagmire. Now he seems on the way to restoring the lost Russian influence that he watched ebb in despair after the fall of the Soviet Union.  In Asia Chinese President Xi Jinping is accelerating that country?s accumulation of regional power and challenging US influence and allies in the South China Sea. A volatile President in the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is trashing a prized US alliance. Trump?s rejection of a vast   Partnership trade pact has already empowered China and undermined eight years of Obama?s Asia pivot.  The instability and uncertainty makes the choices Trump makes once he is inaugurated in January especially crucial. Should the new administration follow through on the  ?s tough rhetoric on China and take protectionist steps that could incite a trade war tensions in Asia could spike considerably. If Trump walks out on the Iran nuclear deal or infringes the Paris climate pact he could send transatlantic relations into a spiral. Aligning the US closer to Moscow could also alarm European allies unless he makes a   defense of NATO on his first trip to the continent. Asian allies Japan and South Korea are nervously trying to work out what Trump?s campaign trail rhetoric means for crucial national security infrastructure in Asia. North Korea meanwhile is brewing what could be Trump?s first big foreign crisis with its race for a functioning nuclear arsenal.  In the Middle East Trump?s vow to move the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv could light a match to   antagonism and put US Arab allies in a tough spot. Could Trump?s strategy work? Of course there?s no certainty that Trump will plunge the world into a new spiral of instability. Major policy shifts can be disorienting but they aren?t always negative. Every President?s foreign policy is in some ways a correction to that of his predecessor. So Trump?s spontaneity could perhaps be an antidote to Obama?s caution which some critics said frittered away US power. Questioning trade deals alliances and conventions could actually end up strengthening the US at home and in the world Trump supporters argue. And just because the One China policy has dictated relations between Washington and Beijing for decades does not mean it should always be so they say. Trump?s naval buildup meanwhile could reassure US allies who feel bullied by China. And in an era of strongman leaders like Xi Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a    US President might keep American rivals off balance. Foreign policy often begins at home. And if tax cuts and slashing regulation ignites explosive economic growth a Trump boom could help lift anemic economies in Euorope and Asia. Those who hope Trump will not upset the geopolitical apple cart also question whether responsibility will sober the  . ?There?s just a whole different attitude and vibe when you?re not in power as when you?re in power? Obama said in his   press conference. ?What we have to see is how will the   operate and how will his team operate when they?ve been fully briefed on all these issues they have their hands on all the levers of government and they?ve got to got to start making decisions.?
224,50387,California earthquake swarm rocks New Year?s Eve,CNN,,1/1/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Dozens of earthquakes helped bring in the New Year around Brawley California but they are more of a curiosity than a concern experts tell CNN. Caltech seismologist Lucy Jones said earthquake ?swarms? aren?t unexpected around Brawley    there also was a swarm in 2012    because the   region called the Brawley Seismic Zone lies between the large San Andreas Fault and the Imperial Fault. More than 100 earthquakes have hit the region this weekend but most are too weak under 2. 5 magnitude to be noticed by people said Donyelle Davis spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey.  Weak quakes can trigger a bigger more dangerous quake but Brawley a city of about 25 000 people near the Mexican border is too far from the San Andreas Fault for that to be much of a risk Davis said. ?This area may have produced the most earthquakes in the entire state of California but they are small? Jones said. ?If they happened a mile away  we would be concerned but these quakes are about 30 miles from the San Andreas Fault.? Since Saturday at least 24 quakes have been 2. 5 to 3. 9 magnitude according to the Geological Survey. Earthquakes of 3. 9 magnitude or less generally create little or no damage.  They are common in California. As of noon Sunday the state had had 191 earthquakes in the past 24 hours and 7 707 in the past 365 days with the largest measuring 6. 5 in Ferndale according to the website earthquaketracker. com.  Catastrophic earthquakes seem to strike along the southern San Andreas Fault about once every 150 years the  Geological Survey said citing studies examining the past 1 400 years. The last time an enormous temblor on the fault struck Southern California was in 1857.
225,50388,Obama to deliver farewell speech in Chicago,CNN,Allie Malloy,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Honolulu Hawaii (CNN) President Barack Obama will deliver his farewell address to the nation on January 10 from his home city of Chicago the President announced in a statement Monday.  ?I?m thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey to celebrate the ways you?ve changed this country for the better these past eight years and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here? Obama wrote.  President Obama said he was following the precedent set by George Washington who penned a farewell address to the American people over 220 years ago. Obama defends his legacy on Twitter George W. Bush also delivered a farewell address in 2009 from the White House.  ?Since 2009 we?ve faced our fair share of challenges and come through them stronger? Obama wrote Monday. ?That?s because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding    our conviction that together we can change this country for the better.? President Obama has said that while he won?t weigh in on every issue once he is out of the White House he would consider speaking up about issues that go to ?core questions? about American values and ideals.  Chicago is where President Obama got his start in politics after graduating from Harvard Law School and where the first family called home before moving to the White House. Obama?s presidential library will also be located in Chicago.
226,50389,How Trump made hatred profitable for Milo,CNN,Ruth Ben-Ghiat,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN)?America?s favorite mischievous gay conservative? is how publisher Simon  Schuster bills its newest   author Milo Yiannopoulos.  The news that the Breitbart senior editor had received a reported $250 000 advance for his book ?Dangerous? (to be published in March 2017) has set the publishing and literary worlds aflame (Breitbart itself is already calling it ?booklash. ?) For Milo (he goes by one name) is no ordinary writer but a media figure who has made himself famous for his   extremist views.  Positioning himself as the defender of victimized white males he goes after those he sees as their antagonists: feminists people of color and immigrants cloaking his hate speech under the mantle of the right to free expression. He?s banned for life from Twitter (for his harassment of   actor Leslie Jones). So why on earth would Simon  Schuster give him a platform? Profit for one thing. ?Dangerous? immediately went to the top of Amazon. com?s bestseller list on the strength of its  . The media opportunities generated by the publishing house?s parent company CBS will likely compensate for any boycotts that materialize (the Chicago Review of Books has announced it would not review any Simon  Schuster books in 2017 as a protest and others from indie booksellers to celebrities are talking about boycotts). There?s also the issue of freedom of speech. Opinion is divided even among liberals about whether Milo and his book should be censored. Where are the boundaries about what?s fit for public circulation and who should decide or enforce them? This same debate arose last year in Germany on the occasion of the reissue of Adolf Hitler?s Mein Kampf which had been banned in Germany since the end of World War II. For every reader who came away from reading it disgusted by the violence of fascism the concern was that there could be others inspired by exactly that. In the United States many of Milo?s fans are also supporters of   Donald Trump. Milo sees Trump the political disrupter as a kindred spirit. As he noted at the opening of the art show #DaddyWillSaveUs (during which he sat almost naked in a tub full of cow blood to honor Americans killed by undocumented immigrants) Trump?s ?Make America Great Again? has revived ?the dissident element in culture    punk mischief irreverence. ..? Such boosterism apparently made Milo a good fit for Simon  Schuster?s Threshold imprint which publishes not only Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh but also Trump himself (most recently ?Great Again: How to Fix our Crippled America?). By signing Milo?s ?Dangerous? the publishing house simply makes more evident what Trump?s campaign already proved: for today?s GOP racist rhetoric has become normal political discourse. The risk that hateful rhetoric could become an inspiration for rather than a deterrent against hateful action is particularly relevant in Milo?s case since his behavior raises the question of the link between dangerous speech online and    actions    a connection that came up repeatedly during our recent Presidential campaign.  Milo is above all a performer who lives for the attention    in the form of outrage    his theater of bigotry brings. At the University of Wisconsin (a stop on his ?Dangerous Faggot? college campus tour) Milo harassed a transgender student in person at DePaul University he claimed he had had sex with the brothers of his black female protesters and called for their arrest. Nothing?s off limits to Milo and his fans like it that way. And this is the real storyline of Milo?s book deal: far from being ?mischievous? Milo is a barometer for the far rightward shift and expansion of the conservative movement in America to elevate figures that traffic in violent speech.  In fact if we look closely Milo and Trump have more in common than one might think. Both have outsized egos and platforms but have chosen to target ordinary citizens on Twitter leading in some cases to their followers issuing threats to their targets? safety (including rape if that target is a woman).  Both mock those who are ?different? (Trump the disabled Milo transgender people). Both are longstanding misogynists. Both continually test their audiences to see what they can get away with and believe the rules won?t apply to them.  A year ago Trump told the press what he thought of the immunity granted him by his own popularity: ?I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and I wouldn?t lose voters.? And Milo had this to say in the wake of his book deal: ?I?m more powerful more influential and more fabulous than ever before and this book is the moment Milo goes mainstream. Social justice warriors should be scared    very scared.?    So while Milo may seem a unique figure in reality he merely serves up with the flash of excess and a British accent the attitudes toward people of color and women that marked the Trump campaign.  Lest you doubt that listen to Milo and then revisit the videos of Trump?s campaign rallies. See the faces contorted with hatred and listen to the chants wishing violence on his opponent Hillary Clinton. Watch as Trump supporters whose skin is too dark for the crowd?s liking are manhandled and ejected as happened in North Carolina and elsewhere. We can debate endlessly the logic or morality of Simon  Schuster?s giving Milo a lucrative deal but ultimately the responsibility for the climate that made this professional hater a bankable figure is the GOP?s and Trump?s own.
227,50390,Istanbul attack: ISIS claims nightclub shooting killer still at large,CNN,Euan McKirdy,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Istanbul (CNN) ISIS claimed responsibility for the New Year?s attack at Istanbul?s Reina nightclub that left 39 people dead but authorities are still scrambling to find the killer.  ISIS? claim made in a statement posted to Twitter cannot be independently verified by CNN. But it boasted about the first major terrorist attack of 2017.  ?In continuation of the blessed operations which ISIS carries out against Turkey a soldier of the brave caliphate attacked one of the most popular nightclubs while Christians were celebrating their holiday? the statement read. Both Turkish and US officials have called the attack an act of terrorism.  Here?s the latest on the investigation the victims and why Turkey keeps getting targeted:   The investigation Investigators have found the fingerprints of the suspect and know what he looks like Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Monday.  Eight people have been detained in connection with the attack Kurtulmus said but the suspect was not among them.  ?We will find him no delay? Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said. Footage of the attacker showed him shooting a security guard and police officer at the entrance of the nightclub. Turkish authorities said they believe he carried out the attack alone. Earlier Monday the militant Kurdistan Worker?s Party or PKK distanced itself from the attack.  ?No Kurdish forces have anything to do with this attack? the PKK said. ?The Kurdish freedom fight is also the fight for democratization of Turkey. That?s why we won?t target innocent and civilian people.? The victims Those killed in the attack were from 14 countries including India Morocco Jordan Canada Russia Tunisia Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Security guard Fatih Cakmak was one of the first victims killed. He had considered himself lucky after surviving a December attack outside Istanbul?s Vodafone Arena where he was also working security.   ?He went to work and now he?s gone? said his father Hassan Cakmak who said he can?t believe he survived his    son. Lubna Ghaznawi a young female entrepreneur from Saudi Arabia was also killed. The    worked   as a communications manager for one of Saudi Arabia?s largest banks and also   a   with her sister called Exclusave Card the first student discount card in Saudi Arabia. ?She was an optimist and loved going to new places? her friend Seham   told CNN. ?Laughter and happiness filled whatever place she went to.?  Dozens of people were hospitalized. As of Monday 46 were still being treated including one American according to the Istanbul governor?s office. A handful of the injured were in critical condition. ?We were having fun? Witnesses described how the festive evening turned into a bloodbath. ?We were having fun. At first we thought it was a fight then there was a lot of gunfire? witness Yunus Turk told CNN. ?After the gunfire everyone started to run toward the terrace. We ran as well. There was someone next to me who was shot and fell on the floor. We ran away and hid under the sofas.?  READ: International community mourns Turkey attack victims Another witness said he didn?t know how many attackers there were but he saw one person and hid.  ?I got shot in the f****** leg man? he told journalists as he was taken into an ambulance. ?These crazy people came in shooting everything.? On Sunday the club issued a statement on its Facebook page. ?This terrible incident is a terror attack against our citizens? peace brotherhood serenity economy tourism and against our nation? the statement read.  ?Our hearts bleed and the bullets are in our heart.?  Why Turkey keeps getting targeted Turkey?s deputy prime minister said he believes the attack was committed in response to Operation Euphrates Shield Turkey?s ground operation against ISIS in Syria.  But the country is ?fighting a   war    against the Kurdish Workers? Party and against the Islamic State? CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer said.  Turkey shares a   ( ) border with Syria making it relatively easy for ISIS fighters and supplies to cross.  ?That border is so porous    weapons explosives people coming across it? Baer said.  Both ISIS and Kurdish militants have launched attacks in Turkey which is also reeling from a bloody and failed military coup in July. Officials suspect ISIS was responsible for the attack on Ataturk Airport in June that left 44 people dead and an explosion at an August wedding that killed at least 54 people. ISIS has typically refrained from claiming responsibility for attacks in Turkey to create ?an environment of suspicion in Turkish politics? analyst Soner Cagaptay wrote for CNN last year.   So ISIS? claim of responsibility for Sunday?s nightclub attack could mark a turning point.  ?I think with Istanbul it?s a declaration of war on Turkey? Baer said.  Meanwhile Turkish security forces clash almost daily with rebel PKK militants mostly in predominantly Kurdish parts of southeastern Turkey. In December a pair of bombings in Istanbul killed 44 people and wounded 155 others in an attack by a breakaway group of the PKK. The two explosions occurred after a heavily attended soccer game at Besiktas Vodafone Arena. Also in December a car bomb exploded near a public bus killing 13 soldiers in the central province of Kayseri. Three days later a gunman assassinated Russia?s ambassador to Turkey at an Ankara art gallery.  ?The issue of a copycat? So how could the attack at the Reina nightclub have implications elsewhere?  Since the assailant used a gun and apparently started by killing the security guard a similar attack could happen anywhere CNN senior law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said.  ?You have the issue of a copycat? he said. ?So here in the United States  we have over 300 million guns at large in our population. So we?re talking about one person getting a hold of one of those guns and launching an attack and doing it on his own. . .. So it?s almost impossible to stop if that?s what we end up with    a lone wolf who wants to get a gun.?

229,50392,Trump?s Russia claims drive this week in politics,CNN,Eric Bradner,1/1/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump claims to have inside information on Russia?s meddling in the United States? election    and promises to reveal it ?Tuesday or Wednesday.?  At a New Year?s Eve party at his    estate a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the election intrusion. ?It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don?t know and so they cannot be sure of the situation? he said. Liberal groups want delay of Sessions hearing Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew Trump said: ?You?ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.? The latest developments in Trump?s denial of the American intelligence community?s assessment    widely accepted by both Democrats and Republicans    that Russia hacked Democratic operatives? emails in a bid to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton will be among the leading political stories this week as Trump?s transition efforts resume and a new Congress is sworn in.  Here are five other political stories to watch this week:  Trump vs. the GOP on Russia The Russia hacks aren?t just driving a wedge between Trump and the Obama administration.  Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are backing Obama?s moves last week to sanction Russia and are calling for legislation to add even more sanctions on top of those announced by the White House.  The Senate Armed Services Committee chaired by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain will hold a hearing on cyberthreats and the   hacking Thursday.  The issue could set the tone for relations between Trump and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate.  New Congress kicks off The newly elected Congress will begin its work Tuesday at noon with a vote to officially   Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as House speaker.  Several new faces will appear in Congress including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Republican Florida governor and Senate candidate Charlie Crist who is set to become a Democratic congressman. So will Florida?s Brian Mast a Republican and Army veteran who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan.  An old face meanwhile will appear in the Senate. Vice President Joe Biden will be back in the body where he spent more than three decades to swear in new senators including California?s Kamala Harris and Nevada?s Catherine Cortez Masto who replaces retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.  Hill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017 The Senate will quickly move toward confirmation battles over Trump?s nominees    with Democrats complaining that nominees aren?t submitting materials they?ve requested including their financial information and shouldn?t get hearings and votes until those are provided.  House Republicans meanwhile will condemn the Obama administration?s handling of a United Nations vote on Israeli settlements on the West Bank. And House Democrats are opposing a   rule change that would impose new fines for members who break rules of decorum. It?s an effort to stop Democrats from using platforms such as Periscope and Meerkat to     on the House floor as they did last year.  Obamacare strategy session President Barack Obama will make an unusual trip for a   president    visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss how to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to push the repeal of Obama?s signature domestic achievement in the first week of the new Congress.  Democrats meanwhile face a defining moment in the early stages of the Trump era: If party members pledge not to help the GOP pass any replacement it would place enormous pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans to come up with a way to keep 20 million Americans insured    and get Congress to approve such a program.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold a conference call with House Democrats Monday on Obamacare.  What else can Obama get done before leaving office? He?s still working toward closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and could make additional pardons. His farewell speech will also be formally announced Monday.  Filling out the Cabinet After a holiday getaway at his    estate Trump has several cabinet positions left to fill.  He?s expected to soon announce his choices for secretary of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture.  Other key roles remain unfilled as well    including solicitor general where top aide Kellyanne Conway?s husband George Conway is reportedly a candidate as well as Director of National Intelligence and deputy secretary of state.  Trump to give deposition Trump will attempt to conclude a piece of older business this week with a deposition at Trump Tower this week.  The deposition comes as part of Trump?s legal battle with the chef Jose Andres.  Andres was supposed to launch a restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington. But after Trump?s attacks on Mexicans as he began his presidential campaign in June 2015 Andres withdrew and Trump sued him for breach of contract.

230,50393,Mark Shriver to Trump: Don?t forget about children the poor ,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Chicago (CNN) As Congress returns and Washington readies for a new president the leader of a children?s advocacy group?s political arm fears that vulnerable children and other   communities might have much to lose from Donald Trump?s agenda. Mark Shriver head of Save the Children Action Network expressed concerns with the policy priorities of the incoming Donald Trump administration  ?   personal and corporate tax cuts increases in defense spending reductions in entitlements  ?   and what it could mean for the vulnerable communities that have marginal influence in Washington. ?They don?t have political sway. They?re not making big campaign contributions? Shriver told David Axelrod on ?The Axe Files? podcast produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. ?And when the cuts are made they?re the ones who don?t have the biggest voice and they?re the most vulnerable.? To subscribe to The Axe Files click here. Instead of cutting programs for children Shriver wants to see Congress recommit to initiatives like early childhood education which has garnered bipartisan support at the state and local level and has shown results. ?Those first five years of life when 90% of brain growth happens I think is the biggest social justice issue in this country? argued Shriver because poor children are developing at a slower pace than more affluent children for want of resources and a proper learning environment. ?It?s outrageous that we don?t do more as a country? Shriver continued. ?I wish the leadership in Washington would see what?s going on in the states and make a commitment to our poor kids before they enter kindergarten.? During the conversation Shriver touched on the personal impact that his parents  ?   Sargent Shriver the first director of the Peace Corps and Eunice Kennedy Shriver a driving force behind the Special Olympics  ?   had on him. It was their Catholic faith and commitment to helping the poor and vulnerable that contributed to his decision to pursue a career in public service Shriver says. While his commitment to public service never wavered Shriver says that his faith underwent a test of confidence as he felt increasingly disconnected from the church of his youth and descended into what he called ?a Catholic funk.? Then Pope Francis began his papacy through very public and humble gestures of charity  ?   asking for the blessing of the crowd at St. Peter?s Square before he blessed them washing the feet of juvenile offenders even paying his own hotel bill. Shriver could see that this pope was different but he wasn?t certain if it was genuine. ?These are all gestures that kind of clearly caught my attention and made me wonder are these publicity stunts in order to garner positive PR for the church or is this guy the real deal?? Shriver said. He was determined to find out. Driven by a need for greater understanding of the roots of Pope Francis?s faith and a desire to renew his own Shriver set out to learn more about the new pope through his journey from Jesuit priest and reformist bishop in Buenos Aires to leader of the world?s 1. 2 billion Catholics a remarkable path that he chronicles in his new book ?Pilgrimage: My Search for the Real Pope Francis.? Shriver answering emphatically that Pope Francis is indeed ?the real deal? believes his power comes in part from his ability to challenge individuals to do their part to make our communities stronger and more compassionate. ?I think that?s why people respond to him? Shriver said. ?Because great leadership whether they?re political or religious ask us to get beyond our self. .. And they inspire us to go into our soul and to try to make connection with our neighbors. Not build walls and isolate us right? And that?s what great leaders do and I think that?s what he?s doing.? Whether Pope Francis who is 80 can build a legacy strong enough to withstand the more traditional elements within the institutional arm of the Catholic Church is a question Shriver cannot answer but he is certain that the Pope has already left a lasting impact. ?The way [Pope Francis] treats people on the fringes. ..he?s sending a message to all of us? stated Shriver. ?I think it?s going to be hard to backtrack on that.?

231,50394,Hill Republicans eye busy first 100 days of 2017,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)?Buckle up? was the advice Vice   Mike Pence gave Hill Republicans about the hectic pace ahead for Capitol Hill?s first 100 days in 2017.  The   Congress returns Tuesday to begin an aggressive push on a range of policies that their new partner      Donald Trump    can help turn into law.  The focus in January will be to start the wheels in motion to repeal the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare and vote to confirm many of Trump?s Cabinet nominees. There will also be debate about Russia?s interference in the 2016 presidential election    an issue the incoming President doesn?t want to focus on saying last week it?s time to ?move on?    but many in his own party view as a serious threat.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming to secure confirmation for many of Trump?s top national security and economic team members around the time he is sworn in on January 20. While Democrats don?t have the votes to block Trump?s nominees they are signaling an intense fight nevertheless. They are planning to leverage the   committee hearings to draw contrasts with Republicans on key issues like health care the environment and foreign policy. Obamacare repeal ?Repeal and replace? has been the regular Republican refrain from virtually the day President Barack Obama?s signature health care law became law in 2010.  McConnell announced last month that the first vote of the new Congress will be to start dismantling Obamacare. The President isn?t going quietly. Obama is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a rare meeting with all House and Senate Democrats to ?discuss fighting GOP plans to repeal (the Affordable Care Act)? according to a senior Senate Democratic aide. The   visit signals that the President will be personally involved defending the law that stands as his most important domestic policy legacy. Now that they have a GOP president to actually sign legislation that rolls back the law congressional Republicans are acknowledging that it?s complicated to simultaneously repeal Obamacare and put something else in its place. They control both the House and the Senate but they are limited because they don?t have 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster that would be expected on efforts to get rid of Obamacare.  Their plan is to use a budget process known as ?reconciliation? to wipe away the major planks of Obamacare. The Senate will begin debating a budget resolution this week as the first step. That allows them to use the procedure to pass the repeal in the Senate with a simple majority avoiding an expected Democratic filibuster. Reconciliation rules do limit the items in the law that can be rolled back to those that have a direct impact on the federal budget and Republicans still don?t have all the details ready on which ones they will include.  Democrats are preparing an aggressive public relations campaign to highlight how Obamacare has helped the 20 million now covered because of the law and the other benefits they believe have occurred such as better preventive care. On a conference call with House Democrats last week House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted that the ACA lowered costs and improved outcomes for millions. She compared the fight ahead against Republicans to the one she led in 2005 and 2006 when   George W. Bush traveled around the country championing a proposal to privatize Social Security a plan that didn?t gain traction with the public or in Congress. Events in House congressional districts are planned for January 7 and Senate Democrats are also teeing up several events in Washington this week to remind people about the elements of Obamacare they believe are popular.  Pelosi incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced that January 15 is a national ?Our First Stand: Save Health Care? day of action for advocacy groups and Democrats to criticize Republicans for working to target the health care law as well as other entitlement programs such as Medicare. While Republicans can pass the budget measure relatively quickly over a few weeks to begin unwinding Obamacare the package that will contain the actual plans for repealing the law will take at least a couple of months to develop. Several committees in both the House and Senate will weigh in with their stamps on the details including which taxes will go and which ones may need to remain in place until a new replacement plan is put in place. Democrats are also bracing for a big fight over funding for Planned Parenthood an issue that has triggered multiple standoffs in the past with the GOP. It?s unclear whether Republicans will include a ban on funding for the women?s health care provider because of its role in providing abortion services as part of the initial budget bill. There is no consensus yet on when to address the issue but conservatives are pressing for action soon and view the reconciliation process as the place to tackle it. Republicans are also struggling to come to consensus on how quickly they need to lay out their proposal to stand up a new health care system to take Obamacare?s place. Conservatives are insisting they limit any transition period to two years.   But GOP leaders are wary that once they begin unraveling the complicated federal and state programs now providing coverage it will take three years or more to practically implement a new system. Multiple Republican aides say it?s more likely that replacement plans will be voted on in a piecemeal fashion over multiple years perhaps even after the 2018 midterm elections to ensure there are not major marketplace disruptions or economic fallout for insurers states or the private sector. Confirmation battles Trump?s transition team describes the mix of business leaders and former military leaders selected for Cabinet posts as a group of outsiders set to shakeup the way Washington works. Republicans are confident that they have solid support and will get help of many of the red state Democrats like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin to confirm them. So far Rex Tillerson the oil company CEO Trump tapped to serve as secretary of state is the only pick who is raising some concerns with a handful of Republicans. They want more information about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and how he will deal with myriad foreign policy issues where the US has tangled with Russia like Syria Iran and recent cyberattacks.   Democrats are complaining that Tillerson and many other Cabinet nominees have been ?very slow? in providing information to the committees ahead of the upcoming hearings that committee chairs are targeting to hold in the second week in January. They are threatening to drag out votes on nominees if they don?t receive complete financial disclosure and ethics reports in advance of hearings so Senators can review the materials. Who?s in Trump?s Cabinet? ?Republicans shouldn?t expect their nominees to sail through if those nominees won?t provide the disclosure that past nominees provided and that senators and the American public deserve? Matt House a spokesman for Schumer told CNN.  Any delay would just be symbolic but if Democrats use the full amount of debate time allowed under Senate rules then a vote on each nominee that would normally take place in one or two days could stretch out a week. That could mean it could take months to clear through all of the president?s nominees if Democrats decide to put up a fight and other priorities like Obamacare repeal could also be delayed.  Democrats have been critical of virtually every person Trump has selected but they realize they can?t wage war on all of them. In addition to highlighting conflicts Tillerson?s business dealings might present multiple Senate Democratic sources say they are digging into the stock trades of Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price Trump?s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.   Under the law known as the ?STOCK Act? Price has disclosed information about his trades involving health and pharmaceutical company stocks. One senior Democratic leadership aide suggested they view the issue of conflicts arising from votes in Price?s post as budget chair coming around the time of these financial transactions as ?seriously seriously troubling.? There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Price. Phil Blando a spokesman for Trump?s transition team had previously told CNN Price ?complied fully with all applicable laws and ethics rules governing his personal finances.? And if confirmed would comply with the law Blando added. Russian hacking Obama?s announcement last week of new sanctions against Russia for its cyberattacks during the presidential election are putting Hill Republicans in a tough spot. Virtually all the top GOP leaders in Congress publicly backed the sanctions although they criticized how long it took to put them in place along with the administration?s overall foreign policy.  US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia carried out a steady and deliberate cyberoperation targeting top Democrats email accounts and the Democratic National Committee.  Senate Armed Service Chairman John McCain   is holding a Thursday hearing on the threat posed by foreign governments targeting US computer systems including Russia which will be the first public hearing since agencies revealed the links they found to Russia in the attacks. Get ready for another year of global tumult   McCain along with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham have vowed to draft legislation imposing additional sanctions to penalize Russia and Democrats have agreed to craft a bipartisan proposal. Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have publicly denounced Russia?s moves but any bipartisan push to move sanctions legislation puts them in the precarious spot of using valuable time in the first 100 days of the new administration on an issue that puts them at odds with Trump. Floor fight over rules Democrats are criticizing new Republican proposed rules governing decorum in the chamber of the House of Representatives. In response to a summer   that Democrats used to take over the House floor GOP leaders are adding a provision to impose fines as high as $2 500 for any member who uses social media application to broadcast activities from the floor. Some Democrats are calling the proposal ?unconstitutional? ?a gag rule? and ?Putinesque? but the changes are expected to pass. It?s unclear if a legal challenge could force the GOP to back down.
232,50395,Venomous ?Scorpion King? scores wonder goal,CNN,By John Sinnott CNN,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) A ?scorpion? is suddenly a new danger for English Premier League goalkeepers. Sunderland keeper Jordan Pickford was the first to experience the venom of a scorpion kick in Manchester United?s   win at Old Trafford on December 26. Henrikh Mkhitaryan connected with a cross that was behind him but the Armenian still managed to flick the ball with the back of his heel into the net. On Sunday it was Crystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey that was left with a bitter taste in his mouth after Olivier Giroud produced an equally outrageous scorpion kick to give Arsenal the lead in a   win that kept Arsene Wenger?s side in the Premier League title race. Giroud attributed his goal to ?maximum luck.? ?It?s not difficult to say that is the best one because I think I needed good help to score this goal? Giroud told the Arsenal website. ?Thanks God I was a bit lucky but it was the only thing I could do. The ball was behind me and I tried the back heel and obviously after that it was all about luck.? READ: Malaysian shortlisted in FIFA Puskas award READ: Liverpool stay in touch with Chelsea READ: Ronaldo?s $315M Chinese rumor While Giroud admitted Mkhitaryan?s effort had ?maybe inspired? him former Arsenal striker Ian Wright described the French international?s effort as ?the best Arsenal goal I?ve ever seen the most beautiful goal an Arsenal player has ever scored.? Palace keeper Hennessey described Giroud?s effort as a goal of the season contender though he was more prosaic in describing the beauty of the Frenchman?s strike. ?I just think he sticks a leg out and it hits him in the right area but Giroud?s goal is up there for goal of the season? Hennessey told the Croydon Advertiser. ?It?s the best goal scored against me anyway.? Arguably it was a goalkeeper that produced the most outrageous incarnation of the scorpion kick. During an international friendly with England in 1995 Colombia goalkeeper Rene Higuita morphed his body into the shape of a scorpion to clear a cross from Jamie Redknapp with both heels. A scorpion kick goal    scored by Simon Skrabb for Swedish side Atvidabergs    is also on FIFA?s goal of the year award.

233,50396,How your gut?s circadian rhythm affects your whole body,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,,We?ve known that bacteria live in our intestines as far back as the 1680s when Leeuwenhoek first looked through his microscope.  Yogurt companies use that information in the sales pitch for their product claiming it can help keep your gut bacteria happy.  The bacteria growing on our skin have also been effectively exploited to sell the underarm deodorants without which we can become ahem malodorous.  Until fairly recently our various microbes were thought of as freeloaders without any meaningful benefit to our functioning as healthy human beings. However that view has changed in a big way over the last couple of decades. Interest in and knowledge about the microbiota has recently exploded. These highly diverse communities of microbes live in and on us in staggering numbers researchers now estimate that a typical human body is made up of about 30 trillion human cells and 39 trillion bacteria. We now recognize they?re essential to our health participating in many important physiological functions such as digestion and metabolism of foods and immune responses and inflammation disruption of the gut microbiota might then contribute to a variety of conditions including childhood asthma obesity colitis and colon cancer. Gut feeling: How your microbiota affects your mood sleep and stress levels New research is beginning to show that the composition and activity of the microbiota exhibits a daily or circadian rhythmicity just like we do. This offers one pathway to explain a Pandora?s box of possible adverse health effects from aspects of modern life such as eating late at night or too much electric light after sunset. The microbial daily routine The microbiota is primarily bacterial but also includes viruses and eukaryotes like yeast the latter are much bigger and more complicated than bacteria and have a structure similar to our own cells. The total DNA complement of the microbiota is termed the microbiome and it?s what we study to learn about the inner workings of the microbiota. In this field?s early days researchers took fecal samples from people to investigate the composition of the gut microbiome. Later they noticed that defining the microbiome from a sample taken in the morning was quite different from one taken in the evening: The gut microbiota was not static over the span of the day. Perhaps this was to be expected. Almost all life on Earth has an endogenous circadian rhythmicity that is genetically determined but that also responds to changes in light and dark. For human beings reliable changes occur between day and night in hunger body temperature sleep propensity hormone production activity level metabolic rate and more. These findings on daily rhythmicity in microbiota have really piqued my interest because disruption of our circadian rhythmicity by electric light at night has been my research passion for several decades.  As scientists investigate the links between our internal daily patterns electric light and health new information about the rhythmicity of our microbiome might hold clues about how this all works together. The crucial question is whether the microbes simply respond to their host human?s circadian rhythm or whether they can actually alter our rhythm somehow. And does this really matter anyway? Microbiota calling the shots A group of researchers from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have now used an array of remarkable DNA technologies to show that the gut microbiota changes location within the gut and changes its metabolic outputs over the span of the   day at least in mice.  Amino acids lipids and vitamins that the microbes release circulate in the host mouse?s blood. As the levels of these molecules in the blood changed throughout the day they altered the expression of genes in the mouse?s liver that code for many metabolic enzymes. What do the bacteria living in your gut have to do with your immune system? This is the first clear demonstration of the gut microbiota changing the circadian activity of an essential organ    in this case the liver which is the engine of our physiology and crucial to our health. The authors showed this link by administering an antibiotic to mice that kills much of the gut microbiota. Afterward they found significant changes in liver physiology. They could produce the same effect just by changing the feeding times of the mice mice forced to eat only during the day showed different patterns of microbiota metabolites circulating in the blood than those allowed to eat at night their natural active period. In addition the authors showed the liver changes how it responds to an overdose of acetaminophen over the span of the day in response to signals from the microbiota in the gut. They used acetaminophen as an example of a drug that could damage the liver depending on how it?s broken down. Interestingly an overdose was less toxic at the beginning of the day dawn and most toxic at the end of the day dusk. They concluded that the microbiota regulates how effectively the liver can detoxify over the course of the day. The authors argue that this finding can be extrapolated to apply to metabolism of drugs in general including chemotherapeutic agents we use to treat disease. If so then the time of day that a medication is administered could have a big impact on its effectiveness and on the severity of its adverse side effects. This work has exciting implications. Understanding how time of day matters might allow for better treatment of disease and for prevention of maladies like obesity metabolic syndrome and perhaps other serious conditions. Technology drives the science The findings described by the Weizmann group were made possible by advances in the technology of DNA research. As so often happens scientific insights follow on technological development. This is particularly true in the science of DNA. In order to count trillions of microbes as well as distinguish among hundreds of different species there are four broad requirements: conceptual development sequencing machines analytic approaches and supercomputers to conduct the near hopelessly complex statistical analyses.  Each of these has advanced to an extent that now studies like the one from the Weizmann Institute are achievable. Microbes: Our tiny crucial allies The key conceptual breakthrough in analyzing the microbiome came with the recognition that the complex array of so many different organisms living together in a community may not be reducible.  In other words it doesn?t appear possible to separate out only one bacterial species from the group and understand how it functions in isolation. The community works as a whole.  For example some of its members are bacteria that cannot absorb iron which is necessary for growth. They require   molecules made by other members of the community to survive. So you can?t grow this guy in a Petri dish by itself. Gut and rhythm The findings of the new study from Israel which extends previous exciting work in this area are relevant to humans for many reasons.  For example people who must take antibiotics for extended periods or shift workers who eat at the ?wrong? time of day may be at risk via these microbiome pathways.  In both instances there will be changes in their metabolism that could lead perhaps to higher risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome both of which have been shown to be in excess in night workers. A root cause of these human health issues we see on the macro scale may be our gut microbiota and whether or not it is happy.
234,50397,Pilot passed out in cockpit police say he was drunk,CNN,Donie O'Sullivan,1/2/2017,2017,1,,London (CNN) A pilot who allegedly passed out in the cockpit of a Boeing 737 in Canada was arrested on suspicion of being drunk police said. Capt. Miroslav Gronych was ?behaving oddly before he became unconscious in the cockpit? on Saturday Calgary police said. The plane with 99 passengers and six crew members was scheduled to fly to Regina before heading to Winnipeg and Cancun Mexico. Gronych a    Slovak national in Canada on a work visa was charged with having control of an aircraft while impaired. ?Initial tests conducted by police indicate the pilot was severely impaired by alcohol? police said in a statement. Two hours after his arrest the pilot?s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit of . 08 Calgary police spokesman Staff Sgt. Paul Stacey said according to CNN partner CBC News. ?It had all the potential for a disaster but I?ll tell you this much    the likelihood of a pilot on a major airline like this actually being able to take off when they?re impaired like that is pretty slim because there?s a lot of checks and balances? Stacey said. ?There?s the other flight crew and there?s gate crew and they?re all about safety.? The gate crew noticed Gronych acting strangely and told the   who found Gronych passed out in the pilot?s seat Stacey said. Budget airline Sunwing apologized for their pilot?s behavior and commended the rest of the crew for their diligence in handling what they described as a ?very unfortunate matter.? Sunwing said the plane took off a short time later with a different pilot. Stacey said Transport Canada will investigate and more charges could apply. ?He won?t be flying anytime soon.?
235,50398,Study: Stores recommend sports supplements to teens,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) More than   of sales attendants in vitamin stores nationwide recommended using a popular sports supplement to a caller who claimed to be a teen athlete going against expert medical opinion according to a study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics.  The supplement in question was creatine a favorite of weight lifters typically purchased in flavored powders and mixed with liquids. Because this naturally occurring compound is involved in the body?s energy production many athletes believe it helps them develop muscles faster. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Sports Medicine recommend (PDF) that those younger than 18 do not use creatine. ?It has been estimated that perhaps upwards of 30% of high school athletes are using Creatine? said Dr. Ruth Milanaik lead author of the study and a pediatrician at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children?s Medical Center of New York.  ?In addition the majority of teens using Creatine reported that they ?did not read the package insert? and either ?didn?t know the dose? they were taking or were purposely ?taking more in order to get quicker results? ? Milanaik wrote in an email.  Recommended by   of stores Anecdotal evidence suggests that creatine may impair liver and kidney function and cause muscle cramps according to the authors.  Creatine use may also increase the risk of ?compartment syndrome? in which pressure builds in a muscle and prevents blood flow. Finally the authors warn that dietary workout supplements such as creatine are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. ?Dietary supplements are regulated by the FDA    albeit not in the same way as pharmaceutical drugs for example? said Lyndsay Meyer spokeswoman for the agency. The set of regulations which guide the FDA?s oversight of supplements are different from those covering ?conventional? foods and drug products said Meyer. Still the authors claim that some supplements are adulterated in some cases with pharmaceutical drugs which might lead to adverse effects. ?A young teen patient of mine had serious medical side effects? Milanaik said. ?After going over his medical record on a whim I asked about herbal supplements. He informed me that he was taking Creatine that had been recommended by his local vitamin store to help him ?prepare for the upcoming football season.? ?  Her patient ended up in a hospital diagnosed with dehydration and other issues. Milanaik with the help of    Princeton student researcher Maguire Herriman decided to look at ?whether this was an isolated issue or whether this was widespread.? Were other local vitamin stores routinely recommending   supplements to unsuspecting teens? Posing as a    high school athlete seeking to increase his muscle strength Herriman called 244 health food stores across the United States and asked the sales attendant what supplements he or she would recommend.  If a sales attendant did not mention creatine or testosterone boosters initially Herriman would specifically ask about them. He also asked whether a    could purchase these products in the store on his own.  ?No sales person was coerced into recommendations? Milanaik said. ?If a salesperson was willing to answer to our questions it can be assumed that   would give similar answers to actual teen customers.? Sales attendants at 164 stores (about 67% of the 244) recommended creatine. Of these about 38% recommended creatine without prompting and nearly 29% recommended creatine after being asked specifically about it.  Nearly 10% of sales attendants recommended a testosterone booster to the caller though medical experts believe this too could be harmful for teens. Although it is not illegal to sell these products to teens many have labels that say they are recommended only for adults.  ?Not only did we find that health food stores were making recommendations contrary to medical opinion we found that they were actually ignoring age restriction warning labels on the product packages? Milanaik said. She and her   found that just over 74% of sales attendants stated a    was allowed to purchase creatine while slightly more than 41% said the   teen could purchase a testosterone booster.  An individual matter Richard Kraus owner of Health Unlimited a health and natural supplements store based in Atlanta says he has never encountered this issue with his own customers. ?I talk to a handful of people with athletic teenagers but that?s never come up for that age group? Kraus said. He added that in general older teens     over the age of 17    are more likely to purchase supplements or ask for advice. When that happens his sales associates steer them to Kraus since he is more knowledgeable.  ?I?ve read things and talked to different trainers? Kraus said. He?s been in the business for many years but admits ?I?m not a scientist not a doctor so I haven?t studied it in a lab or reviewed a lot of studies.?  Still the creatine products on his shelves are sourced from ?reputable companies? he said with labels cautioning ?for adults only? or ?consult your health care professional before using.? Kraus said he probably wouldn?t recommend the product to anyone under the age of 17 who wasn?t seriously into athletics.  ?In general a    would be too young to benefit from it? he said adding that teens that age should concentrate on eating a really good diet instead. Still Kraus sees supplementation as an individual matter since some teens are more developed than others and some ?demand much more of their bodies and need different things to replenish themselves? compared with the average person Kraus said. ?It?s not    .? ?Deception is necessary? Though the study results serve as an important warning for parents some might question the ethics of researchers constructing an elaborate ruse in order to gather information. ?Deception in research should be minimized whenever possible? Milanaik said. ?However there are circumstances where deception is necessary and we believe this is one of them.? She added that she and her colleagues considered an alternative method of a   survey of young teens but decided such a survey would not achieve the objective of ?focusing on the quality of information provided by employees in stores specializing in sales of vitamins and supplements.? Dr. Robert Glatter an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital NYC said that using an undercover approach to investigate selling supplements to minors is ?certainly justified.? Glatter had no involvement in the research. ?It only makes sense that this would be a rational and logical way to approach such an inquiry.? He added that he could ?attest to the dangers of creatine as well as testosterone? because while working in the ER he has taken care of teens who have developed kidney and liver problems as a result of using such products. The American Academy of Pediatrics which published the study agreed that no matter its methods the research was worthwhile. The journal Pediatrics ?publishes studies that are relevant to improving the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. Every manuscript goes through   and an editorial board discussion prior to making a decision as to whether or not to publish.  The same process was followed for this study? the academy wrote in an email. The study raises important issues for many people Milanaik said. Health food stores might want to raise awareness among employees about   products so they can redirect teens to healthy diets she said.   Meanwhile pediatricians might raise awareness of this issue both among themselves and among parents. Milanaik said she and her   hope their article will help physicians ?guide teens in making more educated choices about their health.?   Finally both parents and teens might want to ?look at product labels before taking supplements and talk to their physicians if they have questions? Milanaik said. ?It should not be assumed that all products in a health food store are ?healthy? for all consumers.?

237,50401, New Year?s resolution: Hold Russia accountable,CNN,,12/30/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) It may not have been the dominant headline but make no mistake    2016 was the year when mass atrocities against children became the new normal. Without a doubt history offers up a multitude of moments when children?s rights have been systematically violated in the course of war. From the scorched earth of Stalingrad during the Second World War to Srebrenica during the Bosnian conflict time and again children have been thrust onto the front lines of conflict. But during 2016 a year that was a total war on normalcy the abuse of children?s rights was pushed to new extremes. From Syria to South Sudan from Nigeria to Nepal abuses have become so commonplace    and the world?s response so anemic    that the perpetrators of these atrocities have carried out their violent acts with impunity.  Our new year?s resolution for 2017 must be to bring the perpetrators of these crimes against children to justice and then go a step further and show that never again will the world stand by as the rights of boys and girls are violated. Let us start by naming and confronting the reality that many violations in the Syrian conflict are borne out of military action taken by state actors. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and it has ratified the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Claims alleging human rights violations by ECHR Contracting States can be brought before the European Court of Human Rights. Given the evidence of Russia?s involvement in perpetrating atrocities in Syria Syrian families have a forum in which they can seek accountability and justice for the wrongs they have suffered. In practical legal terms a claim before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) regarding Russia?s involvement in the Syrian conflict is one of only a few routes open to those seeking some semblance of    accountability. Last week the UN General Assembly voted to establish an investigative body to ?collect consolidate preserve and analyze evidence? and to prepare cases on war crimes. But this initiative may be more symbolic than substantive since we know that no matter the evidence no case on the Syrian conflict is likely to ever reach the International Criminal Court (ICC) as neither Russia nor Syria are members. And as long as Russia vetoes the only other route    a referral to the ICC by the Security Council    we can be certain that the victims of the Syrian killing fields will never find justice through such legal recourse. But we?ve been here before. In 2011 the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was established by the   UN Human Rights Council to investigate possible war crimes. At its inception the Commission called unsuccessfully for the Syrian authorities to immediately put an end to all human rights violations to fully comply with their obligations under international human rights law and heed calls for an immediate end to all violence in Syria. The Commission is now armed with a list of war crimes suspects. But while it has produced four excellent reports plus four periodic updates exposing human rights violations in Syria based on interviews with over 1 400 witnesses and victims prosecutions have never ensued. The Syrian government has prevented the Commission from undertaking investigations inside the country. And while the Commission?s concern was extended to include investigations of all massacres the Security Council could not agree on the Commission?s proposal to refer the Syrian case to the ICC. So even after the Commission?s next report to the   Council in February we may still be at square one. If international humanitarian law has been found wanting it is no time to forget the power of international human rights law which has been built up over decades and which is reflected in the    European Convention of Human Rights. Its protections do not cease to apply in situations of armed conflict and where there is an available forum such as the European Court of Human Rights it should be used to bring the cases of Syrian children who have been victims of recent attacks.  The Idlib school bombing of Oct. 26 which tragically left at least 35 children and teachers dead would make for a strong test case. Most children died as they rushed for safety from the kindergarten elementary school two middle schools and secondary school that were part of a single education complex. But the targeting of the schools was no accident: at least six bombs were dropped despite the fact there were no military targets nearby. In the immediate aftermath of the bombing Russia said it would support an inquiry. Attempts to persuade the Security Council to call Russia?s bluff failed. And when Tony Lake the Executive Director of UNICEF alleged that a war crime had been committed and there were calls for the Security Council to intervene Russia claimed there had been no bombing at all. In the face of growing evidence of the use of   aircraft in the strikes    the planes typically flown by Syrian and Russian air force pilots    Russia has now taken a third line. They have issued a denial that Russian or Syrian warplanes dropped any bombs in Idlib at any time from October 17 to October 26 of this year. The ECHR can test Russia?s claims. This can be brought to trial if a Syrian family affected by the violence brings a case to the European Court. Of course Russia may claim that before any action is taken in the ECHR domestic courts must first adjudicate the matter. But by the same logic of strategic   that has led Russia to intervene in a foreign conflict there is a good argument to be made for the ECHR to intervene on behalf of Syrian families highly unlikely to find justice in a Potemkin court. If the bottomless   of war crimes witnessed against children in 2016 has taught us anything it is that we must ensure humanity?s common conscience is not just enshrined in our laws but practically enforced when those very laws are broken. At the outset of the New Year we should resolve that when schools become military targets we will not stand aside. When violations against children are brought to our attention we will not just wring our hands. When children become weapons of war we will not stay silent.  Only when we send a clear message of hope    that we are prepared to defend children?s rights at all costs    will millions of children begin to feel safe.

239,50404,Parent obesity may affect child development study says,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Being overweight may impact not only your health but your future child?s development as well a new study suggests.  Children of obese parents may be at risk for developmental delays says the study published in the journal Pediatrics.  In the United States an estimated one in five women is obese when they get pregnant registering a body mass index above 30. The healthy average is between 18. 5 and 24. 9.  But few studies have looked at the father?s weight even though 20% to 30% of US adults    both male and female    are obese. A team from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development set out to learn more. ?Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers and our results suggest that dad?s weight also has significant influence on child development? said lead researcher Dr. Edwina Yeung an investigator at the institute. Effects differ based on the heavier parent The researchers looked at 4 821 children from 4 months old to the age of 3 between 2008 and 2010 and found specific effects on children depending on which parent is obese. Compared with normal or underweight mothers children of obese mothers were more likely to have difficulty using small muscles such as those in their fingers or hands.  Paternal obesity was associated with increased risk of failing at   activities such as feeding themselves playing and undressing themselves. Those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail   tests. Pinpointing progress The researchers used data from the ongoing Upstate KIDS study which follows over 6 000 children born in New York state.  It aims to track the growth motor and social development of children and its correlation with infertility treatments obesity rising maternal age and pregnancy complications.  Parents are asked to regularly complete the Ages and Stages Questionnaire for their children. ?The questionnaire is a screening tool. It?s an indicator of whether a child is on track for behaviors appropriate to his or her age? Yeung explained. The tool was designed to pinpoint development progress and catch delays in children up to the age of 6. Yeung?s team looked at reports recorded by parents at 4 8 12 18 24 30 and 36 months. According to Yeung although parents are   information the potential for bias is small as questions are straightforward (PDF). ?The fine motor skills part for example asks such questions as whether the child can turn the pages of a book or whether he or she can stack blocks? she explained. Mothers also completed a questionnaire about health status and lifestyle at enrollment to determine both parents? height and weight before pregnancy. According to the study authors factors associated with obesity    such as lower income and education smoking and alcohol use    were taken into to consideration when analyzing the results.  Weight at delivery was taken from electronic birth certificates.  Cause remains unclear It is not unclear exactly why parental obesity might increase developmental delays in children. ?Our study wasn?t designed to prove cause and effect. At this point we only have correlations between parents? BMI and children?s scores on a screening questionnaire? Yeung stressed. However the authors note that studies on animals show that obesity during pregnancy may promote inflammation which can affect the fetal brain.  ?Obesity is correlated with a rise in inflammation and in hormones that regulate body fat and metabolism. One theory is that these hormones might influence the development of the baby?s brain? Yeung said. Other theories are that high blood sugar or a shortage of certain nutrients might influence brain development. The study offers less information on the potential effects of paternal obesity on child development but the authors cite previous research hypothesizing that obesity could affect the expression of genes in sperm. Scott Johnson a professor in developmental psychology at the University of California Los Angeles was fascinated by team?s results.   ?The authors pose some interesting possible mechanisms by which maternal and paternal obesity could be responsible for the outcomes they reported? Johnson said. He thinks the theories that maternal obesity poses a risk to a fetus? development are sound but says much more research is required. ?It wasn?t clear to me how that general property induces specific deficits in fine motor skills? Johnson said. The effects of obesity in male sperm are also not sufficiently explained but the developmental psychology expert says it is not impossible. ?It?s not a crazy idea. It has been speculated for some time that there may be distinct paternal genetic contributions to autism risk for example? he said. What?s next? ?Overall the study has some important findings and an intriguing set of possible explanations? Johnson concluded.  However at this point nothing can be confirmed.  ?It?s really important to stress that these results need to be confirmed by other studies? Yeung agreed. But that is not easy as recruiting families and collecting and analyzing the data could take years. If the team?s results are confirmed physicians who work with young children might take parents? weight into account when screening for development. In the end it?s one more reason to keep an eye on your waistline.  ?We know that obesity greatly increases the risk for such conditions as heart disease diabetes and stroke. For anyone male or female pregnant or not it makes sense to attain a healthy weight? Yeung said.
240,50406,Andy Murray knighted in New Year?s Honors,CNN,,12/31/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) A monumental year for Andy Murray just got even bigger    the tennis world No. 1 has been knighted in Britain?s 2017 New Year?s Honors List. The traditional list overseen by the UK government recognizes the achievements and service of ?extraordinary? people and 2016 certainly has been an extraordinary year for Murray. The    ended the season as world No. 1 for the first time toppling Novak Djokovic    who had held the top spot since July 2014. Murray had a golden summer winning his second Wimbledon title in July and then claiming his second Olympic gold at the Rio Games in August. Last but not least Murray and his wife Kim also became parents with the birth of daughter Sophia in February just days after he played in the Australian Open final. CNN?s Open Court presenter Pat Cash says there is more to come from ?Sir Andy Murray? in 2017: ?One of my predictions is that he will be No. 1 for quite a while next year. He?ll be pushed but for the majority of the year he will be No. 1. Have your say on our Facebook page ?I also think he?ll win the French Open. He?s desperate to win that one and I think he?ll grab it.? It was not quite the start to 2017 that Murray wanted when he lost his first match  (4)   to Belgian David Goffin at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi Friday. Another multiple Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah also received a knighthood after defending his   and 10 000m track titles in Rio.  The distance runner who came to the UK from Somalia at the age of eight was forced to deny doping allegations in 2015 after it emerged he missed two drugs tests in the buildup to London 2012. Jessica Ennis who added heptathlon silver to London gold in Rio before retiring was made a dame (the highest accolade for women) along with Olympic rowing gold medalist Katherine Grainger.

241,50407,South Korea scandal: Choi Soon-sil?s daughter arrested in Denmark,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) The daughter of the woman at the center of South Korea?s presidential corruption scandal has been arrested in Denmark after months in hiding according to special prosecutors. An arrest warrant was issued for Chung      daughter of Choi      in December for alleged interference of business. Choi was a friend and informal adviser to South Korean President Park   and has been described as a   character to the leader. Chung was taken into custody Sunday night in the northern Danish city of Aalborg by North Jutland Police and appeared in court Monday. She was remanded in custody for four weeks. Danish authorities said they have asked the South Korean Ministry of Justice to send a formal extradition request. At a press conference on December 21 Lee   a spokesman for South Korea?s special counsel team told media that Chung    a   equestrian    was suspected to be in Germany. ?South Korean prosecutors plan to seek cooperation with German prosecutors on her arrest and freezing assets belonged to both Choi and Chung in Germany? he said at the time.  RELATED: South Korea scandal    What you need to know Special treatment Chung 20 is a   figure in South Korea. She won gold as a member of the group dressage equestrian event at the 2014 Asian Games. She?s also attracted public attention due to her family?s high profile and suggestions that she?s used their connections to her advantage. Last year Chung was accused of receiving special treatment to secure admission to Ewha Woman?s University a top school in Seoul. After the scandal emerged the university canceled Chung?s admission and expelled her.  The head of the university also resigned. Chung is also reported to have received 2. 8 million euros from Samsung.  During a parliamentary hearing in early December Samsung?s J. Y Lee admitted the company had provided Choi?s daughter with a horse and apologized. He said he didn?t recall how much Samsung had provided to Choi and Chung in total.

State Rep. Armando ?Mando? Martinez   said his wife had just given him a kiss shortly after ringing in the new year with family and friends and the next thing he knew ?it felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head.? A bullet fragment had just punctured the top of the south Texas legislator?s head. Martinez said he had just stepped outside a home in a rural neighborhood north of Weslaco when he was hit. Martinez 40 was transferred to the neurosurgical unit at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen where surgeons removed the bullet fragment. The fragment had penetrated his skull and lodged itself into the dura mater the top layer of the brain doctors told Martinez.  The fragment appears to be from a . 223 caliber round said Martinez who spoke to CNN by phone on Sunday while recovering at the hospital.   ?Had it gone any further I don?t think we would be having this conversation? Martinez said.  Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said Martinez?s survival was nothing short of a miracle. The sheriff?s office is investigating the shooting and investigators ?have reason to believe that (Martinez) was hit by a stray bullet? county sheriff?s office spokesman JP Rodriguez said. ?There is no evidence to indicate he was targeted? Rodriguez said. ?It was a miracle last night. I was given another chance at life and I?m grateful for it? Martinez said.  Martinez was elected to a seventh term in November and scheduled to take the oath of office January 10.
243,50409,The bleak depressing reality for young Arabs,CNN,Nic Robertson,12/30/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) Who remembers Mohamed Bouazizi? The answer maybe is not many of us. Perhaps we can be forgiven. So much has happened in the past six years so much has changed. But if you happen to be a young Arab as Bouazizi was living in the Middle East not all of that change has been for good. Mohamed Bouazizi was the Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire after an argument with a policeman late in 2010. He was crushed in the outfall of the 2008 economic crash. His death spread flames across the Middle East in what was to become known as the Arab Spring. Related: The man who set off revolutions A bold and troubling UN report on Human Development in the Arab world warns the kindling that fueled the Arab Spring is drier than ever. To be a young Arab in the Middle East today is to be more disadvantaged and more vulnerable to violence than any other time in recent history. Between 2000 and 2003 there were four conflicts in the Middle East according to the report. That number has grown to 11 between 2010 and 2015 and by the end of the decade the report concludes three out of four countries in the region could be ?vulnerable to conflict.?  Arabs are exposed to violence and upheaval in a way that no other large   group is. Though the Arab region contains just 5% of the world?s population it has 17% of the global conflicts 45% of all terrorist attacks and 57. 5% of the worldwide total of displaced people. The statistics on violence become even more worrying when the economic woes and an   population are put in the picture. At least 30% of Arabs are aged 15 to 29 years old    that?s 105 million people. Sixty percent of the population is under 30. While the Human Development Index (HDI) in the three decades prior to Bouazizi?s   showed improvements in education and health care the economy fell behind triggering an overall downturn. Experts use the HDI to measure ?human ? a function of long healthy lives being well educated and having a decent standard of living. For young Arabs in the Middle East HDI growth in the five years after 2010 is half what it was in the previous decade and markedly below the world average. The backdrop to these numbers is gloomy. The instability and political uncertainty make it difficult to look to country leaders for direction and job creation to employ their growing populations. Unemployment in 2014 was two times the global average    almost 30% of Arab young people versus a 13. 99% average in the rest of the world. And as poor economic prospects often provide a pathway toward radicalism that alone is deeply troubling.  And consider this    In the past few months a boatload of migrants believed to be from Libya sank in the Mediterranean with the loss of dozens of lives. It was later found many were Egyptian youths hoping to find a better life in Europe perhaps hoping to send money home to struggling relatives. Egypt is a case in point. A population of close to 100 million a tanking economy rising prices and a leadership struggling to lift the country out of the downward spiral the youth showed they had the resilience to take on the regime in protests from  . The UN report estimates young Arabs are twice as likely as   countries? youths to take to the streets in protest. It says that 68% of Arab youths versus 87% of young people in other   countries are likely to vote    a differential that speaks volumes about their confidence in democracy and their ability to shape it. The assessment by the UN in its   report is that across the Middle East approximately 60 million new jobs will be needed by 2020 to even begin to meet needs never mind expectations. The implications are clear. Unless the leaders of some of the most populous countries in the Middle East rise to the challenge and create jobs    and therefore hope    for their booming young populations there will be more strife ahead and that trouble    unlike the early days of the Arab Spring    may not stay at home.
244,50410,Chicago?s 762 homicides in 2016 is highest in 19 years,CNN,Azadeh Ansari,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Chicago marked 2016 as the deadliest year in nearly two decades data released by the Chicago Police Department shows.  The city saw a surge in gun violence in 2016: 762 murders 3 550 shooting incidents and 4 331 shooting victims according to a statement released by the department on Sunday.   There were 480 murders in 2015 the most in the city since 1997. The bloodshed has brought trauma to the lives of thousands of people. City police investigated 27 shooting incidents 12 of which were fatal just in the last week of December 2016.  Attacks on police officers nearly doubled in 2016 which represents a ?completely unacceptable rise in violence? the release said. However it did not state specific figures for attacks on officers.  As part of plan to combat the rising homicide count the Chicago Police Department will amp up its force in 2017.  In August Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner passed a gun control law that imposes stiffer penalties on anyone without a   identification card who brings a gun into the state intending to sell it. Not all figures were negative. City officers made 10% more gun arrests in 2016 and confiscated 8 300 guns a 20% increase from 2015 the release said.  
245,50411,The new face of Mother Emanuel,CNN,Darran Simon,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Charleston South Carolina (CNN) The young pastor stood in a house filled with mourners ready to minister. His parishioner had been strangled her body dumped. The Rev. Eric S. C. Manning prayed with the victim?s devastated mother reciting from Psalms one of his favorite books in the Bible: ?I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help.? Days later Manning led the funeral for the young woman.  It was his first eulogy for a murder victim. ?Standing there delivering the eulogy was hard but God brought me through that? he said recalling that emotional moment 14 years ago. Over the years Manning has dealt with tragedy and death including in his own family.  And the prayers and comfort he knows how to give to people who have lost a loved one in a sudden savage way prepared him for what is one of the toughest recent pastor assignments in America: being the spiritual leader of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston South Carolina where white supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine members including the church?s beloved pastor during a Bible study in June 2015. ?God through every aspect every juncture of my life was preparing me for this time? said Manning 49 who was handpicked to shepherd a traumatized congregation that he admits he?s still figuring out how to lead. ?No one?s ever seen this before.? Gifts and graces for the situation Manning is a dignified man who often wears one of the 30 to 40 bow ties he owns. He wore his clergy robe when he sat in a Charleston courtroom last month providing what he called ?a ministry of presence.? Armed with his Bible he listened as family members of victims and survivors gave graphic emotional testimony during Roof?s federal trial. Sometimes Manning placed his hand on a shoulder or gave a hug. ?He has all of the gifts and graces that a situation like that could call for? said the Rev. Wendell Christopher Sr. who knows Manning and once led the Maryland church where the parishioner was strangled in 2002. ?They couldn?t have appointed a better man a better pastor than Rev. Manning.? A jury swiftly convicted Roof on all counts. On Tuesday the jury will decide his sentence. Some family members of victims appear torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Manning who is against the death penalty said the trial drained him. But he plans to be back in court Bible in tow on Tuesday for phase two. Summoned to a traumatized church Roof targeted the historically black church often called Mother Emanuel on June 17 2015 because he wanted to start a race war he told the FBI. He showed up at the Bible study where the group welcomed him and handed him a sheet of verses. He sat with the victims for about 15 minutes and then when they stood for prayers pulled out a Glock .  pistol and fired 70 rounds at them. Last June a few days after the anniversary of the massacre Manning was working in his office at Bethel AME in Georgetown South Carolina when his phone rang. It was Bishop Richard Franklin Norris leader of the 7th Episcopal District that includes the scores of AME churches in South Carolina. ?I need you to go to Mother Emanuel? Manning recalled Norris saying. Manning took a step back and sat in a chair. Humbled by the request he called his wife. ?I told him to follow his heart? Andretta Manning 47 said. In June 2016 Manning became Emanuel?s new leader replacing a pastor who had been reassigned after six months at the church following the Roof shootings. ?God will continue to guide me? Word soon spread across South Carolina that Manning was Emanuel?s new pastor. Mark Ross a professor of theology at Erskine Theological Seminary?s Columbia South Carolina campus where Manning had earned his master of divinity degree in 2011 sent his former prized pupil an email offering prayers. ?He?s one of those students in your class that you?re expecting great things will come of him? Ross recalled.    In the email exchange that Ross shared with CNN Manning thanked his former professor for ?being such a great inspiration? and wrote that in retrospect he could see ?that the Lord was preparing me for such an awesome task (I never thought that it would be something such as this).? ?God will continue to guide me? he wrote. Manning had led four AME churches in South Carolina over a dozen years before his appointment to Emanuel. At each church he learned the names of his parishioners so he could address them personally when he prayed for them.  ?My husband is the type of person that wherever he?s assigned that?s where his heart is with the people? his wife said. At Emanuel Manning said he reached out to the families of the victims and the survivors to get to know them. ?We talked we cried. . .. We laughed? he said. Clifford Jones a lifelong Emanuel member whose cousin Ethel Lance 70 died in the shooting said he has been impressed with Manning?s devotion to the families and survivors who have suffered. ?We had those trials the last couple of weeks and he was there every day for the families? said Jones 56 a disabled Army veteran living in North Charleston South Carolina. ?That just shows he?s dedicated and he?s passionate and he cares.?  Finding his call Manning?s path to ministry started to form early though he didn?t realize it at the time. Manning recalled that a career placement questionnaire he filled out while in high school in the Philadelphia suburbs listed his possible career paths as the military law and religion. The military came first. Manning spent six years in active duty in the Army in his late teens and early 20s rising to the rank of sergeant. He laid eyes on his future wife when they were both stationed in South Korea. Andretta Manning came from a military family of eight siblings. The couple married six months later on January 25 1991. The Mannings later moved to Florence South Carolina where Manning?s mother had relocated. She soon left her church but Manning stayed and he set out on his path to the ministry. His initial sermon in 1995 touched on walking in the spirit and not the flesh. He was ordained two years later.  ?Looking back at it I responded in the due season that God would have me respond? Manning said. Prepared for ?difficult times? By the late 1990s the Mannings were parents of two young children. He moved the family to Maryland for a job in information technology a career that was helping pay the bills while he also served as a pastor. The family later joined Mt. Moriah AME Church in Annapolis where he became the associate pastor. Manning would deal with several difficult deaths in his family. In one instance his    had beaten cancer in his lungs but the disease then attacked his brain. Manning drove his wife back and forth on trips from Maryland to Rhode Island to care for her father. He ministered to her and her siblings and eulogized his    at his funeral. Manning?s wife said the experience ?prepared him for the difficult times . .. having to be there for people that are close to you.? His readiness to deal with a violent death was tested in September 2002 when his parishioner was violently killed. ?It was a murder it was something I?d never dealt with. I never thought we would have to deal with? he said of the death of Paula Lynne Edwards the parishioner. ?But we did.?  Forgiveness brings peace Edwards 34 was a mother of three girls and a school bus driver. Police found her body on September 7 2002 said her mother Betty J. Edwards 79 a retired teacher. She recalled that Manning visited the family the next day after church service. He told her ?God will give you the strength that you need.? Edwards of Severna Park Maryland said Manning: ?just consoled me in what he said.? Paula Edwards? oldest daughter Monica Alexander also remembers Manning?s consoling advice. ?You?re not going to forget but when you are ready in your life you?ll have to find some type of forgiveness so that you can have peace? Alexander 29 of Glen Burnie Maryland recalled him saying. Her father was sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing her mother.   ?I am here to serve you? In the days leading up to his arrival at Emanuel Manning prayed and fasted. He declined interviews he said because he wanted the congregation to learn about its new pastor in person not through media reports. He hoped to show parishioners he believed he was ?a pastor after God?s own heart? he said. He settled on scriptures from Psalms for his first sermon including the familiar ?The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.? He told his congregation ?he didn?t know how to lead them? he recalled but he would lean on God?s guidance. After the sermon he said one member told him ?We?re going to take care of you while you?re here.? He responded: ?No I am here to serve you.? Bearing a heavy load Emanuel now draws a steady stream of visitors who know what happened there. Some come to worship some come out of macabre curiosity.  ?If they come to be a spectator who knows they might leave a worshiper? Manning said.  ?If they come . .. out of curiosity they may leave having a deeper understanding of God?s love and grace.? Manning believes that grace was visible as he and the families of the victims endured the trial last month. In one of the most chilling moments of the roughly weeklong proceeding they watched a police video of Roof laughing after confessing to the shootings. Like everyone Manning felt the heavy weight of the trial. One night he asked his wife ?How much more do you think I can handle?? He knows the congregation?s healing continues    and that they will heal together. In his sermons he often refers to the congregation as one: ?We are Mother Emanuel.? ?We are a body of believers who have gone through a tragedy the world has watched us? he said. ?We will continue to have resilience. . .. We will continue to believe that God is still in the midst.?

247,50413,The agony of Earth?s hottest year ,CNN,John D. Sutter,12/29/2016,2016,12,,Shishmaref Alaska (CNN) Sick of the cold? Tired of ice? This little Inupiat village    about 30 miles from the Arctic Circle    would gladly take a dose of both.  ?I miss that   weather? said Hazel Fernandez 62. ?It?s too weird. It?s too warm.? Outside Shishmaref Alaska looked like this:  My phone showed the temperature at 24 degrees Fahrenheit ( . 4 Celsius).  But that felt downright steamy to Fernandez and others.  She was wearing sneakers instead of insulated boots or sealskin mittens.  Old timers prefer weather that?s 20 or 30 below.  Globally 2016 is expected to be the hottest on record    breaking the record set in 2015 which broke the record from the year before that. (Breitbart News and others are cherry picking data to tell you otherwise.) In all scientists say humans have warmed the planet about 1 degree Celsius since around the time of the Industrial Revolution. This heat which we?re causing by burning fossil fuels and trapping warmth in the atmosphere is contributing to a host of dangerous weather around the world. A flood this August in Louisiana for example killed 13 people. Scientists say that event was made 40% more likely    and 10% more intense    because of climate change. Perhaps nowhere are the consequences more apparent than here in the Arctic which is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. In   temperatures across the far north were up to 35 degrees Fahrenheit above normal shocking scientists.  On December 22 the North Pole was a stunning 50 degrees above average. The heat comes with dire consequences.  In August this   village voted to relocate because this barrier island is melting. The permafrost is thawing out from beneath homes and huge chunks of the coast are crumbling. To understand the toll this takes visit the tiny blue house at the edge of the land.  There I found Shelton Kokeok 72 sitting at a kitchen table and staring out the window at the Chukchi Sea. The water looked like   slush on December 19.  ?It?s not frozen it?s not frozen? he said sounding distraught. ?You better not take a walk out there. That ice should be solid    thick and solid now. It used to be really cold.?  The slush is a personal affront to Kokeok. Freakishly warm temperatures have melted the ocean and the coastline causing one of his neighbor?s homes to topple off the edge. Most of his other neighbors moved their homes across the island and farther from danger. The sea ice helps protect the island from storms so Kokeok doesn?t feel safe until it?s solid.  It?s been freezing far later and thawing far earlier.  Arctic sea ice tied 2007 for its   extent this year.  On the coffee table in his living room Kokeok keeps a photo of his son Norman. On June 2 2007 he fell through thin ice on a hunting trip and died.  Kokeok blames warming for taking his son?s life.  Elders in the village told me the ice where he was hunting should have been solid then.  Kokeok would rather stay at his perch at the edge of the Earth but residents voted    89 to 78    to get out. It?s unclear when that will happen or how much it will cost said Annie Weyiouanna who is coordinating the move for the local tribe.  In December no one was packing.  There?s been no funding dedicated to relocation Weyiouanna said.  It?s difficult to overstate the significance of that vote. Shishmaref has been here for 400 years and before that the community was nomadic seeking out the best spots along this coast to hunt seal walrus and caribou and to gather orange and red tundra berries. Locals still live off the land. You?ll find seal oil    made from blubber    in most homes. There?s no running water or sewage so locals harvest giant chunks of ice and melt it for drinking water.  It?s a hard life but one rich in culture and meaning.  We?re putting that in jeopardy by using fossil fuels.  We?re also putting ourselves at risk. No matter where we live the consequences of a   climate are here    and will get far far worse if we don?t switch to cleaner forms of energy. Shishmaref may seem far and away but   worse floods failed crops mass extinction and climate refugees will be all of our problem.  Visiting the Arctic is simply a window into the future of climate change if we fail to act. I met Fernandez the woman who misses the ? ? weather in a community hall in Shishmaref on a recent morning in December. Her friend Susie Nayokpuk was wearing a pink   and selling   lottery tickets. She?d rather be ice fishing she said but the sea wasn?t frozen. ?It?s the world changing I guess? she said.  Yes and we are the ones changing it. 
248,50414,Chicago?s homicides: How we got here,CNN,,9/6/2016,2016,9,,Chicago?s 500th homicide of the year happened over Labor Day weekend according to the Chicago Tribune. That number carries a lot of weight for the city    not just in quantity but in meaning: 2016 is now the deadliest year in two decades. CHICAGO VS. OTHER CITIES When you compare Chicago?s homicide rate to that of other big cities in the country    New York and Los Angeles for example     it tops the list. But Chicago is not the homicide capital of the United States. New Orleans St. Louis Detroit Baltimore and Newark all have higher rates when you drill down the data per capita. However this doesn?t tell the entire story of Chicago?s bloodshed. There?s another statistic that points to a disturbing trend the city is facing: a surge. WHAT 500 MEANS In the early 2000s the homicide rate in Chicago held steady but it began an upward tick in 2014 and has been increasing ever since.  But 2016 is the deadliest year in two decades when it comes to homicide rates.  Chicago hit 500 homicides before the end of the summer. In 2015 the city had 480 homicides total. The    breakdown of those figures is alarming. For example there were 12 murders on Father?s Day weekend alone. The youngest victim was just 16. THE GUN PROBLEM A lot of the homicides in Chicago are  . There are nearly 82 shootings per week. In just one weekend in August there were eight   homicides and 64   shootings.  Chicago has strict gun laws which is why many gun rights advocates point to it as evidence that tighter regulation doesn?t equal less crime. But Chicago?s gun violence problem is more complicated. Sixty percent of the guns used in shootings were purchased out of state.  ?We border Indiana and Wisconsin which have really lax gun laws? Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.  ?We know that people from Chicago go across the border fill up gym bags with illegal weapons from gun shows and things of that nature and they come back here and sell them to the gangs.? Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner recently signed a new gun control law that imposes harsher penalties on those who bring in guns from out of state to sell and do not have   ID cards. WHO?S TO BLAME? There?s a deeply rooted distrust of Chicago?s police force.  The city?s police department has been under review for months in the wake of     shootings including that of Laquan McDonald.  An independent task force has accused the police department of institutional racism saying officers ?have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.? However   shootings are only a tiny portion of Chicago?s homicide rate. From January 1 to September 8 there were six deaths tied to   shootings according to the Independent Police Review Authority. Furthermore there have been 13 instances this year in which a Chicago cop fired a weapon and hit an individual.   The other side of this battle is the street crime in Chicago which has led to the killing of innocent bystanders and kept residents shut inside their homes out of fear. Englewood resident Stephanie Armas 43 said she taught her kids from a very young age what to do when they hear gunshots.   ?If you live in a society where (your children) have to learn to duck and dodge bullets you have to teach them how to duck and dodge bullets? Armas said on September 1. ?That?s all you can do.? Some Chicagoans partly blame the violence on economic struggles and lack of jobs. However Chicago?s unemployment rate fell from 6. 1% in 2015 to 5. 5% in 2016. Johnson said police can only do so much. Social problems are the root cause of the violence he said. ?We can?t arrest our way out of this situation? he said. ?That?s just not going to happen.? THE PEOPLE We often point to Chicago?s alarming homicide numbers but the real tragedy in this city are the victims and the families left behind.  They are the ones who face this violence every day the ones who stand over gravestones the ones who?ve lost hundreds of sons daughters brothers sisters mothers and fathers. Here are a few Chicagoans we?ve met during our reporting: Tre Bosley lost his brother Terrell when he was mistakenly shot by a gang member while helping a friend take drums into a church. South Side resident Jahmal Cole in March 2016. Englewood resident Stephanie Armas on what she has to tell her grandchildren some days when the streets are too violent September 2016.  She added: ?All mothers    because we?re all in some type of war zone somewhere    you have to teach (your children) to protect themselves.? Chicago resident Darlene Perkins referring to   shootings in November 2015. Michael Gabb whose grandson was killed near a park just blocks from his home in March 2016. 
249,50415,Computer outage disrupts customs at US airports,CNN,Tony Marco,1/3/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) A computer outage at US airports Monday evening left thousands of inbound international travelers stuck behind customs screening stations for hours on one of the busiest travel days of the year. The US Customs and Border Protection processing systems were back online at all airports later in the night spokesman Daniel Hetlage said    but not before creating long lines of disgruntled holiday travelers. The outage lasted from about 5 to 9 p. m. ET Hetlage said. Airport officials and travelers across the country reported delays ranging from 30 minutes to two hours. CBP officers processed international travelers through ?alternative procedures? while the agency scrambled to get systems back online. ?During the technology disruption CBP had access to national   databases and all travelers were screened according to security standards? Hetlage said. ?At this time there is no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature.?  The outage affected passengers on more than 30 flights into Miami International Airport beginning at 6 p. m. spokeswoman Suzy Trutie said. Even after service resumed the airport said it would take extra time for CBP officers to process. The outage lasted about 90 minutes at   Atlanta International Airport before computers were running again US Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rob Brisley said. Jennifer   was returning from a family vacation in London when she arrived at Salt Lake City International Airport. ?Delta had us all line up after we landed and it took a while before customs was even able to find us a place where we could wait because the airport is so small?   said. ?I would not have had any idea of what was going on if my cousin did not text me.? College student Chinedu Elendu was returning with his brother and sister from a family vacation in Nigeria when the outage held him up for about an hour and a half at San Francisco International Airport.  They had just finished two legs of their journey: a 6.  flight from Nigeria to Frankfurt Germany followed by an 11.  flight to San Francisco he said. ?When we got to the place in customs where you scan your passport my brother and sister scanned theirs and got through fine. Mine did not scan and I had to get in a different line. That was the line that took so long? Elendu said. No announcements were made at the airport explaining the delay he said. He overheard people talking about a nationwide computer problem affecting people with all kinds of passports.   Elendu still had one more leg of his trip as he headed back to Portland Oregon for school.

They originally had plans to build a tower in Dubai but canceled the idea after the global financial crisis. Trump scrapped a December news conference in which he was set to announce his plans to address his conflicts of interests. Trump has said he will make an announcement sometime before the inauguration. Speaking this weekend at    the first billionaire   seemed unfazed by the conflicts. ?It is not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal the business? Trump said. ?It?s actually a very simple situation.?  In his   speech Saturday Trump described in detail his electoral victory providing a    recap of places most expected him to loose. He claimed his wife Melania?s late campaign speech in Pennsylvania helped turn the state in his favor. He told the   crowd he was planning an aggressive beginning to his administration vowing to loosen regulations and end President Barack Obama?s signature health care law. ?Regulations are coming off we?re going to get rid of Obamacare? he said also vowing again to construct a border wall between the United States and Mexico. Trump also provided more detail about his bid to reduce the costs of the new Air Force One. He said that when he met with US military brass following the election they informed him that a new aircraft would cost in the $4 billion range  ?   a price he deemed unacceptable. Trump had made the claim previously though hadn?t identified where the price figures came from. US officials including at the White House have suggested the $4 billion is inflated. During his speech Trump claimed to have cut $1 billion from the price tag for the new presidential aircraft. RELATED: Boeing CEO vows to keep Air Force One costs below $4 billion Trump called the generals who he met with ?beautiful? and alleged they made ?Tom Cruise look like dirt.? Trump praised the members of his    club in attendance who each paid $525 for a ticket to the annual New Years Eve party in the Grand Ballroom. He was less enthusiastic about their guests. ?I don?t really care too much about the guests. I don?t give a s*** about their guests? Trump said. And he repeated his harsh criticism of the media claiming they were in the back of the room. (The press assigned to cover Trump?s movements was not present in the ballroom during Trump?s speech). ?They?re really garbage? Trump said of the press.
251,50417,Russia sanctions announced by White House,CNN,Evan Perez,12/29/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) President Barack Obama took unprecedented steps Thursday to retaliate against alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election prompting vows from Russian authorities that Moscow will respond in kind. The administration described Russia?s involvement as ?Significant Malicious   Activities? and sanctioned four Russian individuals and five Russian entities for what it said was election interference. The administration also ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country and two Russian compounds are being closed. This is the first time the names of Russian officials involved in the hacking have become public on the sanctions list. ?Russia?s cyberactivities were intended to influence the election erode faith in US democratic institutions sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process and undermine confidence in the institutions of the US government? a White House statement said. ?These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.? RELATED: Obama puts Trump on the spot with Russia sanctions According to statements from the White House and the Treasury Department the government has sanctioned nine entities and individuals over their alleged interference in the election: the GRU and the FSB which are two Russian intelligence services four individual officers of the GRU and three companies that provided material support to the GRU?s operations.  The US also separately sanctioned two Russian individuals Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev and Alexey Belan for using   means to allegedly cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information. They?ve long been sought by the FBI. Obama also said in the statement announcing that the diplomats have been ordered to leave the country and that those individuals and their families were given 72 hours to leave the United States. ?These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm US interests in violation of established international norms of behavior? Obama said in the statement.   Donald Trump    who has publicly expressed skepticism that Russia meddled in the election    said Thursday it?s time for the US to ?move on? regarding the hacking. But he added that he would meet with intelligence officials next week to be briefed on the matter. ?It?s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things? Trump said in a statement. ?Nevertheless in the interest of our country and its great people I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation.? A senior Obama administration official acknowledged to reporters Thursday that Trump could reverse the sanctions by executive order but added ?I don?t think it?d make a lot of sense.? The Russian diplomats and the two compounds located in Maryland and New York were engaged in intelligence activities but were not alleged to have been involved in the hacking related to the election White House Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco told reporters. The moves are instead part of the US?s comprehensive reaction to   hacking as well as recent harassment of US personnel in Russia. ?What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds one in New York one in Maryland for intelligence collection purposes? Monaco told CNN?s Jake Tapper on ?The Lead? Thursday. ?And what we are saying today is in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government?s increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow and of course their malicious cyberactivities interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process we are imposing consequences.? Russia?s reaction Russia swiftly responded to the actions Thursday. Russia will respond to any ?hostile steps? that the US may take in response to allegations of hacking during the 2016 election according to the official representative for the ministry.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said similar steps will be taken in response to the expulsions though she did not immediately provide further details. Dmitri Peskov a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters there is ?no alternative to reciprocal measures? adding that Putin is ?in no rush to make a decision.? Russia?s first visible action came later Thursday when Russian authorities ordered the closure of the   School of Moscow a US official briefed on the matter said. The order from the Russian government closes the school which serves children of US British and Canadian embassy personnel to US and foreign nationals. The order also closes access to the US embassy vacation house in Serebryany Bor near Moscow. Soon after the administration?s announcement Russia?s embassy in the UK tweeted that Obama?s actions were ?Cold War deja vu? and described the administration as ?hapless.? Congressional Republicans split with Trump House Speaker Paul Ryan a Republican called the sanctions ?overdue? adding that it is an ?appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia.? ?Russia does not share America?s interests? he said in a statement Thursday. ?In fact it has consistently sought to undermine them sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today?s action by the administration is overdue it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration?s ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.? Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham two of Russia?s fiercest critics in the US Senate called for stronger sanctions against Russia. ?The retaliatory measures announced by the Obama administration today are long overdue. But ultimately they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia? the two said in a joint statement. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement on Thursday reiterating the agency?s confidence that the Russian government was involved in the US hacking. ?This activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a   campaign of   operations directed at the US Government and its citizens? the statement read. ?The US Government can confirm that the Russian government including Russia?s civilian and military intelligence services conducted many of the activities generally described by a number of these security companies.? Months of internal debate The administration?s announcement comes after months of internal debate over how to respond to Russian hacking that US law enforcement and intelligence agencies have watched take place for over a year. The US government announced in October that it was ?confident? that the Russian government orchestrated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations of the Democratic Party to influence the 2016 election. Those hacks resulted in the public release of thousands of stolen emails many of which included damaging revelations about the Democratic Party and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the party?s nominee. The hacking of DNC emails eventually led to the resignation of former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz after emails showed her favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. Earlier this month the CIA announced to a group of senators that the hacks were aimed to help elect Trump as president.
252,50418,Trump to ?repeal a lot? of Obama?s actions on day one top aide says,CNN,Eric Bradner,1/1/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump plans to repeal a raft of President Barack Obama?s executive actions in his first day in office Trump?s incoming White House press secretary said Sunday.  Members of the transition team are meeting this week to discuss what actions the incoming president will undertake on day one a source told CNN Monday.  Sean Spicer Trump?s incoming White House press secretary said on ABC?s ?This Week? that Trump will immediately ?repeal a lot of the regulations and actions that have been taken by this administration over the last eight years that have hampered both economic growth and job creation.?  It was one of two moves Spicer said Trump will make immediately after he takes the oath of office.  He didn?t specify which executive actions Trump will repeal.  However Trump has long been critical of Obama?s moves on immigration energy regulation and foreign policy and could look for ways to undo those and other actions.  Spicer also said Trump will begin reforms intended to ?bring a new brand to Washington? with a restriction on members of his administration becoming lobbyists for a period of five years after they leave Trump?s government. ?It?s very ? Spicer said. ?What we?ve had in the past is people who have looked in the rearview mirror.  This time we?re thinking forward.  If you want to serve in a Trump administration you?re going to serve this country not yourself.? Historically on Inauguration Day presidents have signed executive orders as well as presidential orders presenting the nomination of Cabinet officials.  But some of those executive orders never amount to much. For example on his Inauguration Day President Barack Obama announced a number of executive orders including one mandating the prompt closure of the US prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba. Eight years later the prison remains open.
253,50419,Netanyahu questioned in corruption probe,CNN,Oren Liebermann,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Jerusalem  (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was interrogated Monday night on suspicion of corruption in a criminal investigation authorized by the nation?s attorney general. Netanyahu is suspected of having received benefits from businessmen according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld and Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit. Netanyahu was questioned ?under caution on the suspicions of receiving benefits? said Rosenfeld. The term ?under caution? refers to the questioning of someone suspected of having committed a crime with the warning that anything they say or decline to talk about could be used against them in court proceedings. Police and Mandelblit declined to release any further details of the   questioning.   ?There is nothing? Netanyahu has repeatedly denied the allegations against him saying they are politically motivated. On New Year?s Day the Prime Minister posted on his Facebook page ?Unfortunately you?ll have to be disappointed this time as well like you were disappointed in previous affairs. As usual there will not be anything because there is nothing. Try replacing the Prime Minister at the ballot box    as is customary in a democracy.? Netanyahu was investigated by police amid allegations of fraud and breach of trust in the late 1990s during his first term. He was never indicted. Netanyahu is in his fourth term. He has often had a combative relationship with the media which have speculated for days about when the criminal investigation would officially begin and what it would entail. At a holiday event in late December Netanyahu quipped that ?It?s fun? to spar with Israeli journalists on social media. Yair Lapid a Knesset member who is one of the main political threats to Netanyahu urged caution and a quick investigation. ?If two Prime Ministers in a row fall for corruption it will be very difficult to rehabilitate the public?s trust in government? Lapid said on Facebook referencing Ehud Olmert who served before Netanyahu and is now in prison for corruption. ?At the same time for the benefit of the State of Israel and the people of Israel [the investigation] must be fast.? Investigation ongoing Until now the inquiry was an examination. It did not reach the level of a criminal investigation and Netanyahu was not suspected of having committed a crime. That changed as a police car pulled into his residence on Monday night marking the beginning of the criminal investigation. The inquiry into Netanyahu began in   the attorney general said. But the specific accusation that led to the criminal investigation surfaced three months ago. Police investigators searched for the evidence to support the suspicion and last month found the evidence to warrant an investigation. Mandelblit would not elaborate on what the suspected crime was instead ruling out  any link to investigations that have since been dismissed. Those include two issues related to the 2009 elections and primaries and two issues related to receiving flights and benefits overseas. Netanyahu does not have to step down if he is suspected of committing a crime. He is only required to step down if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld by Israel?s high court. However if he is indicted he could face enormous public and political pressure to step down. Other Israeli prime ministers have been investigated including Ariel Sharon Ehud Barak and Olmert. 
254,50420,House Republicans pull plan to gut independent ethics committee  after Trump tweets,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump dramatically   House Republicans into line Tuesday in his first Washington power play after they voted to gut an ethics watchdog in a manner that undercut his vow to drain the establishment ?swamp.? Trump made clear his anger at the move on his Twitter account and GOP lawmakers hurriedly changed plans to target the independent panel backing down in a controversy that threatened to overshadow the dawn of a new conservative era in Washington. In an emergency meeting just before noon Tuesday House Republican lawmakers voted to strip the move on the ethics agency from a package of rules that is due to be voted upon later in the House of Representatives. Their decision to adopt the measure Monday night had opened splits in the GOP and put House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump on opposite sides of a key issue on the first day of the 115th Congress. The swift developments were a first sign of how Trump plans to govern and wield the power of his presidency    and his Twitter account    to bend Washington to his will and an early indication of the new power dynamic between Congress and the White House. Trump called out his fellow Republicans for proposing to curb the powers of the independent ethics panel as their first move of the year although the   suggested the ethics panel was ?unfair.?  ?With all that Congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog as unfair as it . .. may be their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS? Trump said over two consecutive tweets.  Monday night House Republicans voted   during a   meeting in favor of Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte?s proposal which would place the independent Office of Congressional Ethics under the control of those very lawmakers. The full House was set to vote on the plan Tuesday part of a larger package of House rules changes. But a public outcry as well as Trump?s tweets led to the language being dropped. A senior House GOP aide familiar with the discussion tells CNN that Ryan and Trump spoke Tuesday afternoon. ?The pressure was building in the press and from constituents this morning regarding the way the reforms were put into place last night. Early this morning it became clear we would have a vote problem on the floor with this amendment. Leadership called a special   meeting where it was agreed to by unanimous consent to strip the amendment? the aide said. ?It?s safe to say that Trump?s tweets probably added to that pressure but it was already being heavily covered in the press? the aide added. In the meeting Tuesday House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Republicans that the rules package didn?t have the votes Rep. Charlie Dent   said. After Trump?s tweets Ryan defended the proposed changes in a statement marking the first   break with the   just days into the new year. ?After eight years of operation many members believe the Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process and ensure it is operating according to its stated mission? Ryan said in a statement. ?I want to make clear that this House will hold its members to the highest ethical standards and the Office will continue to operate independently to provide public accountability to Congress.? An aide close to Ryan familiar with the discussions tells CNN that ?Ryan spoke out against the amendment and opposed it throughout. Today?s statement is an explanation of what the reform means and the action the speaker is taking to protect the office?s independence.? The proposed change in rules carried the appearance of House members taking power away from the office that can investigate them for misconduct at a time when Republicans are about to have control of two branches of government with a mandate for shaking up Washington.  Democratic dilemma: How hard to fight Trump The proposal would have barred the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of Congress requiring that it turn over complaints instead to the House Ethics Committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency. The House Ethics Committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff.  And the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of Congress. Currently the ethics panel operates as an independent   entity that has the power to investigate misconduct against lawmakers officers and staff of the United States House of Representatives. Originally created by Congress under Nancy Pelosi?s speakership in the wake of multiple lobbying scandals it continued to act as an independent body under   Speaker John Boehner.  Pelosi slammed the plan. ?House Republicans showed their true colors last night and reversing their plans to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics will not obscure their clear contempt for ethics in the People?s House? she said in a statement after the Republicans withdrew the proposal. ?Republicans should remember the strength of public outrage they faced in the space of 12 hours as they scheme to do lasting damage to the health and economic security of millions and millions of   families.?  In Monday?s meeting    members disregarded opposition from Ryan and voted to approve the new structure for ethics reviews going forward according to a senior House GOP leadership source familiar with the   discussion. Members of both parties complain that panel often takes up matters based on partisan accusations from outside groups with political motivations and once they launch a probe members have to mount expensive defense campaigns. In contrast to Trump?s tweets his close aide Kellyanne Conway appeared supportive of the move in Tuesday television interviews. ?If a constituent has a complaint they can still lodge that complaint? Conway told NBC?s ?Today? show adding that she hadn?t spoken with Trump on this issue specifically. ?They just can?t do it anonymously. And many of these people    members and their staffers who have been under investigation    they have complained about their due process rights being violated and compromised. They need protections as well.? Republicans defend the plan Goodlatte defended his proposal in the wake of the outrage Monday evening telling CNN that the move ?will make sure that work is properly done? but ?will also make sure that people who are wrongly charged have an opportunity to protect themselves.? ?There should be no entity in the entire federal government that doesn?t have review by some committee of the Congress so that?s all it sets up is oversight? he said. ?It still has its designated statutory responsibilities. It has some new rules that it has to follow but it still is empowered to take complaints from individuals as it was intended to do and investigate those complaints but every agency of the government whether it?s executive legislative or judicial should have a committee that reviews it?s work.? GOP Rep. Hal Rogers the Appropriations Committee chairman told reporters he backed the proposal because ?it?s the right thing to do.?  Rogers said there were ?numerous examples? of members ?who were falsely accused by this group who had to spend a fortune to get their good name restored so I think there?s been an abuse.? Texas Congressman Bill Flores also backed the change saying the panel is ?out of control? we don?t even get constitutional rights constitutional protections. They don?t tell us who accuses us and they leak the data    they are out of control.? Could come back Rep. Steve King   vowed to personally continue pressing for the ethics reforms.  He said Trump?s remarks ?animated the press?    leading the GOP to back away from what he said were changes that would have protected lawmakers from ?public criticism that?s generated by anonymous accusers.?  ?I?m concerned that now we have Republicans criticizing Republicans? King said. ?We need to stay away from that.?  Outside ethics group point to the ethics panel as the only real entity policing members and argue its independent status and bipartisan board are an appropriate way to oversee investigations. ?Gutting the independent ethics office is exactly the wrong way to start a new Congress? said Chris Carson spokesperson for League of Women Voters in a statement. ?This opens the door for special interest corruption just as the new Congress considers taxes and major infrastructure spending.?  Norman Eisen and Richard Painter of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington a nonprofit watchdog group said the ethics office ?has played a critical role in seeing that the congressional ethics process is no longer viewed as merely a means to sweep problems under the rug.?  ?If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining (the ethics office) it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated? they said in a Monday night statement. Eisen served as the top ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama and Painter held the same job under President George W. Bush. CNN?s Daniella Diaz Eric Bradner David Wright and Tal Kopan contributed to this report.
255,50421,Facing growing North Korea nuke threat Trump vows: ?It won?t happen!?,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump had a message Monday for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his latest missile threats. ?North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U. S. It won?t happen!? Trump tweeted.  Trump quickly followed that up with a charge that China was doing nothing to help the US cope with the rogue nation. ?China has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade but won?t help with North Korea. Nice!? Trump wrote. The   launched his verbal missiles after the autocratic    North Korean leader declared in a televised New Year?s Day speech that his military is on the brink of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile: a rocket that can be equipped with nuclear weapons and is powerful enough to reach any part of the US. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded Tuesday to Trump saying ?China?s efforts in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue have been obvious to all. Our contribution has been widely recognized by the international community. As the host of the   talks our efforts and achievements have been clear to all.? Jeffrey Lewis director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program (EANP) said Trump?s tweets were ?foolish but probably harmless.? ?I think North Korea will probably test the   (intercontinental ballistic missile) this year no matter what Trump tweets? he said in an email to CNN. While US officials and military experts doubt many of Kim?s boasts Trump may very well have to deal with an ICBM test and confront the danger Pyongyang poses to international stability. The hermit nation poses a unique threat. While the nuclear nations of China and Russia are both pushing back against US power across the globe they are more integrated into the international system and neither is as erratic or threatening. This all moves Pyongyang to Trump?s front burner as a simmering problem that might soon boil over. Kim declared Sunday that his goal was ?to cope against the vicious threats for nuclear war by the Imperialists? a sinister nod to the US and its Asian allies. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked on ?Good Morning America? on Tuesday what the   intended to do to stop North Korea?s nukes.  ?He?s not stated that publicly and he won?t before he?s inaugurated? Conway said. ?But we do know that there are sanctions that are possible? she added. ?They have not always worked. I think China would have to have a significant role here as well. But he?s putting North Korea on notice through this tweet and other statements that this won?t happen. He as President of the United States wants to stand between them and their missile capabilities which experts say could be deployed to reach Seattle almost immediately.? RELATED: Is North Korea?s leader the world?s ?most dangerous man?? North Korea has been steadily working to improve its missile and weapons capability conducting a fifth nuclear test in September. American analysts say there are still questions about Pyongyang?s claims of technological advances    particularly to key elements required to deliver a nuclear payload    but the picture is still worrisome. ?It?s a very real and growing threat? said Bruce Klinger a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ?Think Don Corleone but with nuclear weapons.?  North Korea might be easy to ridicule as ?the funny little country with the funny little guy with the funny little hairstyle out of Jersey Shore? that can?t even provide electricity to its people Klingner said. But ?North Korea is a   threat to the US its allies and international peace and security.? ?This is the worst regime in the world trying to acquire the worst weapons in the world and the means to reach the US with them? Victor Cha a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said of North Korea. ?In terms of a direct threat to American security this is it.?  Russian Chinese threats differ  He said that threat is different than that from major powers Russia and China. ?With Russia and China we?re mutually deterred? because of nuclear capabilities he explained. ?With North Korea you just don?t know what this guy is going to do.? Pyongyang has a   army poised along the border with South Korea where US forces are based. The state engages in massive counterfeiting operations of the US $100 bill and in the manufacturing of methamphetamine. US security officials place it in the top five cyber threats worldwide. It has an estimated 16 to 20 nuclear weapons and is steadily working to miniaturize them and improve the range and accuracy of missiles to deliver them. North Korea?s new boast about an ICBM that could deliver those weapons to the US comes as Washington is undergoing a leadership transition    always a fragile time    and South Korea is in political disarray with its president temporarily stripped of her powers because of corruption charges and facing a court ruling on whether she should be reinstated or removed from office. Kim sees 2017 as ?an opportune time? to complete development of a nuclear weapon because of these leadership challenges according to a   North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea. Kim is ?determined? to complete development of a nuclear weapon by the end of 2017 the diplomat said at a December press briefing according to Yonhap news agency.  ?This is not just   to get attention? Cha said. ?This is an actual military goal they?re seeking.? And they?re well on their way despite repeated international attempts over decades to slow Pyongyang?s program through sanctions and diplomacy. North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2016 and a satellite launch that experts call a sign that it has cleared significant hurdles toward ICBM technology.  It has already notched other potentially lethal successes.  Pyongyang fired a   ballistic missile in August a weapon that South Korea has no viable defense against said Klingner a former chief of the CIA?s Korea branch. After the test the South Korean Defense Ministry revised its estimate on the North?s ability to deploy   missiles from around four years to as little as a year.  The country likely already has working nuclear warheads for its Nodong   ballistic missile which threatens all of South Korea and Japan experts say. And Pyongyang?s intermediate range missile the Musudan can hit Guam the location of a major US military base and a critical node in the defense of the western Pacific Ocean. It isn?t clear whether North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the Musudan yet. The ICBM would be the next level up putting the continental US within Pyongyang?s deadly reach. US   generals including Gen. Vincent Brooks who leads US forces in South Korea and Adm. Harry Harris head of US Pacific Command say North Korea is nearing that capability. Other experts don?t think Pyongyang is quite there yet but say it likely will be within Trump?s first term. Struggling to deliver nukes Bruce Bennett a a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation says that despite North Korea?s apparent progress on a warhead it doesn?t yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke. A key question is whether they have the technology that would allow the missiles to   the atmosphere. North Koreans have this capability for the intermediate range Musudan missile which can hit South Korea and Japan. It?s a harder technological feat to achieve   capability for an ICBM which is subject to higher temperatures and greater velocities. For now US military officials told CNN that they assess that North Korea still hasn?t mastered that technology or key elements of firing and fuzing a weapon.   ?They?re likely further along than many experts and pundits give them credit for? according to Klingner. ?We may not know where they are on that path but we know they?re on it.?  Kim boasted in his New Year?s remarks that his country has successfully tested a variety of ICBM technologies. ?Research and development of the   tech weapons are actively progressing and strengthening our defense capabilities including   preparation of tests for intercontinental ballistic rocket launch have been continuously succeeding? he declared. If the young leader goes ahead an ICBM test would be a flagrant violation of numerous United Nations resolutions and beg a response from Trump. The   has called Kim a ?maniac? but has also said he would sit down and negotiate with him a break from   international norms.  A test would also deepen worries in South Korea and Japan already rattled by suggestions from candidate Trump that the US should cover less of their defense and  in another violation of international norms that they should develop their own nuclear programs.  Increasing tension with China And it would immediately increase tensions between the US and North Korea?s closest ally China which Trump has suggested has ?total control? over Pyongyang. If China won?t rein North Korea in Trump has suggested the US should ?make trade very difficult? with Beijing. He has also suggested that he would have China assassinate the North Korean leader to make him ?disappear in one form or another very quickly.?  Cha said the decision to stop North Korea from reaching the point where it could deter the US by threatening Honolulu or Los Angeles with destruction will be a personal one that the   will likely have to make. While some experts estimate Pyongyang will have an ICBM by 2020 Cha thinks it will be sooner. ?If the President decides this can?t stand then all kinds of options open up for him? to take action Cha said including significant shifts in the US force posture in Asia and exerting greater pressure on China.
256,50422,Dylann Roof ruled competent for sentencing,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) A federal judge ruled Monday that Dylann Roof convicted of killing nine people inside an   church in Charleston South Carolina is mentally competent to represent himself at the sentencing phase of his trial. That phase is scheduled to begin Wednesday morning at 9:30. Roof could be sentenced to death.  Roof was evaluated over the weekend by Dr. James Ballenger of Charleston a specialist in forensic psychiatry with the results presented in court. US District Judge Richard Gergel closed that part of the proceeding to the public saying he wanted to protect Roof?s right to a fair trial and right to  . Ballenger evaluated Roof in November before Roof was found competent after a   hearing Gergel?s order said. But the court ?felt that the serious nature of the proceedings? against Roof indicated the need for another evaluation by the   Ballenger ?to confirm there were no material changes in his mental status? since then.  Ballenger and other witnesses testified during the daylong hearing Monday and Gergel ruled Roof ?remains competent to stand trial and  .? A more comprehensive opinion is expected to follow.  Roof?s sentencing phase had been scheduled for Tuesday but he requested an additional day because he had been required to spend most of the previous days on the court?s examination and competency hearing according to the order.  Earlier Gergel issued an order that said Roof ?will not attempt to approach the jury the witness stand or the bench? during the sentencing.  A federal jury convicted Roof on December 15 of all charges stemming from the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Roof attended a Bible study on June 17 2015 before pulling out a pistol and killing nine people investigators said. Roof carefully planned the killing investigators said and chose the church because he wanted to start a race war. Roof is white and all his victims were black. In a videotaped interview with detectives that was played for the jury Roof said ?I did it.? Roof?s second competency hearing was called at the request of defense lawyer David Bruck who said he?d discovered new facts. After the first competency hearing in November the judge sealed a document with the factual reasons behind his ruling saying disclosure could hurt Roof?s chances of a fair trial. Some family members of victims appear torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Only three federal inmates have been executed in the United States since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 after a   moratorium.  Timothy McVeigh was convicted for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people. He was executed June 11 2001. Juan Raul Garza was convicted of killing three people and running a marijuana drug ring in Texas. He was executed June 19 2001. Louis Jones was convicted for the kidnapping and murder of    Army Pvt. Tracie McBride. He was executed March 18 2003. The last person given a federal death sentence was bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2015 after he was convicted for his role in killing four people and wounding others in the 2013 Boston Marathon according to the Death Penalty Information Center a Washington based nonprofit.  The US government and US military have 62 people awaiting execution the center said.

Trump stands apart from the US intelligence community over whether Russia was behind the hacking aimed at meddling with the US election. ?It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don?t know and so they cannot be sure of the situation? he told reporters on New Year?s Eve. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew Trump said: ?You?ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.? GOP senator: I?ll ?wait and see? what Trump says on Russia?s role in hacking Conway said the hacks have become an issue because Democrats lost the 2016 election. She added that Trump is expected to receive an intelligence briefing this week at Trump Tower. ?What I can say is that we don?t believe that intelligence efforts should interfere into politics certainly? she said. ?But we also don?t believe that politics should interfere with our intelligence.? The FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a report last week that they said ?provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election.? The report added that the Russian hackers also have historically targeted ?a range of US government political and private sector entities? using similar tactics.

260,50428,GOP senator: I?ll ?wait and see? what Trump says on Russia?s role in hacking,CNN,Daniella Diaz,1/3/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Republican Sen. James Lankford said he will ?wait and see? what   Donald Trump knows about the Russian hacking in the United States. Trump stands apart from the US intelligence community over whether Russia was behind the hacking aimed at meddling with the US election. ?It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don?t know and so they cannot be sure of the situation? he told reporters on New Year?s Eve. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew Trump said: ?You?ll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.? Adviser contradicts Trump: Russians hacked the US Lankford who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee told CNN?s Erin Burnett on ?OutFront? on Monday: ?He can come out on Tuesday and Wednesday and get a chance to present that out but at this point I want to just wait and see what that is.? Lankford added that he has doesn?t have ?any doubt? that Russia is responsible for the hacking. ?The Russians have been engaged in hacking for elections . .. all over Europe all over Asia all over their neighbors? he said. ?I don?t have any doubt that it is from Russia? he said. ?This meets the mode that they do all over the world and all over the region already.? On Monday former CIA Director James Woolsey an adviser to Trump on national security issues told CNN?s Jim Sciutto that determining who was behind the hacks is difficult but that he believes the Russians    and possibly others    were involved. ?I think the Russians were in there but it doesn?t mean other people weren?t too? Woolsey said. ?It?s often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks. There?s lots of tricks.?
261,50429,Adviser contradicts Trump: Russians hacked the US,CNN,Barbara Starr,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) A top adviser to   Donald Trump said Monday he thinks the Russians were involved in   hacking of the US    a very different view than that held by the incoming administration.  Former CIA director James Woolsey an adviser to Trump on national security issues told CNN?s Jim Sciutto that determining who was behind the hacks is difficult but that he believes the Russians    and possibly others    were involved. ?I think the Russians were in there but it doesn?t mean other people weren?t too? he said. ?It?s often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks. There?s lots of tricks.? Asked if Trump is playing the media with his comments on who was culpable Woolsey said it was a ?possibility? noting that Trump is an ?expert in weaving around? on issues like this. ?Sometimes people may have been talking to somebody in the National Security Agency and have an idea that maybe it was one type of hacking rather than another? he said. ?I don?t think this is of substantial matter. I think it?s basically just dialogue back and forth.? Speaking on Tuesday on CNN?s ?New Day? Woolsey stressed his belief that more than one country was involved in hacking US Democratic organizations and individuals. ?Is it Russian? Probably some? the Trump adviser told Chris Cuomo adding that China and Iran could also have been involved. ?It shouldn?t be portrayed as one guilty party. It?s much  more complicated than that.? He added ?This is not an organized an operation . .. It?s not like taking a number at a bakery and standing in line to politely get your dozen cookies . .. it?s more like a bunch of jackals at the carcass of an antelope.? Woolsey?s comments come even as Trump and his aides continue to cast doubt on the links between Russia and recent hacks against Democrats while US intelligence officials say that newly identified ?digital fingerprints? indicate Moscow was behind the intrusions. One official told CNN the administration has traced the hack to the specific keyboards    which featured Cyrillic characters    that were used to construct the malware code adding that the equipment leaves ?digital fingerprints? and in the case of the recent hacks those prints point to the Russian government. In response to the US information Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov told CNN: ?I don?t understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere. Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way.?  Despite an initial public assessment by the US intelligence community in October that Russia was behind the intrusions Trump and his staff continue to voice doubts.  ?The idea that we?re jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is frankly irresponsible? Trump?s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer told CNN?s Alisyn Camerota Monday. Trump expressed skepticism on New Year?s Eve saying ?I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.? He also claimed to have inside information on the matter which he said he would reveal later this week. Asked how Trump would be getting that type of information Woolsey said on ?New Day? that people inside the US intelligence community may be reaching out for Trump. ?He could have people talking to him from within the system? Woolsey said. Spicer said Trump was ?going to talk about his conclusions and where he thinks things stand? adding the   would ?make sure people understand that there?s a lot of questions out there.? A second US official told CNN Monday there is increasingly confidence in the intelligence analysis citing the ability to collect extremely   intel on Russia compared the difficulty of doing so with more secretive regimes like North Korea. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security released a report last week that they said ?provides technical details regarding the tools and infrastructure used by the Russian civilian and military intelligence Services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election.? The report added that the Russian culprits also have historically targeted ?a range of US Government political and private sector entities? using similar tactics. Spicer said Trump would await the results of the investigation ordered by President Barack Obama as he insisted that the assessments of the intelligence community published so far did not constitute the ?final report.?  He said Trump was expected to be briefed about that report in coming days.  Trump is facing mounting pressure to undertake a robust response to Russia?s activities with Republican leaders in Congress saying that Obama?s recent   sanctions of Russian intelligence entities and expulsion of some Russians from the US don?t go far enough. ?It is clear that Russia has attacked the United States of America. All of our intelligence agencies will affirm that that?s been the case. We will work in the Congress to have stronger sanctions in order to prevent further attacks? Republican Sen. John McCain said while in Georgia a country that fought a war with Russia in 2008. McCain who was also visiting NATO?s easternmost members in the Baltic region and the Ukraine also promised to hold hearings into the   when Congress is back in session this month.
262,50431,Trump: Chicago mayor should ask feds to help combat homicides,CNN,Daniella Diaz,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump said Monday that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal assistance to combat homicides in the nation?s   city. ?Chicago murder rate is record setting   4 331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can?t do it he must ask for Federal help!? Trump tweeted. Trump?s tweet accurately relayed Chicago?s homicide numbers. And while they are not ?record setting? The Chicago Tribune reports that homicides were up 60% from 2015 to the highest levels in 20 years. Emanuel who was President Barack Obama?s chief of staff from January 2009 to October 2010 met with Trump in New York last month urging the   to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program until a modernized immigration system can be decided by Congress.   Emanuel?s administration said Monday it looks ?forward to working with? Trump on crime. ?As the   knows from his conversation with the mayor we agree the federal government has a strong role to play in public safety by funding summer jobs and prevention programming for   youth by holding the criminals who break our gun laws accountable for their crimes by passing meaningful gun laws and by building on the partnerships our police have with federal law enforcement? said Adam Collins Emanuel?s director of communications in a statement following Trump?s tweet.  He added: ?We are heartened he is taking this issue seriously and look forward to working with the new administration on these important efforts.? The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what federal help his administration might offer Chicago to combat homicide. But California Republican Rep. Darrel Issa told CNN?s Wolf Blitzer on ?The Situation Room? that Emanuel needs to communicate with Trump to combat crime. ?What Rahm needs to do is he does need to work with   Trump when he?s President and ask for the federal help that will allow him to break up these pockets of very bad people and let his police work on commuting policing? he said. ?This combination works.? This isn?t the first time Trump has talked about Chicago?s crime rate. Often on the campaign trail Trump would mention Chicago while suggesting that controversial tactics such as    could help address the issue. ?A policy like    could save thousands of lives in a city like Chicago just like it saved thousands of lives in New York. Overwhelmingly this will save   and Hispanic lives    citizens who are entitled to the same protections as every American? Trump said during a September rally in Florida. While    policies are used in various US cities the aggressive implementation of    in New York was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 who said the policy violated the rights of minorities who were disproportionately targeted. The focus on Chicago homicides comes as Obama is set to deliver his farewell address to the nation on January 10 from his home city he announced Monday. ?I?m thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey to celebrate the ways you?ve changed this country for the better these past eight years and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here? Obama said of his planned Chicago farewell speech. 
263,50433,Prisoners decapitated in Brazil riot over drug turf,CNN,Euan McKirdy,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) A   uprising at a prison in Brazil claimed the lives of at least 56 prisoners over the weekend   media agency Agencia Brasil reported Monday.  Bodies were thrown over the wall of the complex and at least six people were decapitated the news agency reported.  The revolt started Sunday afternoon as part of a rivalry between two criminal organizations at the Anisio Jobim Prison Complex in the city of Manaus Agencia Brasil reported citing Sergio Fontes the public safety secretary for the state of Amazonas. Violence erupted on Sunday between incarcerated members of the the Familia do Norte (FDN) and the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) groups. The riot lasted for more than 17 hours.  The FDN controls drug trafficking and the ?inside of prison complexes? according to state media. Fontes said that the riot started over control of the drug trade behind the prison walls.  ?They weren?t fighting because one is called one thing and the other one is called another. They are fighting for money? he said. ?There is a silent war going on and the state must intervene. What is this war? Drug trafficking. What did we see today? One faction fighting with another.? Among the hostages were 74 prisoners and an unknown number of prison guards Fontes said. Authorities said they did not know how many prisoners might have escaped from the complex. Separate prison break As the riot raged ?dozens? of prisoners orchestrated an escape from another Manaus prison the Antonio Trindade Penal Institute (Ipat). Fontes speculated that the jailbreak could have been arranged as a ?smokescreen? for the Anisio Jobim riot according to the Agencia Brasil report.  Prisoners also caused a ?commotion? at one other penitentiary according to the Amazonas public security secretariat.  Security forces did not enter the Anisio Jobim complex due to the ?unpredictable? nature of the situation. According to Fontes the riot ?was managed with negotiation and respect for the human rights.? He said said the riot instigators will be identified and held accountable for the murders and other crimes.  Extra funding requested Alexandre de Moraes Brazil?s justice minister told reporters on Monday evening in Manaus that the gang members responsible for the riot will be transferred to federal prisons. ?This is an important step to identify and remove those that headed this absurd riot on the first of the year? he said. Following the New Year?s incident the government of the state of Amazonas has called for federal support to combat drug trafficking and strengthen security in Brazil?s detention centers.   Fontes said the preliminary investigation suggests the riot was premeditated.  ?Everything indicates that the acts were planned over a long period of time? he said.  ?The inmates had established with the administration (of the prison) a promise that everything would run smoothly throughout the holidays and there wouldn?t be any problems. They didn?t keep their promise but you can?t expect much from criminals can you?? The number of prisoners killed in Sunday?s incident is the highest since the deadly 1992 Carandiru massacre. In that case 111 inmates died after police stormed the Carandiru penitentiary following a riot.
264,50434,How Trump can reshape the federal courts,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) Donald Trump is poised to cement the conservative majority on the Supreme Court but he will also play a critical role in reshaping the look of the lower courts as he moves to fill over 100 vacancies in the federal judiciary.  Experts say that the unusually high number of vacancies    due in part to judicial warfare between the Obama administration and the   Senate    could change the face of the courts.  ?If   Trump can put a different face on the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals he could substantially change the course of federal jurisprudence? said Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution. As things stand now there are 103 vacancies in the appeals and district courts. The Administrative Office of the US Courts defines 38 of those as judicial ?emergencies? or those where vacancies have existed for an extended period of time in areas with a high number of filings. For comparison President Barack Obama had 59 vacancies when he took office. A shift in the courts could impact   issues such as abortion gun control environmental protection and transgender rights.  To be sure the current vacancies include seats that had been held by judges who were originally nominated by Republican presidents. It?s also true that a nominee doesn?t always fulfill the vision of the person who places him on the bench. But the large number gives Trump and unusual opportunity to make his mark on the judiciary.  ?Republicans in the 114th Senate confirmed an abnormally low number of judges creating an abnormally high number of vacancies for Trump to fill? said Wheeler.  Although critics say that Obama was slow out of the gate in filling seats early in his tenure by the end of his administration he had appointed 323 district and circuit court judges according to Wheeler slightly more than George W. Bush.  But he was also President when the Senate changed the rules. Frustrated by Republican efforts to block nominees the Democrats triggered the so called ?nuclear option which allowed the President?s judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with only 51 votes. Supreme Court nominees are exempt from the change and still subject to the   threshold.  Perhaps the impact of the rules change was most evident on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. After the ?nuclear option? eliminating the Senate filibuster Obama pushed through three more nominees on that court which is often called the ?second most important court in the land? because it reviews actions by federal agencies.  ?Republicans resisted filling vacant seats on the Court of Appeals arguing that the court didn?t need the judges. That was the straw that broke the camel?s back and led the Democrats to change the filibuster rules and shortly thereafter the Senate confirmed three pending nominees? said Wheeler.  Trump?s task will be complicated by the fact that Senate leaders usually honor a   rule that home state senators of either party must approve a nominee before they process it.
265,50435,Istanbul attack: Teenager?s holiday trip ends in tragedy,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Leanne Nasser begged her parents to let her go to Istanbul. She had never been abroad. Never left Israel. Her three friends were going to the city on the Bosporus to celebrate New Year?s Eve and she wanted to go with them. Her father refused. He was worried Istanbul wasn?t safe and he wanted her to stay home. Despondent she turned to her aunt Layal Masarweh who intervened on her behalf.  ?Her father was totally against that. He was saying that Istanbul is too dangerous and that she should not go at all. But she insisted saying that nothing will happen to her? Masarweh told CNN.  Nasser 18 from Tira an Arab town in central Israel had big plans for the future after finishing high school in June. She worked at a dental clinic and was saving to buy a car. She wanted to be a dentist one day. But first was New Year?s Eve and celebrating the start of 2017. The four women made their way to the Reina restaurant on the Bosporus in Istanbul. A few hours before midnight she posted a picture to Snapchat. In it she flashed a   a floral crown atop her long dark hair. Her brown eyes looked straight at the camera. The following morning    after a terrorist opened fire inside the club after 39 people were killed and dozens more injured after emergency responders started working through the massacre    Nasser was missing. Her three friends were found    two were uninjured. One was in the hospital having sustained moderate injuries in the attack but she was in stable condition and was expected to recover. Nasser?s father caught the next flight to Turkey    a   flight from Tel Aviv. Hours passed as her family held out hope. She might have survived. She might be in a different hospital. She might be OK. At home in Tira her uncle?s phone buzzed. It was her father. He had sent over some pictures. A   gold ring with specks of blood on the band. A necklace with purple and green gemstones. A silver purse with blood that had seeped between the sparkles. The authorities were wondering if her family could identify them. And her father couldn?t remember if they were Leanne?s. The uncle stared at the pictures for a moment. He showed the photos to Nasser?s aunt. There was no doubt anymore. They were Leanne?s. She had died in the attack. ?I cannot forgive myself? said her aunt Layal Masarweh.  ?I wish I was with her to defend her or do anything to save her life. I wish they took my soul and gave it to her.? Nasser?s body will be flown home on Tuesday three days into 2017. Her family is waiting for her to come home. The tears have not stopped and the grief is still too near. ?I still cannot believe it happened and that she was killed? Masarweh said.  It was Leanne Nasser?s first trip abroad. And it will be her last trip home.
266,50436,Alcohol abuse linked to higher heart risks study says,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) An estimated 10 million to 15 million Americans abuse alcohol meaning excessive drinking negatively affects their lives. Now research suggests a link between too much drinking and heart problems the No. 1 cause of death worldwide.  Abusing alcohol increases the likelihood of suffering atrial fibrillation heart attack or congestive heart failure according to a study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. ?One of the most surprising findings. .. is that people who abused alcohol are at increased risk for heart attack or myocardial infarction? said Dr. Gregory M. Marcus director of clinical research in the Division of Cardiology at the University of California San Francisco and senior author of the study. Past data suggests that moderate drinking may be protective he said helping ward off this disease. Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum director of women?s heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City believes that both scientists and the media have been highlighting the good components of alcohol such as resveratrol in wine and ?been really pushing that a glass of wine is good for our health.? But the bottom line of this new study is clear she said. ?When we look at alcohol we have almost glamorized it as being this substance that can help us live a really   life? said Steinbaum who was not involved in the research. ?I think ultimately drinking in excess leads to heart conditions and we should really understand the potential toxicity of alcohol and not glamorize it as something we should include as part of our lives    certainly not in excess.? Millions of patient records The National Institutes of Health frequently highlight the ways in which too much drinking can lead to accidents cirrhosis and some cancers. Yet cardiovascular studies have suggested that moderate consumption of alcohol is good for our heart health.  The authors of the new study cite a 2007 study published in the journal Circulation. Not only did moderate drinking lead to no negative effects the study authors concluded that ?moderate drinking may lower the risk of heart failure.?  Since many of us believe that ?more of a good thing is always better? Marcus and his colleagues decided to investigate how excessive drinking might impact our risk of developing atrial fibrillation or arrhythmic beating of the heart myocardial infarction or heart attack and congestive heart failure a chronic condition in which the heart cannot effectively push blood through the arteries and circulatory system to the body?s other organs and tissues.  For data Marcus and his colleagues turned to the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project?s California State Ambulatory Surgery Databases Emergency Department Databases and State Inpatient Databases. They looked at California residents 21 or older who had been hospitalized anytime between 2005 and 2009.  All told Marcus and his team analyzed the medical records of 14 727 591 patients.  Of these 1. 8% or approximately 268 000 had been diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Marcus said there was no specific cutoff regarding a specific amount of alcohol or time period and admitted that this was a limitation of the study.  Within the study then alcohol abuse was defined as instances in which a health care provider flagged a patient as having a problem with excessive alcohol use either ?acutely?   showing up for an appointment drunk for example    or chronically    such as having an addiction or reliance on alcohol explained Marcus. According to Dr. Scott Krakower assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital in New Hyde Park New York alcohol abuse is generally not dependence. Instead it?s when ?you?re using it excessively at times and it?s getting in the way of functioning.? ?Abuse doesn?t necessarily lead to a pattern where you use it every day and you?re developing a tolerance or developing withdrawal symptoms? said Krakower who was not involved in the study. He added that alcohol abuse is when ?you start having problems with alcohol it might affect you physically but it can also have social implications and psychological implications? such as trouble with relationships or problems at work. Some heart risks double In surveying the data on millions of patients Marcus and his colleagues discovered that alcohol abuse was associated with atrial fibrillation heart attack and heart failure.  Specifically they found that alcohol abuse was associated with a doubled risk of atrial fibrillation a 1.  higher risk of heart attack and a 2.  increased risk of congestive heart failure.  ?It didn?t matter if you had a conventional risk factor for these diseases or not. In every case alcohol abuse increased the risk? Marcus said. That said Marcus and his colleagues discovered that the number of people who would develop either atrial fibrillation heart attack or heart failure in three years was much higher if they had an established risk factor and abused alcohol. They also compared alcohol abuse to the conventional risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure and diabetes. ?In general if someone abused alcohol it appeared to increase the risk to a similar magnitude to other conventional risk factors? Marcus said. Eliminating alcohol abuse would result in over 73 000 fewer atrial fibrillation cases 34 000 fewer heart attacks and 91 000 fewer patients with congestive heart failure in the US alone the researchers estimated. Motivation to quit When it comes to helping patients with alcohol abuse Krakower said primary care doctors can use the latest    guidance tools to screen patients and ?see if a person has a problem with alcohol and from there determine what level of intervention is necessary.? From there Krakower said treatment options include motivational interviewing a type of therapy in which the goal is for a patient to ?find some motivation to quit.? There?s also group therapy   therapy techniques and of course Alcoholics Anonymous. Still there are nuances when it comes to drinking. ?We have an understanding (by the American Heart Association) that a glass of wine a day for women and two glasses of wine a day for men are good? Steinbaum said. ?What is a glass? Four to 6 ounces.?  Yet if you go out to dinner and order a glass of wine she said with a laugh ?it?s like 12 ounces!? The exact equation of how much is too much has never really been answered and ?part of the reason for that is metabolism is different in everyone? Steinbaum said. Metabolism of alcohol is slower for women than for men and individual fat distribution and muscle mass also play into how quickly alcohol is metabolized.  ?It becomes a very individual thing? she said. ?The American Heart Association has given us very conservative guidelines saying if you?re going to drink this is how much but the big picture is alcohol in excess    and excess is more than a very minimal amount    is bad for your heart.? Still no matter the characteristics of any individual patient excessive alcohol is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation and heart failure Marcus said: ?Increasing awareness of this both among practitioners and individuals may actually reduce or prevent those important diseases.?
267,50438,Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak retires,CNN,Jill Martin,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Less than a year after winning the Super Bowl Gary Kubiak is leaving his position as Denver Broncos head coach. At a press conference on Monday an emotional Kubiak said that he was retiring from coaching because the demands of the job were becoming too much for him. ?Coaching is a very demanding business? he said. ?Tough business. And I?ve always prided myself. You know I?ve been a head coach for 10 years. And each of us as coaches. .. we all have a routine. We all have a way we go about doing things and I?ve had my routine for a long time. And I?ve always taken a lot of pride that I could coach a football team be there for the players be there for the coaches be there for the organization do a game plan call some plays on Sunday. I?ve always taken a lot of pride in the fact that I could do all of those things. ?But this year I haven?t been able to do that. It?s been tough. And for the first time I?ve had to tell myself ?Hey you can?t do that anymore. ?? Kubiak 55 has had more than one health scare in his career. He missed Denver?s game on October 13 against the San Diego Chargers because of a complex migraine condition. When he was head coach of the Houston Texans Kubiak suffered a transient ischemic attack    commonly known as a      when he collapsed during a game in 2013. Kubiak said he didn?t immediately start thinking of retirement after his medical emergency in October. ?That was obviously an episode that took place and I?ve had a couple in the last four years but it wasn?t like ?OK this is something that I can?t handle?? he said. ?I wouldn?t say that. It was a struggle for me throughout the course of the year just keeping up with the things that I normally do and the way I want to do them. . .. It was not one incident but I am listening to the last few years.? Broncos general manager John Elway said Kubiak approached him about a week ago to talk about stepping down. Elway said that Kubiak a Broncos teammate in their playing days asked him to have a conversation as his friend instead of as his boss. Elway said he has mixed emotions about Kubiak leaving and acknowledged he checked to see whether he would change his mind and come back. But as a friend Elway said he understood Kubiak?s decision. ?In the long run it?s the right thing for Gary and I think that?s the most important thing? Elway said. Kubiak was   in his two seasons as Denver?s coach. Last season Kubiak led Denver to a   win in Super Bowl 50 in February against the Carolina Panthers. Following the win however the Broncos took a step back. Quarterback Peyton Manning retired and his backup Brock Osweiler left for the Houston Texans. That left the Broncos with Trevor Siemian a   draft pick in 2015 to start their title defense. The Broncos finished this season   and didn?t reach the playoffs. In his 10 seasons as an NFL head coach Kubiak was  . He spent 22 years with the Broncos including nine as a quarterback from   and 11 as offensive coordinator from  .

268,50439,Blue states should take Trump?s tax cut money and run,CNN,,1/2/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) A few days after winning the presidency Donald Trump visited Manhattan?s posh 21 Club and told the swells dining there ?We?ll get your taxes down. Don?t worry about it.?  So far he seems intent on following through. Congressional Republicans are working on a   plan that in practice would benefit the   . And Trump?s pick of spending hawk Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Budget and Management suggests that government programs may indeed be slashed to make such tax cuts palatable to fiscal conservatives.   Democratic lawmakers representing liberal parts of America habitually denounce this sort of thing: Spending reductions combined with tax cuts benefiting upper incomes. The question is ?should they?? and the answer is ?no.? The blue states should take the money and run.   The time has come for liberals to recognize that the Republican agenda    which they have little control over anyway    can work to their advantage. Who gets the least return on the money they send to Washington? The economically successful blue states. Which states most depend on federal spending?  The poorer red ones.   Most of the proposed federal tax reforms would leave more wealth in the affluent blue states. They could capture some of it through their own taxes and economic activity unleashed by residents with more money in their pockets. Repealing Obamacare alone would deliver tax cuts totaling $346 billion over 10 years every penny going to households making $200 000 or more. Interesting that the 12 states with the largest percentage of such households all voted for Hillary Clinton.  No more universal health coverage?  Not necessarily. Massachusetts has Romneycare a wildly popular   system that served as a model for the Affordable Care Act.  Insurers there expect little upheaval from an Obamacare repeal.   Massachusetts by the way has the strongest economy in the country according to Governing magazine. California?s   insurance exchange is in good shape notes Nicholas Bagley a professor at the University of Michigan Law School.  California could simply adopt its own individual mandate as Obamacare does. Requiring everyone to buy coverage (or pay a fine) brings healthy people into the insurance pools. Having the young and hearty subsidize the sick and elderly keeps the pools stable. Connecticut New York Oregon and Washington are in especially good positions to do likewise Bagley says. Trump?s choice of Scott Pruitt a   denialist to head the Environmental Protection Agency alarms environmentalists. So does Peter Navarro as head of a new White House trade council.  Navarro has accused NASA of ?politically correct environmental monitoring? of climate change through its   satellites.  No matter.  ?If Trump turns off the satellites ? Gov. Jerry Brown said ?California will launch its own damn satellite.? Given California?s lead in confronting climate change we can well believe that Brown who heads the world?s fifth biggest economy would follow through on that promise.  You can bet that the work to build the satellites would almost all land in California.  In 2004 California set   standards higher than the federal government?s.  Twelve other states followed California?s lead and after an unsuccessful suit to stop the stricter standards the auto industry came around.   In 2010 California required that 33% of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2020. It was recently raised to 50% by 2030. Now 30 states have renewable energy requirements.  ?  ? is a   approach to cutting emissions of   greenhouse gases. When Congress failed to pass    legislation California set up its own system. As of this writing 10 states have done likewise.  This isn?t just environmental  . It is economic development. Almost 60% of all   venture capital in the United States ends up in California.  The federal income tax has been called a   tax because the higher incomes tend to cluster in Democratic strongholds. What?s especially unfair about this is the federal tax code does not account for cost of living which is highest in the elite coastal cities.   Someone making $90 000 in Houston would have to pull in $162 000 to live as well in San Francisco according to BankRate?s calculator.  Yet all else being equal the San Franciscan pays far more taxes to the federal government than the Houstonian. There?s no reason why   states can?t get together and solve problems including local challenges and international ones like climate change. For the richer blue states a reduced federal tax burden would leave them with the added means to address these challenges.  And the nicest part: They can spend the money at home. 
269,50441,Dylann Roof: ?There?s nothing wrong with me psychologically?,CNN,Martin Savidge,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Charleston South Carolina (CNN) Convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof began making his case in court Wednesday addressing jurors for the first time as they weigh whether to give him a death sentence. ?There?s nothing wrong with me psychologically? Roof said during his brief opening statement. Three people who?d been sitting in the section of the courtroom reserved for friends and family of the victims walked out while Roof spoke. One said ?This is all crap? as he left. Roof wearing a gray knit sweater and speaking so softly that people in the courtroom strained to hear him told jurors to disregard the arguments his attorneys made in the earlier phase of the trial. ?Anything you heard from my lawyers in the last phase I ask you to forget it? he said. ?That?s the last thing.? Prosecutor details Roof?s jailhouse journal Last month jurors convicted Roof of federal murder and hate crimes charges for the June 2015 massacre at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.  Now the white supremacist who killed nine people at the historically black church is representing himself in court as the jury decides whether he will face life in prison or the death penalty. Assistant US Attorney Nathan Williams argued Wednesday that a number of factors show Roof deserves a death sentence. Among them: the avowed white supremacist?s motive his lack of remorse and the shooting?s impact on the victims? families. ?The defendant didn?t stop after shooting one or four or five people. That?s why this case is worse? Williams said. ?He killed because of the color of their skin. He thought they were less as people. He wanted to magnify and incite violence.? The prosecutor presented new evidence including a jailhouse journal that he said was written six weeks after Roof?s arrest.  ?I do not regret what I did? the journal entry said according to Williams. ?I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. I do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick county. I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower races. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed.? The journal entry echoes racist statements from Roof that prosecutors presented earlier in the trial.  But the jailhouse writings reveal something significant Williams argued. Roof the prosecutor said is capable of remorse    but felt none for his crimes.  Family friends of victims testify Also on Wednesday the jury began hearing from people who lost relatives or friends in the massacre. Jennifer Pinckney widow of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney  was in a nearby room with a daughter when the shooting occurred. She testified about her relationship with her husband and about the shooting.  When police arrived a female officer told the daughter they were going to play a game Pinckney said. The officer encouraged the girl to put her head on her shoulder and keep her eyes closed.  But Jennifer Pinckey was unable to avoid catching a glimpse of the scene. She said she was walking to the door when she saw blood on the floor.  ?I felt sick? she said. ?I leaned over and they rushed me out.? She believes she survived to continue her husband?s legacy. ?He did so much. And he was so many things to so many people? she said. Some of the most emotional testimony came from the Rev. Anthony Thompson whose wife Myra was killed. ?Gone. What am I here for if she?s gone? There?s nothing left for me to do now. The person I live for is gone? he said before only his weeping could be heard in the courtroom. At one point Roof objected to   members testifying saying too many people were speaking. The judge denied his objection. Some family members of victims have appeared torn over whether Roof should be sentenced to death. Federal death row Roof also is scheduled to be tried on state murder charges for which he could also be sentenced to death. Only three federal inmates have been executed in the United States since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988 after a   moratorium: ? Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh on June 11 2001 six years after he killed 168 people. ? Juan Raul Garza on June 19 2001 eight years after he was convicted of running a marijuana drug ring and killing three people. ? Louis Jones on March 18 2003 eight years after he kidnapped and murdered    Army Pvt. Tracie McBride. Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the last person to get a federal death sentence. He?s one of 62 federal prisoners awaiting execution according to the Death Penalty Information Center a   nonprofit. 
270,50442,Israeli soldier convicted of manslaughter,CNN,Oren Liebermann,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Tel Aviv Israel (CNN) An Israeli military court convicted an Israeli soldier of manslaughter Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a wounded Palestinian knife attack suspect. The Palestinian Abdel Fattah   21 was one of two men accused of stabbing another Israeli soldier in the West Bank city of Hebron in March. Charges were brought against Sgt. Elor Azaria after video footage emerged showing him shooting Sharif in the head as he lay on the ground injured and already subdued.  The second Palestinian suspect had already been shot dead. The case against Azaria has divided opinion among the Israeli public politicians and members of the military and focused attention on the military?s code of ethics. The shooting came at the height of a wave of Palestinian stabbing and ramming attacks amid criticism that Israeli soldiers were too quick to pull the trigger in response often killing the assailants. Human rights organizations say Israeli soldiers rarely face discipline for violence against Palestinians. Azaria became the lightning rod for that criticism. Hundreds of supporters protested on Azaria?s behalf outside the Tel Aviv courtroom where the trial was held and senior politicians have called for him to be pardoned.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday added his voice to those in favor of a pardon. On his Facebook page Netanyahu wrote ?(T) his is a difficult and painful day    first and foremost for Elor his family many citizens and parents of soldiers among them me.? But the Israeli minister of defense said that the military would respect the verdict even if there were those who didn?t like it. Azaria was serving in Hebron a majority Palestinian area in the West Bank when he shot Sharif. The Israeli soldier who had been attacked suffered a minor injury. According to the Israel Defense Forces Azaria arrived at the scene about 11 minutes after the attack cocked his rifle and shot Sharif in the head killing him. Azaria denied the charges against him. But a   panel of military judges was unanimous in finding him guilty of manslaughter and improper conduct. Packed courtroom At the heart of the case was the motivation for the soldier?s actions. Azaria?s defense argued he felt his life was in danger while the prosecution contended he was motivated by malice and vengeance. In a lengthy explanation before the verdict was delivered the judges rejected all the defense arguments. The head judge Col. Maya Heller said that Azaria was an ?unreliable? witness and that his defense witnesses were also problematic. She called the shooting ?needless.? Azaria?s attorneys have promised to appeal the conviction.  About 50 people packed Courtroom A inside the heavily guarded Ministry of Defense as they waited for the verdict to be read.  On one side of the aisle sat Azaria?s family. On the other sat the media. Four members of the prosecution dressed in uniform waited across from Azaria?s defense team dressed in suits.  Family members gave Azaria reassuring hugs and pats on the back. His mother held him tightly. Emotional scenes followed when the verdict was finally announced. After the judges walked out Azaria?s mother screamed ?You should be ashamed of yourselves.?  Protesters chant ?Our soldier the hero?  Across the street from the Ministry of Defense compound several hundred supporters gathered behind a police security barrier.  They danced and cheered shouting ?Our soldier the hero.?  Some waved Israeli flags and homemade signs that read ?Today: Azaria Tomorrow: Your son.? Other signs said ?The nation is with you!? The IDF said in a statement that it respected the court verdict and would study its implications while giving Azaria and his family all the support they need. ?The IDF judicial system will continue to act towards revealing the truth with independence and professionalism in any case of suspected wrongdoing by the IDF and its soldiers? the statement said. But others mostly politicians on the right have argued that Azaria?s actions were justified and that he should never have faced prosecution for killing a terror suspect. Naftali Bennett the Israeli education minister and Jewish Home party leader called for an ?immediate? pardon in a post on Facebook saying the process had been ?contaminated from the start.? Miri Regev Israel?s culture and sports minister said she would ?work to pardon? the convicted soldier. ?This was a trial that should never have begun? Regev a former brigadier general and spokeswoman for the IDF wrote in a Facebook post.  ?Positive step? However human rights groups hailed the verdict. In a statement Amnesty International said the conviction was ?a rare occurrence in a country with a long record of using excessive and unwarranted force? and that it ?offers a small glimmer of hope amid the rampant impunity for unlawful killings? in the Palestinian territories. Sari Bashi Israel advocacy director at Human Rights Watch said ?Today?s conviction is a positive step toward reining in excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians.? Rights organization Adalah    the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel said the conviction was ?the exception to the rule and stands unique in the long history of impunity enjoyed by Israeli armed forces.?
271,50443,WikiLeaks? Assange: Russia didn?t give us emails,CNN,Euan McKirdy,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeated his claim that the Russian government was not the source of hacked Democratic campaign emails his organization released before the US presidential election. The Obama administration citing US intelligence sources has accused Russia of orchestrating the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an attempt to influence the election?s outcome.  The administration says it is ?100% certain? about Russian involvement but   Donald Trump has frequently cast doubt on the veracity of the claims.  In an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News? ?Hannity? Assange was asked if WikiLeaks? source of the hacked material was ?Russia or anyone associated with Russia.? ?Our source is not a state party. So the answer    for our interactions    is no? Assange told anchor Sean Hannity from his quarters at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where he has lived under diplomatic protection since 2012.  Pressed on the source of the emails leaked by WikiLeaks in the weeks and months leading up to the November election Assange repeated ?Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties.? He was not asked directly if he believed Russia orchestrated the hacking. What Trump tweets vs. What Trump means Palin: All is forgiven Reacting to the Hannity interview 2008 US vice presidential candidate and   Fox News contributor Sarah Palin once a vociferous opponent of WikiLeaks posted an apology to Assange on Facebook.  ?This important information (the emails) that finally opened people?s eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange? she wrote.  ?I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial relatively boring) emails years ago. ?Julian I apologize.? Trump weighed in on Twitter on Wednesday morning saying ?Julian Assange said ?a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta    why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!? As with Palin?s   the  ?s citation of the WikiLeaks founder represents a markedly different attitude toward the whistleblowing organization.  CNN?s KFile uncovered a 2010 interview with Trump in which Fox News anchor Brian Kilmeade brought up the topic of WikiLeaks. At the time WikiLeaks had published hundreds of thousands of classified documents and videos that were leaked to the organization by Pfc Chelsea Manning known at the time as Pfc Bradley Manning. Speaking on camera to preview Kilmeade?s radio show  Trump said: ?I think it?s disgraceful I think there should be like death penalty or something? during the quick exchange.  Assange denies contact with Putin Trump campaign Assange also denied talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin his surrogates or anyone associated with the Trump campaign.  He suggested that President Barack Obama was ?acting like a lawyer? with the hacking allegations. ?If you look at most of his statements he doesn?t say . .. WikiLeaks obtained its information from Russia worked with Russia.? He said the content of the emails that WikiLeaks published was germane to the US election and the concerns of the electorate and dominated much of the election cycle in the weeks leading up to November 8.  ?Was (the leaked information) influential? Did it have a lot of influence? Statistically yes. It was the No. 1 topic on Facebook throughout October. The No. 1 (political) topic on Twitter also throughout October.  ?Did it change the outcome? Who knows. It?s absolutely impossible to tell.? Trump says he has inside information on hacking Assange open to publishing Trump leaks if available Assange also told Hannity he would have ?absolutely? released information about Trump and his campaign if he had received it.  He added that the White House?s ?dramatic response? directly accusing Russia of orchestrating the hacks is an attempt to ?delegitimize? Trump?s presidency something he believes the defeated party will continue to do.  ?(The Democratic Party) will seize on this and harp on it for the next four years? he said.  Trump the computer and email skeptic in chief
272,50444,Chuck Schumer: Trump opposition leader,CNN,Dana Bash,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Chuck Schumer arrived for his first day as Senate Democratic leader to a large new Capitol suite still strewn with unpacked boxes. ?It?s a little fancier than I?m used to but it goes with the territory? Schumer told us as he sat down for his maiden television interview as the Senate?s top Democrat. Schumer was hoping to be the new Democratic Senate majority leader working with Hillary Clinton in the White House. Instead he is leading the Trump opposition. The former would have been more fun he conceded but he says being minority leader now is ?more important.? Here?s how he described a recent phone conversation with Donald Trump: ?I said ?Mr.   you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran you were an   change candidate. But by your Cabinet picks and your early pronouncements you seem to be embracing your timeworn   hard right?? he recalled. ?If you do that your presidency will not come close to being a success? he told Trump. For Schumer success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with Trump and when to oppose him. Schumer describes it as ?accountability.? ?The only way we?re going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues? Schumer said. Schumer: ?We?re not compromising for its own sake? ? % of the time we?ll be holding his feet to the fire holding him accountable. But we?re Democrats we?re not going to just oppose things to oppose them? he added. Schumer started his congressional career in the House in 1981 and served there until successfully defeating longtime Republican Sen. Alfonse D?Amato in 1998. He climbed the Democratic ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan Senate immigration reform in 2013 though the bill stalled in the House and never became law. Schumer loves being the center of deal making a lot like the incoming president.   ?Well here?s the problem. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have been run by a hard right group? said Schumer. Schumer: I wish we hadn?t triggered ?nuclear option? But what about now that they have a dealmaker in the White House? ?Look we?re going to look at the specifics? Schumer said. ?And on the overwhelming bunch of it particularly given who he?s chosen as his Cabinet people we?re going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.?  ?Of course I?d like to make a deal? he added. Many progressives scoff at the notion of Schumer even considering any form of compromise with Trump. Democracy for America a leading progressive group said: ?Democratic leaders from Chuck Schumer down need to stop playing footsie with Trump and pretending we can find.? Schumer?s response: ?We?re playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.?  ?If we can work with him and be true to our principles we?re not going to reject him. But overall we?re sticking to our principles? he said.  The two New Yorkers have a history. Schumer says he doesn?t know Trump well but he was one Schumer?s of early political donors. Schumer confirmed New York Post reporting that the   told him he likes him better than GOP leaders.  The new Democratic leader said he wasn?t surprised but also not flattered. ?When you get to be in my position people do tend to want to flatter you and you?ve got to take it with a grain of salt? he said. Trump is hardly Schumer?s only concern. He?s also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated Democratic Party. Schumer confirms Trump told him he likes him better than Republicans ?What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a   economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn?t have that in this election? Schumer said. ?So that even though Trump?s positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want he seemed to be the person talking to them.? The New York Democrat says he will help his party craft what he calls a ?focused and   message.? ?And here?s the good news. Some people say ?Which direction do you go in? The old Obama coalition or the new blue collar?? If we have a   economic message it unites our party. It unites Joe Manchin (a West Virginia moderate) to Bernie Sanders (a Vermont liberal) both of whom are on my leadership team? Schumer said.  ?It unites the   worker in Scranton Pennsylvania the college student paying her loans in Los Angeles the single mom in Harlem who?s on minimum wage? he said seeming to take the message for a  . It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially the New York Times) so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences. In the 1990s one of the running jokes in Washington was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between Schumer and a television camera (Schumer says it was originally former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole?s line after Schumer used his publicity prowess to push through the Brady gun law). But that?s no longer true. Over the past several years Schumer has tried to be more disciplined. He?s more likely to either be on his cell phone in the Capitol hallways or pretend to be in order to avoid talking to reporters ?In the early days the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now I have other levers of power so I?m hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about Chuck Schumer and accessibility is never going to be one of them? Schumer said with a knowing laugh. The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for   years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. George Miller. He now lives in an apartment which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his Capitol office. ?We?re going to try to find out if we can have barbeques? Schumer said with genuine excitement. After a few more minutes the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work. After all he laughed he can?t spend all his time doing press.
273,50445,Trump derides intel briefing on ?so-called? Russian hacking,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN)  Donald Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to deride the US intelligence agencies due to brief him on alleged Russian hacking of American political groups. It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies? unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an ? ?intelligence? briefing on   ?Russian hacking? ? that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time ?to build a case.? He called the alleged delay ?very strange.? Trump tweeted Wednesday ?Julian Assange said ?a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta?   why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!? Trump said last week that he would receive an intelligence briefing on the Russian breaches this week and suggested it would come early on telling reporters on New Year?s Eve that they would know more about the subject ?Tuesday or Wednesday.? But US intelligence officials disputed Trump?s tweet alleging a delay. Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week according to US officials. The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday as even Obama has yet to receive the   briefing on the Russian hacking one US official said. And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City where Trump is on Tuesday    and was perplexed about the ?delay? Trump claimed was taking place. Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing    the Presidential Daily Briefing    which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically. But it did not dive deeply into the Russian hacking. WikiLeaks? Assange: Russia didn?t give us emails US officials briefed on the matter said Clapper National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan are scheduled to attend the meeting with Trump providing him details on the Russian hacking. While Obama met with the heads of US intelligence agencies in his first weeks as   Trump has yet to do so eight weeks after he was elected which US officials said was due to Trump?s scheduling conflicts. Instead the   has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. Before the election when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the Democratic National Committee Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and ?somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.? After Obama then slapped a series of sanctions on Russia Trump issued a statement calling for the country to ?move on to bigger and better things? and then tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions. Trump continued his skepticism on New Year?s Eve telling reporters once again that it ?could be somebody else.? ?I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove? he said. He added that he also knows ?things that other people don?t know so they can?t be sure of the situation.? On Tuesday Russia again denied intervening in the US election campaign.  Reacting to a US intelligence official who told CNN the administration traced the hack to specific keyboards which featured Cyrillic characters Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: ?I don?t understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere.?  ?Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way? he added.  In December Peskov said it was ?indecent? of the US to ?groundlessly? accuse Russia of intervention in the US election campaign. 
274,50446,Why are Russian warships in Philippines?,CNN,Brad Lendon,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) Two Russian warships arrived in the Philippines this week as Moscow looks to play a bigger role in the contested South China Sea. The Russian destroyer Admiral Tributs and the sea tanker Boris Butomato arrived in Manila on Tuesday for what the Philippine Navy termed a goodwill visit. Philippine Navy public affairs officer Lued Lincuna said there would be no joint exercises in the next five days however the idea of future joint exercises is under discussion. According to a report from Russia?s   Sputnik News Russian Navy Rear Adm. Eduard Mikhailov said the Russian ships would be conducting joint exercises with Philippine forces to fight maritime piracy and terrorism. The Sputnik report termed the exercises ?an unprecedented    contact? between Russia and the Philippines. A report from the Russian website RT. com however said the ?Russian marines are expected to discuss and share tactics? with an eye toward future joint exercises. Any snap naval exercises between the two are unlikely said Carl Schuster a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command?s Joint Intelligence Center. He said the Russian Navy uses a unique signaling system which makes communication difficult with other navies when operating in the close proximity needed in exercises. ?Maneuvering naval ships in close proximity can lead to costly collisions if there is any misunderstanding about the signaled maneuver and speed? Schuster said in an email to CNN. The Philippines is a former US territory and longtime US ally whose ties with Washington have become strained since President Rodrigo Duterte took office. Duterte has said his country could look to Russia for military support including arms purchases as relations with Washington have soured. Mikhailov said Russia would look to increase involvement in the South China Sea where islands and shoals are subject to competing claims from China the Philippines Malaysia Vietnam and Brunei. But Mikailov said Russia could be involved in joint military exercises that involved not only the Philippines but also China and Malaysia according to the Sputnik report. ?Maintaining the involvement of these regional partners is crucial for ensuring the stability of the South China Sea where competing territorial claims continue to fuel geopolitical tensions? the Sputnik report said. Tensions in the area have ratcheted up in the past two years as China has reclaimed land in massive dredging operations in the Spratly Islands turning sandbars into islands equipped with airfields weapons systems ports and lighthouses. Russian ships including the Admiral Tributs staged joint   exercises with Chinese units in the South China Sea last September. China continued to highlight its South China Sea presence this week announcing that its lone aircraft carrier the Liaoning had been conducting drills involving   fighter jets and helicopters according to a report from the   Xinhua news agency. The agency?s website featured a gallery of photos from the exercises. The South China Sea are the latest in a cruise of the Liaoning that saw it venture into the open Pacific for the first time in late December. The Pacific leg of the cruise took the carrier and its escorts past Japan and Taiwan both of which took notice. ?The threat of our enemy is growing day by day. We should always be maintaining our combat alertness? said Taiwan Defense Minister Feng  . ?We are taking notice of this event which indicates China is expanding its ability to engage in maritime warfare? Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.  
275,50448,Man with knife attacks Chinese kindergarten,CNN,Steven Jiang,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Beijing (CNN) A man with a knife climbed over the wall of a kindergarten in China and attacked 11 students according to Chinese state media.  No children sustained   injuries according to police. The attack happened in the southwestern city of Pingxiang in the province of Guangxi. A    suspect has been caught but his motives remain unclear state media reported. Knife attacks at schools in China are common. Last year a man in the southern province of Hainan stabbed 10 children before killing himself authorities said.  And another man killed three students at a school in 2014 before jumping off a building. 2012: China attack illustrates U. S. gun law divide But perhaps the worst spate of stabbings occurred in 2010 which included a period of three consecutive days in which attackers targeted schools. China?s Ministry of Education responded to those events by ordering schools to beef up security and bar strangers from going on campuses. Police in Beijing distributed long poles with prongs that security guards could use to keep attackers at bay.  China also began requiring people to register with the government when buying large knives.
276,50449,If Democrats delay action on Trump nominees America suffers,CNN,,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) If acceptance is the last stage of grief Democrats have a way to go before they?ll get over this election. From the moment the blue wall crumbled and formerly safe states flipped to Donald Trump the left has had a tenuous grasp on political reality. Rather than accepting that Trump will be the President on January 20 many have instead jumped from one desperate strategy to another in an effort to overturn the will of the American voters.  It began with Jill Stein?s   recount a more than $7 million boondoggle that ended up netting more votes for the  . Some on the left then turned to an unseemly campaign  ranging from celebrity videos to threats of violence to persuade electors to ignore the voters in their states and cast their ballots for someone anyone other than Donald Trump.  With these efforts failed and Trump?s inauguration but days away Democrats have taken up a new strategy: They will cripple the American government before they?ll see Donald Trump lead it.  As reported in the Washington Post  Democratic Party leaders well aware that they lack the votes in the Senate to defeat Trump?s Cabinet choices have vowed to delay them for as long as possible saying they want to see more information from the nominees on their personal finances. If successful Democrats may prevent Trump from filling critical posts in government from secretary of state to the United States attorney general until March or beyond.  This strategy is an ?unprecedented break with Senate tradition.? Certainly Republicans and Democrats have been guilty of holding up confirmation hearings for nominees before but this tactic usually comes into play later in an administration. Both parties no matter how contentious the election and no matter how disliked the victor have refused to put the continuity of government at risk over petty partisanship. One need look no further back than 2009 for an example of this principle in action.   Before Barack Obama even stepped foot in the Oval Office Republican leaders vowed to oppose much of his agenda. But when President Obama nominated Eric Holder for attorney general Republicans gave him a vote and he was confirmed on February 2.   The Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state on January 21 the day after President Obama took the oath of office.  Republicans could have pulled any number of parliamentary tricks to delay the confirmation of two people whom they had every reason to oppose. But they didn?t and for good reason. The secretary of state and attorney general are two of the most important positions in government. The first is responsible for our nation?s foreign policy the second for upholding the rule of law.  Ensuring that the men and women nominated to fill these and other Cabinet positions are qualified is one of the Senate?s primary tasks one enshrined in the Constitution itself. And Democrats should do their job. Ask tough questions. Hold thorough hearings. And if necessary vote against the nominees.  But to delay the swift and orderly transition of government out of pure petty partisanship should be unacceptable to Democrats and Republicans alike. And that is exactly what Senate Democrats are threatening to do. Allowing the ship of state to run adrift or for the nation?s chief law enforcement agency to go without a leader is shameful but worse than that it threatens American lives both at home and abroad.  Losing is never easy and losing this election was certainly harder than most. So Democrats can be forgiven for overreacting. But some tantrums go too far. Donald Trump will be president. Nothing is going to change that fact. And if Democrats don?t realize that soon the results of the 2018 election may be even more difficult for them to swallow.

278,50451,Why four eyes are better than two,CNN,,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) In hindsight I suppose it was unsurprising and perhaps somewhat inevitable that it was Elton John who really taught me about eyeglasses.  Dylan Jones is the    of GQ and the Chairman of London Fashion Week Men?s About fifteen years ago I found myself at the house in Windsor that Elton shares with his long term partner David Furnish. I was there to supervise a cover session for British GQ and having got Elton to agree to the shoot along with an interview I wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly. Plus of course I was desperate to see their house. Now to say that the house was exquisite would be an understatement although what I really loved was being shown Elton?s wardrobe.  And along with the corridors of suits the lines of shirts the acres of shoes and    frankly    the stationary pantechnicons of stage jewelry what fascinated me most were the drawers and drawers of spectacles.  An ?extraordinary? collection of eyewear Call them glasses call them eyewear call them what you will but even then    having already divested himself of hundreds of pairs in various sales    Elton had a lot of them.  Spectacles he used for stagewear for streetwear and for wearing in makeshift photographic studies when being shot by illustrious Conde Nast men?s magazines. .. In fact having spent a good half an hour sifting through Elton?s extraordinary collection a collection made up of everything from vintage pieces to Art Deco gems via punk and glam right up to the modern day    I realized that the history of eyeglasses could be told through Elton?s career.  To analyze his visual appeal is to look at a cavalcade of glasses which have been as important to his success as conical bras say were to Madonna?s.  If you think of David Bowie you think of Ziggy Stardust?s red mullet if you think of Elvis you think of his white rhinestone jumpsuit. And if you think of Elton you no doubt think of one of the many pairs of outrageous glasses he has worn since he became famous. Evolution of spectacles  You can see glasses that Elton John might have worn in the current exhibition at the Design Museum Holon in Israel.  The exhibition follows the development of eyeglasses from several different points of view: from the unique Claude Samuel Collection dating right back to the 17th century to contemporary conceptual interpretations of eyeglasses by fifty Israeli designers highlighting the creative energy of the Israeli design scene. There is also a bit of virtual reality to bring things up to date. Unique pieces ranging from Elton John and John Lennon style eyeglasses to authentic Eskimo bone eyewear are shown alongside sketches of eyewear designs made by Claude?s father from the Pierre Cardin Fashion House. This show gives you a glimpse of what lies behind behind lens so to speak. Read: Understanding Bowie through his art Speaking as someone who has needed to wear glasses since the age of ten I know how important eyewear is.  Not only does it act as a disguise but it also has the innate ability to make you look smarter than you are dumber than you are or if need be to completely alter your personality.?  Spectacles can make you look richer they can make you look poorer and in the case of Elton John a man who has more experience in this area than anyone who has ever set foot in the eyewear section of a department store can make you look like an international superstar. Overview an exhibition that traces the design evolution of eyewear is currently on show at Design Museum Holon until April 29 2017.

280,50453,Turkey: Gunman identified in nightclub attack,CNN,Ian Lee,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Istanbul (CNN) Turkish authorities said Wednesday they have identified the gunman who killed 39 people in the New Year?s nightclub terror attack in Istanbul. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut avusoglu announced the development but did not name the suspect or provide his nationality. Authorities have also detained 20 alleged members of ISIS in connection with Sunday morning?s attack at the Reina nightclub   news agency Anadolu reported Wednesday.  Counterterrorism officers arrested the suspected militants at four addresses in the Bornova and Buca districts of the Aegean province of Izmir according to Anadolu. Eleven women were among those arrested. Anadolu said those detained are thought to have lived with the attacker in the central Anatolian city of Konya. Anadolu also reported that an array of military hardware was discovered during the raids including   equipment a sniper scope an ammunition belt and other items. Twenty children found at the addresses were taken into temporary care. Altogether at least 36 people are being held in connection with the nightclub shooting though the gunman who carried it out remains at large. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted to Twitter but CNN cannot independently verify it. The terror group boasted of carrying out the first major terrorist attack of 2017. Suspect seen in selfie video On Monday police released a video that the suspected gunman apparently took of himself in a market near the nightclub.  The ?selfie video? featuring the man in Istanbul?s Taksim Square was first posted on a   Telegram account before Turkish media broadcast it said Laith Alkhouri a director at Flashpoint an American business risk intelligence company tracking terrorist and cyber threats.  Alkhouri told CNN that such a release suggests the attacker was part of a network supportive of or linked to ISIS and that he had shared the selfie footage with the terror group before or after the attack. Growing threats On Tuesday Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told lawmakers that Turkish security forces had prevented 339 major terror incidents in 2016    80 of which came in the final three months of the year. In his speech to parliament Soylu cited attacks launched by the militant Kurdistan Workers? Party or PKK as well as those by Daesh the Arabic term for ISIS. Anadolu quoted Soylu as saying that ?313 of the incidents were planned by PKK 22 by Daesh and four by radical leftist groups.? He said that 247 improvised explosives and 61 bomb vehicles had been seized in 12 months. He also revealed the capture of 23 suicide bomber suspects as well as 42 terrorist group members who were preparing for attacks.

281,50454,New UN secretary-general starts work,CNN,,1/3/2017,2017,1,,United Nations (CNN) Antonio Guterres cheerfully walked into the United Nations on Tuesday to officially assume his position as  . But looming large over his future is a man not far away at Trump Tower in Manhattan who also starts his new job soon.     Donald Trump has criticized the UN for its failure to perform and for a Security Council vote against Israel on settlements. He even tweeted that the UN was just a place ?to talk and have a good time.? When asked if Trump?s criticism worried him Guterres responded ?No. I am concerned about all the terrible problems we face in the world all the wars that are happening everywhere.? He added ?I hope we will all be able to come together.? Trump did say the UN has ?such great potential.?  Guterres in a Snapchat interview Tuesday took note of that remark. ?That?s exactly what I feel. My job is to make sure that potential becomes a reality? he said. ?The US is a country totally committed to UN reforms and will be an important ally in the work ahead that needs to be done.? The United States is by far the largest funder of the 193 member countries of the UN providing more than 20% of the UN budget. Any   has to make sure relations are good with the White House.   This is only the second time a UN   and a US president will begin their terms within weeks of each other.    Guterres a former prime minister of Portugal has been praised by former colleagues for his negotiating skills. He served 10 years as the head of the UN?s refugee agency based in Geneva.  UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the new   wants 2017 to be a year of peace spurred by a surge in diplomacy. Guterres is a realist.  ?We are facing very challenging times? he said in    remarks to dozens of staff members gathered in the lobby citing global terrorism and refugees as two of the major problems in the world.  The   noted there?s a lot of resentment and skepticism about the UN?s role. He told staff members to be proud of their achievements but added that ?we should recognize our shortcomings and failures.? Guterres appears to be more    than his predecessor Ban   of South Korea and more relaxed. Guterres for example spoke without notes to the UN staff. Guterres concluded by telling the staff ?It?s not enough to do the right thing. We need to earn the right to do the right thing.?  
282,50455,DHS chief: Don?t use ?Dreamer? info to deport them,CNN,Evan Perez,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson is warning lawmakers that personal information collected by his agency for applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival or   Dreamers should not be used in the future to deport them.   Johnson?s veiled warning to incoming President Donald Trump and his administration could be useful in upcoming court cases if Trump revokes an executive order signed by President Barack Obama. That order signed in 2012 stops deporting young undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children so long as they meet certain requirements. ?Since DACA began thousands of Dreamers have been able to enroll in colleges and universities complete their education start businesses that help improve our economy and give back to our communities as teachers medical professionals engineers and entrepreneurs    all on the books? Johnson wrote in a letter. ?We continue to benefit as a country from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future.? Johnson said it is department precedent to only use the details of people seeking protection from deportation only for that express purpose citing how foreign victims of Hurricane Katrina or abused immigrants under the jurisdiction of the Violence Against Women Act were treated.  ?We believe these representations made by the US government upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied must continue to be honored? Johnson wrote. Politico first reported Johnson?s letter. On the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website the site states ?Information provided in this request is protected from disclosure? but also warns that policy ?may be modified.? ?This policy which may be modified superseded or rescinded at any time without notice is not intended to does not and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit substantive or procedural enforceable by law by any party in any administrative civil or criminal matter? the site states in its Frequently Asked Question?s page. Some immigration attorneys are advising their clients not to apply for DACA given the risks. Dreamers and several   mayors have asked Trump to reconsider his plan to scrap the protections. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel pressed Trump over the issue at a meeting in Trump Tower last month. Trump in recent weeks appeared to soften his tone about Dreamers telling Time magazine: ?We?re going to work something out that?s going to make people happy and proud.?
283,50456,US admin ?100% certain? about Russia hacking,CNN,Mick Krever,1/3/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) The US administration is ?is 100% certain in the role that Russia played? in   hacking State Department Spokesman John Kirby told CNN. ?There?s no question? about what Russia did to ?sow doubt and confusion and getting involved through the cyber domain into our electoral process? he told Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. ?And that?s not just an assessment by the President or by Secretary Kerry or other Cabinet officials. It?s an assessment by the entire intelligence community? he added. WATCH: Amanpour?s full interview with John Kirby   Donald Trump has raised doubts about that assessment and suggested he has inside information about who was involved. On December 15 he tweeted: And three days earlier: Kirby dismissed that notion. ?The information is there and it?s rock solid. And we obviously would not have pursued the measures that we pursued without that level of certainty? he said. ?So yes we are a 100% certain.?

284,50457,Obama tells Democrats: ?Don?t rescue? Republicans on ?Trumpcare?,CNN,MJ Lee,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama delivered a mandate to Democrats on Wednesday: ?Don?t rescue? Republicans on Obamacare. Less than three weeks out from leaving the White House Obama visited Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill with a mission to save his signature healthcare reform law as Republicans are moving quickly to unroll the Affordable Care Act. In the   meeting the President urged fellow Democrats to not ?rescue? Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures according to sources in the room.  He also floated this idea: Start referring to the GOP?s new plan as ?Trumpcare.?  The suggestion was a clear indication of the Democratic Party?s goal of turning the tables on Republicans who are already facing pressure to quickly craft a replacement bill.  As he walked by a scrum of reporters Obama would only say this about the Democratic Party?s message: ?Look out for the American people.? After the meeting a White House aide said Obama used ?Trumpcare? as an indication he was open to Trump taking credit for improvements.  The feisty remarks from the outgoing President came as Republicans also huddled on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning to chart their path forward repealing Obamacare. Vice   Mike Pence visited with GOP lawmakers in what became a morning of dueling meetings on Day Two of the new Congress. Pence told reporters following the meeting: ?Make no mistake about it: We?re going to keep our promise to the American people    we?re going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with solutions that lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.? The public theater of the simultaneous meetings Wednesday was the clearest indication in the new year that Obamacare will be an   and deeply contentious political fight under the next president Donald Trump. With Republicans about to control the House Senate and the White House Democrats are strategizing on ways to pressure the GOP against rolling back the law    and ensuring the Republicans are held responsible for any disruptions in health coverage. (Following their meeting Democratic lawmakers started to push the phrase: ?Make America Sick Again?    a play on Trump?s campaign slogan ?Make America Great Again. ?) Republicans meanwhile have the massive task of figuring out how to replace what they repeal. Republican members leaving the meeting with Pence said the gathering felt like a ?pep rally? but that there were not many policy details discussed. According to GOP Rep. Chris Collins the party is eyeing the goal of crafting a replacement proposal in six months. Pence who was a congressman before serving as Indiana?s governor recalled his time in the House and accused Democrats of breaking the promises made at the time.  ?The reality is that I was here in March of 2010 in another capacity when Obamacare was signed into law? Pence said alongside other GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan. ?I remember all those promises. We were told that if you like your doctor you can keep it. Not true.? Both Ryan and Pence promised a ?careful? replacement of the law trying to assuage concerns that a straight repeal of Obamacare would leave many including those with   conditions without healthcare.  The benefits of Obamacare was something the President emphasized in his meeting with Democrats according to Rep. Maxine Waters and argued that the country largely likes the law and that he has received countless letters thanking him for Obamacare. Another lawmaker in the room said the mood among Democrats was ?fired up.?  ?In two weeks I will no longer be a politician but I?ll still be a citizen. I envy you so much right now because I would love to be on the field? Obama said according to the member. Too partisan? Some lawmakers on Tuesday questioned the wisdom of planning clashing meetings each designed to advance a partisan agenda. ?Any type of a meeting that we have that?s not bipartisan is not in the proper scheme of things of starting out the new year? said Sen. Joe Manchin the moderate Democrat from West Virginia who said he would skip the Obama meeting. ?It?s just not a good situation for us to be in. So if Mr. Pence is coming up here only to speak to Republicans and President Obama?s coming here only to speak to Democrats I would be concerned about that. Because I don?t know how you change anything    how do you change anything unless we all come together?? Republicans have long vowed to get rid of Obamacare voting on dozens of measures that would repeal the law. Those attempts were largely theatre there was never a scenario in which Obama himself would approve the repeal of his own landmark legislative accomplishment.  Trump made getting rid of the law a key element of his campaign strategy. He said on Twitter Tuesday that Obamacare provided ?lousy healthcare.? With Trump headed for the Oval Office and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress the prospects for a successful repeal now appear more realistic. On Tuesday Senate Republicans took their first steps toward repealing Obamacare filing a budget resolution reversing key elements of the law. There remain divisions however on which precise elements of the law to scrap and how to replace Obamacare with a law that doesn?t strip Americans of their health insurance. Sen. Rand Paul   wrote in an   Tuesday that lawmakers shouldn?t vote on repealing Obamacare until a replacement plan was developed. ?If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare. For mark my words Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come? he wrote.   And Trump?s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway who?s been tapped to serve as his senior counselor at the White House said Tuesday that passing repeal and replacement measures simultaneously would be ?the ideal situation.? ?We don?t want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance? Conway said on MSNBC adding there ?are some pieces of merit in the current plan.?

286,50459,Republicans already jittery about Obamacare repeal,CNN,MJ Lee,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) Republicans are just getting started on their   dream of repealing Obamacare and already there are fears that things are moving too fast. Some Republicans are cautioning against repealing the Affordable Care Act too quickly and urging the party take the foot off the accelerator. The reason: there?s no plan on how to replace what they roll back. And while GOP lawmakers are eager to please their base with headlines of Obamacare?s repeal they don?t want to be blamed for leaving people without health insurance and chaos in the healthcare market. Sen. John McCain told reporters Tuesday that he supports taking a slower approach to repealing the law saying he is ?always worried about something that took a long time in the making and we?ve got to concentrate our efforts to making sure that we do it right so that nobody?s left out.? Newt Gingrich the former Republican House Speaker and a close ally of   Donald Trump told CNN that a big risk for Republicans is getting blamed for taking away people?s health coverage. Nightcap: Congress returns  ?   with a House GOP stumble | Sign up ?Number one thing (Republicans) have to avoid is putting themselves in a position where Democrats can frighten people    that somehow they won?t have access to health care because of Republicans? Gingrich said.   Gingrich stressed that before Republicans send a bill repealing Obamacare to Trump?s desk the party must make real progress on a replacement plan. ?They have to have bridges to give people a sense of comfort that they?re not going to be abandoned? he said.   GOP Sen. Rand Paul cited potential insurance market problems if the law isn?t replaced when it is repealed. ?If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare? he said in an   Tuesday. ?For mark my words Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come.?  These initial hints of anxiety from Republicans foreshadow an internal GOP    on Obamacare in the coming weeks. For now party leaders are leaning towards a repeal bill that includes a   or   transition period that would offer a buffer    a strategy that has been dubbed ?repeal and delay.? House and Senate Republicans both started procedural efforts Tuesday    the first day of the new session of Congress    that will lead to overhauling Obamacare.   But healthcare experts warn that even if the repeal doesn?t go into effect right away the uncertainty could lead to insurance companies fleeing the marketplace and potentially putting millions of people?s coverage at risk.    In a clear effort to counter some of the early criticism leaders of the conservative House Republican Study Committee plan to unveil legislation on Wednesday that they argue would both repeal and replace Obamacare.  The bill was previously introduced by GOP Rep. Phil Roe a physician and has not been endorsed by leadership. While it is unlikely to emerge as the main Obamacare repeal bill in the House it marks an effort by conservatives to push back on the suggestion that the party has no replacement plan.   Democrats turn the tables All of this comes as Democrats are pouncing on the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans. Lawmakers are planning a PR blitz throughout the month of January accusing Republicans for possibly putting millions of Americans? health coverage in jeopardy. Sen. Joe Manchin a moderate Democrat from West Virginia warned that repeal and delay approach would result in a ?chaotic? scene.  ?I?m just going to caution again my friends: Don?t repeal this unless there?s a bipartisan group? Manchin said. ?And if you don?t have anything to replace it with don?t put repeal on the board.?  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on a call Monday that the GOP?s ?repeal and delay? strategy amounts to ?an act of cowardice? and warned that Democrats will play no role in helping their colleagues across the aisle replace the ACA.   ?It?s the old thing of going into a china shop    you break it you own it? Pelosi said.  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Tuesday that she is in the process of crafting   on Obamacare along the lines of: ?Look at what this is going to do to people.?  ?That?s the important thing? she said. ?How many people are going to lose their healthcare??
287,50460,Bangalore police chief: ?Not a single lady was molested?,CNN,Juliet Perry,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) A newspaper report that a mob of men molested women on the streets of an Indian city on New Year?s Eve sparked controversy and concern after a government official confirmed it but the police denied that any such thing happened. It started with a report in the The Bangalore Mirror the paper saying that its photojournalists witnessed ?a brazen mass molestation of women? in the city?s central business district. The news story was picked up by other media outlets across India. Eyewitness Parikshit Murria told CNN that he saw ?a horde of men? molesting girls ?in every possible manner.?  And a state minister confirmed that females were ?harassed? in the city during the New Year celebrations    although he added fuel to the fire by apparently suggesting the women were to blame. Meanwhile the allegations were firmly denied by a police chief in Bangalore who suggested that they were concocted by journalists. ?The media is making it look like molestation was happening by blurring the faces [of people in pictures] but no such thing was happening? said Praveen Sood Bangalore?s commissioner of police. However Sood admitted there were chaotic scenes in the central business district during the    celebrations and ?panic in the crowd.? According to the Bangalore Mirror ?a mob? of ?unruly men? engaged in a ?brazen mass molestation of women? as tens of thousands of revelers gathered on December 31.  The publication said the incident was witnessed by its photojournalists.  ?All hell broke loose close to midnight as hooligans in the garb of revelers started pawing molesting and passing lewd remarks on women on the streets forcing some of them to literally take off their stilettos and run for help? it reported. On Wednesday The Bangalore Mirror said it stood by its story. ?We have spoken to two victims who were molested and nine people who were witnesses and confirmed what they saw? editor Ravi Joshi told CNN. ?I don?t know what the police mean [when they say no one was molested]. We don?t know why they?re not believing the reports? he said. ?Shocked?   software engineer Parikshit Murria told CNN he was horrified by the scene unfolding before him around 11. 30 p. m. while he was out with two friends. Murria said they saw a ?horde of people walking very fast.? They assumed there might be a ?VIP or celeb? in the group he said but soon realized there were two girls at the center of the mob. The men were ?trying to molest them in every possible manner? Murria said. ?We just got few glimpses of those girls and one of them was on ground. I don?t know what happened to them after that we were pushed further away by the crowd. We never expected this kind of atmosphere and we were completely shocked.? Murria claimed that minutes later he and his friends saw a man trying to touch one of a group of four women who were ?without any male accompany.? Murria said they scared the man off and accompanied the group to a taxi. ?I was in the front and two of my friends on the back and those girls were in between? Murria told CNN. ?I don?t even remember how many hands and people I threw away.? Some men became aggressive with him and his friends. ?A few came to fight with us and few just went away after looking into my eyes. Finally we dropped them near their cab.? Murria reported seeing numerous girls in tears some being guarded by the police. ?At some places there were shoes and slippers all over the road like some stampede has just happened.? ?One of them groped me? Chaitali Wasnik a    photographer told CNN that she was groped at a street party in the Indira Nagar area of Bangalore at around 1. 30 am on New Year?s Day. This is a different location to the other reports described by Wasnik as ?a pub hub and a posh part of Bangalore.? ?The area was brightly lit and there were thousands of people there partying on the same street. I had a friend with me but he was a little drunk so I was trying to get a cab for him. Then two men approached me from the front. I moved aside. But one of them groped me? she said. ?I was wearing a jumpsuit he slid his hand inside and groped my breast. I panicked and when I came to my senses I started to hit and scratch him. He too panicked and started telling people surrounding us that he didn?t do anything. People around me pulled me back saying ?leave it it happens.? That guy and his friend escaped.? Wasnik added: ?The guy appeared to be   years old. There were lots of policemen in the area but no one available around me when the incident happened. I cannot complain to the police because the guy ran away. I assumed they won?t be able to do anything because I have no identification. I couldn?t do anything so I just searched for a cab and went home.? ?They try to copy westerners? G Parameshwara home minister of Karnakata state confirmed that assaults happened    despite what the police told CNN. However he seemed to place blame on the alleged victims. ?They try to copy the westerners not only in their mindset but even in the dressing? he said in an interview with local press. ?So some disturbance some girls are harassed these kinds of things do happen.? Responding to the minister?s comments Himel Sakar a representative for the   women?s rights NGO Breakthrough told CNN: ?There?s a simmering sentiment among a lot of people that because women were out there celebrating New Year they were asking to be assaulted. ?It?s now that we must lead the charge for a reoccupation of our public spaces.? Parameshwara told local media that additional police and surveillance had been deployed to control and monitor the crowds and they had footage of assaults taking place. ?We will see who has done all these kinds of things and we?ll see what best we can do? he said. But this was contradicted by senior police officers who spoke to CNN. Praveen Sood Bangalore?s commissioner of police said: ?This [mass molestation] did not occur. Not a single lady was molested. We have the complete unedited video footage [from CCTV cameras] and are going to release it.? He alleged that pictures with blurred faces made it look like molestation was happening when it was not.  Sood added: ?There were tens of thousands of people gathered at MG Road and Brigade Road on New Year?s Eve. This happens every year has been happening for the last 25 years. There were 1 500 police personnel present to manage the crowd.? However he admitted that people tried to break barricades amid chaotic scenes and panic in the crowd. Meanwhile K. V. Sharath Chandra an additional commissioner of police in Bangalore told CNN: ?We are waiting for a victim to come forward and file a complaint with the police. .. but no one has come to police yet. If someone registered a case that would be fantastic.? Sexual assault frequently goes unreported in India because victims feel they will not be taken seriously or kept safe.
288,50462,Arrests end NAACP sit-in at Jeff Sessions? office,CNN,,1/3/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) An NAACP   to protest the nomination of US Sen. Jeff Sessions as US attorney general ended late Tuesday when six people were arrested at Sessions? Mobile Alabama office. The arrests of five men and one woman included NAACP President Cornell W. Brooks said Malik Russell director of communications for the civil rights group. They face charges of criminal trespass in the   according to Mobile police. The protesters arrived earlier Tuesday and said they would stay until Sessions is no longer the nominee or they were arrested. ?We are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the   Donald Trump to withdraw the nomination? Brooks said Tuesday afternoon from Sessions? office. ?In the midst of rampant voter suppression this nominee has failed to acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while pretending to believe in the myth of voter fraud.?  Earlier in the day Alabama NAACP President Benard Simelton said he and   others were there ?conducting business as usual? and would remain until ?Sessions meets our demands or the arrest    whichever he chooses.? Sessions was nominated in November. Brooks posted a photo on Twitter of himself Simelton and two other activists in the office. Sessions a former Alabama attorney general has been a controversial figure in the past. His appointment to a federal district court in 1986 by   Ronald Reagan sank when a former Justice Department employee testified that Sessions had made racist remarks. Sessions denied the allegations. Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores in a statement to CNN said the senator ?has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption.? ?Many   leaders who?ve known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next attorney general. These false portrayals of Sen. Sessions will fail as tired recycled hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited? she said.
289,50463,Preparing for the worst: How to escape Kim Jong Un,CNN,Juliet Perry,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Seoul (CNN) It?s a bitterly cold bleak day on a military base in South Korea. People are milling around calmly clutching hot coffees making small talk. Kids are chasing each other around an air hangar.  It?s hard to believe they are practicing a   emergency evacuation that simulates what would happen if North Korea invaded.  ?In real life everyone would be wearing masks rushing through places? says mom of two Nicholle Martinez. ?There would be chaos everywhere. It would be scarier.?  Nicholle met Nick Martinez when they were both stationed with the US military in Seoul. They?ve now been married for nine years and have two beautiful energetic and charismatic children. Briannah 6 is in first grade and Alannah 8 is in third.  In many respects they?re very typical. They go to church on Sundays and have lunch together afterward. They like to play sports    mom and dad want the girls to grow into healthy strong young ladies.  Briannah wants to be a teacher Alannah wants to be president. But because the whole family is now living on post in Seoul the Martinez family lives with the   danger of a very noisy and unpredictable neighbor    Kim Jong Un. In the face of escalating tension the Martinez women are practicing their path to safety. In a   exercise they traveled by bus helicopter and military plane from South Korea all the way to the Pacific island of Okinawa Japan.  In a CNN exclusive we went along with them for the ride. All those taking part in the drill are volunteers    relations of US soldiers stationed in Seoul. Unlike in a real scenario they?ve had the opportunity to plan a little for this event.  There are a number of reasons why an order like this could be enacted says Justin Sturn a   evacuation planner. He uses the 2011 earthquake in Japan or the recent evacuation of   from Turkey as examples.  However for all the claims this is a routine practice run Kim?s threats loom over the exercise. In September North Korea said it had hit the button on its fifth and potentially most powerful nuclear test. International condemnation and aggressive sanctions have done little to impede the regime?s nuclear ambitions.  In a New Year?s address Kim said that his country is close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile.  ?He?s said publicly that we?re the enemy? says Sturn.  ?With all the rhetoric that comes out of North Korea of course we have to prepare for the worst case scenario.? Military families stationed in South Korea are encouraged to have a bag ready to go at all times. ?I have a duffel bag that is always packed with sleeping bags and canned food? says Nicholle. According to Sturn the decision to get soldiers? families out of the country would come right from the top.  A   evacuation order (NEO) is a political decision not a military one. ?We would conduct the mission but the execution is still a Department of State decision? says Sturn. The Army is trying to make the environment as realistic as possible.  Family members are permitted to bring along 60 pounds of personal stuff each. Military representatives urge the group to only bring the bare essentials. I ask the Martinez family what went into their bags first. ?My cellphone!? says Nicholle in a heartbeat.  ?My blanket? says   old Alannah. She wraps her comfort around herself like a cape. Briannah pauses shyly. Mom and sister exclaim they know exactly what went into her rucksack first. The    takes a moment to rummage in her bag and produces her   item with a flourish    a military issue doll given to the girls when Nick went on his first tour.  ?Daddy doll!? The girls are carrying their   items but one lesson Nicholle says she?s already learned from the exercise is to pack a little lighter. Although she?s a strong fitness instructor she?s weighed down with over 150 pounds of luggage and it?s slowing her down.  A string of tents is pitched at Yongsan Garrison military base. There?s an icy wind and a trace of nervous anticipation in the air as families slowly gather.  This is the first time since 2010 the evacuation simulation has gone all the way to Okinawa. Most people aren?t really sure what to expect    they?ve just been told ?it?s not going to be comfortable.? The group are issued with identity bracelets that will track their progress from South Korea to Okinawa. If this were a genuine evacuation the families would then be flown back to the United States from Japan.  There is a security screening and the opportunity to register any pets traveling. The Martinez family joke that the fish didn?t make the cut. One stage of the registration process also includes instructions on the ICAPS mask    or Infant Chemical Agent Protective System    that protects against the effects of biological attacks for up to 12 hours.  There?s a lot of nervous laughter and ?Ghostbusters? references abound. Briannah gets into the spirit of things.  But for all the smiles and calm instruction the vision of a 6   preparing for a chemical or biological attack isn?t a comfortable one. Nicholle who herself was in the military police says that as well as being a great life experience it?s a good opportunity for the girls to get some insight into what dad does for a living. ?They only have five more years until dad retires? she says. ?So being here has opened their eyes as to what military life is.?  Alannah is already showing signs of logistical aptitude. She tells me she?s not sure why they?d take so many steps to evacuate the country if it really was an emergency. I suggest it might seem easier just to get families onto a commercial flight in Seoul.  ?That?s what I would do!? she says. ?Just get outta there.?  I put Alannah?s question to Sturn who says the movement south would be in response to hostile maneuverings from the north and the ?need to move people out of that hotspot.? ?If it was a natural disaster or something like that we would absolutely fly them out of Seoul? says Sturn. ?But this is the   scenario. And the   scenario is North Korea is coming across the border and we need to get people out of harm?s way.? After about an hour?s drive in convoy from the registration point in Seoul we arrive at Camp Humphreys further south in Pyeongtaek. We?re taken through a hangar full of military hardware towards two US Army   or Chinook helicopters sitting on the tarmac.  We?re given a safety orientation issued earplugs and escorted on to the machine.  This is the first time most of the civilians have flown in a military helicopter. The roar heat and pure force from the blades is overwhelming as we get on board.  If they had to evacuate by helicopter this is a fair enactment of how it would go says Col. Lance Calvert commander of the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade. However with the increased numbers a   scenario would entail he says there would be more practical ways to transport people out of Pyeongtaek. It?s estimated that    if this were a genuine evacuation of   from South Korea    the order could be for tens of thousands of civilians to leave over a period of five to seven days. ?Trains buses or commercial transportation systems are much more efficient? he says.  The aim of the drill isn?t only to try to give relatives a realistic practice run. The military also considers the ?mental aptitude? of a soldier in a crisis and believes exercising this process builds confidence. It shows acting service members that in a dangerous situation their family members would be cared for.  ?In a natural disaster or hostile scenario the last thing you want is your soldier thinking about his family?? says Capt. Jimmy Sheehan. The helicopters land in Daegu. After a mess dinner we spend a chilly night in the dormitories on the US military base Camp Walker. The next morning we?re up at 5 a. m.  Despite the intensity and length of the journey so far all the kids in the group are still in good spirits. A trip to Okinawa aquarium is nearly within grasp.  A convoy through the spectacular mountainous south takes us to Gimhae Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) base where we?re escorted on to a US Air Force   Hercules transport plane for the drill?s final leg    onwards to Japan.  The Hercules is an impressive beast and the ? ? run into it in anticipation of arriving in warmer southern climes.  Earplugs at the ready we?re strapped in. Most of the children curl up and nod off    an oddly peaceful scene in such a stark environment.  Landing in Japan is the highlight for the Martinez girls who tell me with great enthusiasm how much they like exploring new places.   ?For some reason I thought we were going to go on a secret subway tunnel!? says Alannah. Her younger sister interjects wistfully: ?I wish we could go through a tunnel to a magical place.?  ?Just close your eyes and imagine it? laughs mom.  She says they seize these kinds of opportunities because as a military family that?s often on the move they try to make the best of it everywhere they go.  ?You adapt and you will succeed or you will be miserable if you don?t? she says. ?We embrace these kinds of events because we help our spouses. My husband benefits from us enjoying our time here. If we?re happy he?s happy.? For Nicholle the experience has also made her reflect on how an emergency evacuation would really feel. The idea of leaving all the material things behind isn?t difficult. ?The most important thing is that I get my girls to a safe place?? she says.  But it has driven home what for her would be the most painful part of the process. ?Knowing that I would be leaving my husband behind. .. that would be the hardest thing.?
290,50464,Africa?s new biofuel literally grows on trees,CNN,,12/28/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) The history of biofuel production in Africa is marked with expensive and damaging failures.  The   jatropha crop saw millions of dollars and vast tracts of land squandered while the production of palm oil has been widely criticized for association with environmental damage and human rights abuses.  But there is a new hope for the field. The Croton megalocarpus tree is common throughout much of East and Central Africa and until now it has been used for little more than firewood.   The nuts of the tree have been shown to contain high concentrations of oil and protein and they are now being used to produce a fuel that could serve as a clean alternative to diesel.  With an abundant supply of croton nuts available at minimal cost a new industry is emerging with   ambitions.    fruit In 2012 serial entrepreneur Alan Paul established Eco Fuels Kenya (EFK) to explore the potential of croton following early research that suggested promise. His company is now the driving the movement to bring croton biofuel to the mainstream.   The business took a   approach at first in contrast to   flops such as jatropha.   ?(Paul) said we can grow organically by sourcing what is already there from one of the most common trees? says EFK Managing Director Myles Katz. ?We can buy nuts from farmers so they get an income and we have a business model that does not require $10 million of funding and a big plantation to get off the ground.? EFK put out radio ads to attract local entrepreneurs into partnerships who assembled teams of smallholders to supply the nuts. When suppliers realized their previously useless trees had become an easy and reliable source of income the network rapidly expanded.   This has enabled EFK to double production each year says Katz up to 1 000 tons of nuts this year from 500 tons in 2015. The company is now in a position to scale up the operation without having planted a single tree.  New products Producing croton nut oil is a     process compared with traditional fuel manufacturing.  ?It is comparable to any other nut or oil pressing facility? says Katz. ?We modify the equipment to work on croton nuts but essentially we are buying machines used with walnuts or macadamia nuts.? Much of the fuel is sold to local businesses that run generators such as tourist camps. The company has also branched into selling   of the nuts including seedcake from the pressed nut as poultry feed and organic fertilizer from the shells. This offers insurance at a time investors remain wary of biofuels says Katz.  ?The ?unknown? (element) is hard for investors? he says. ?We are not an   business and we can stand on different parts of the business at different times.? Grand plans local roots  Having local networks of suppliers and agents is key to the EFK business model and a critical challenge for the company is to maintain these networks while expanding across the country and beyond.  ?We have a completely local approach? says Katz. ?Everything we source process and sell should be within 100 kilometers of the factory.? The company plans to maintain this approach while creating up to five new factories in Kenya and several more in neighboring countries such as Tanzania in the coming years.  EFK is also planning a first foray into an ?orchard model? of planting its own trees on a   plot in 2017 that will allow the company to test and push the limits of croton capacity.  ?There is an interesting topic of crop efficiency? says Katz. ?An indigenous tree with access to normal rainfall might produce 100 kilograms of nuts a year. But the optimum trees will produce over 300 kilograms. ..The ?orchard model? can change outcomes dramatically.?  Ripe for success Croton can succeed where other biofuels have failed according to Dr. Gerald Kafuku principal research officer of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology who has published several papers on the properties of croton oil.  ?I can say that croton is one of the most promising sources of biofuel? he says. ?It can give advantages in the form of biodiesel or straight oil and as a ?carbon sink? for afforestation.?   Kafuku believes that only a lack of funding for research and development is holding croton back from the mainstream. He adds that the region urgently needs such solutions.  ?East Africa is among the areas where there is significant environmental degradation? he says. ?New biofuels such as croton can add to the alternative sources of renewable energy as well as providing for more planting of trees.? Croton can also avoid the ethical pitfalls of other biofuels by benefiting local communities according to Rodrigo Ciannella head of the biofuels program at the World Agroforestry Centre.  ?(Croton) is providing value from a natural resource that is already abundant in the country and is largely wasted? he says. ?Farmers are already benefiting from receiving additional income. ..and they could get even more by having access to other components of the value chain such as fertilizer.? With global demand for biofuels set to increase steadily Katz believes it is a matter of time before oil giants enter the croton market and the nut becomes a major industry that can rival fossil fuels.  ?I like to tell people that croton will be a coffee or tea type of value chain? he says. ?There will be lots of competitors and regional processing all over East Africa.? 
291,50465,Will black college band perform at Trump inauguration?,CNN,,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Talladega Alabama (CNN) The president of a historically black college in Alabama has yet to decide whether the school?s marching band will perform at   Donald Trump?s inaugural parade a college spokeswoman said Wednesday. The Talladega College Marching Tornadoes band was among 40 organizations that accepted an invitation to take part in the inaugural parade after the January 20 swearing in according to an initial list released Friday by Trump?s inaugural committee.  The possibility that the band from the    college founded by former slaves in the small town of Talladega could perform sparked controversy    and resulted in two dueling petitions. College President Billy C. Hawkins has the petitions    one organized by a current student in favor of performing and the other by a Talladega graduate against taking part    CNN affiliate WVTM reported. Hawkins was expected to announce his decision Wednesday school spokesman Greg Wilson told CNN. But another school official spokeswoman Veronica   told CNN late Wednesday that any decision was unlikely to be announced during the evening.   said Hawkins had been meeting with board members all day but no decision had been reached. Hawkins was scheduled to appear Wednesday on ?CNN Tonight? with Don Lemon but canceled the appearance.  Appearance of supporting Trump A petition started by Shirley Ferrill a 1974 graduate calls on the band to ?withdraw from any inaugural events for Donald Trump.?  ?In view of his behavior and comments I strongly do not want Talladega College to give the appearance of supporting him? she wrote. The petition had more than 900 supporters by Tuesday night.  Trump has made what many view as disparaging comments about people of color including saying that Mexico was sending its worst citizens over the border.  ?Some are good and some are rapists and some are killers. We don?t even know what we?re getting? he said in 2015. Trump has also used the word ?ghettos? referring to the inner cities when he described issues faced by   in the starkest terms. ?The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We?re going to work with the   community and we?re going to solve the problem of the inner city? he said in 2016. ?We?re going to bring safety back. You can?t walk out on the street you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot.? About ?the experience? students will get In the second petition Talladega student and band member Dollan Young wrote: ?We believe that this parade is not about politics it?s about seeing first hand the process of a transition.? Young wrote that taking part in the inaugural would not be in support of a political party but rather ?about the experience that the students will obtain.?  His petition had garnered close to 200 signatures by Tuesday night.  Another band member Shylexis Robinson told CNN affiliate WVTM she was excited and felt the performance would ?put our school on the map.?  Robinson said it wasn?t ?about Donald Trump himself it?s about our school. And I?m all about our school and all about the band.?  Performance wouldn?t ?uplift? Talladega Edna Garrett of Talladega told WVTM that being associated with Trump and negativity surrounding him wouldn?t benefit Talladega. ?I don?t really see how it would uplift the school in any way? she said. Talladega College founded in 1867 is Alabama?s oldest private historically black liberal arts college according to the school?s website. It?s band though is relatively young. Wilson said the   band started in 2012 and recently performed in New Orleans at the halftime show for a National Football League game between the New Orleans Saints and the Denver Broncos. One artist invited to perform at Trump?s festivities has said she would do so    with one requirement. This week Rebecca Ferguson a former   on the British version of ?X Factor? said on Twitter she had been invited and would take part if she could perform ?Strange Fruit.?  The song protested racism and addressed lynching in the South. It was made famous by the late Billie Holiday a renowned jazz musician. In a statement posted to Ferguson?s Twitter account Monday night she said the song ?has huge historical importance a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial.  A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X.? The lyrics written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol were composed as a protest poem to highlight racism in America?s southern states. The song?s opening lyrics are: ?Southern trees bear strange fruit   Blood on the leaves and blood at the root   bodies swinging in the southern breeze   Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.? Controversy among announced performers The inaugural committee has announced three acts so far: the Radio City Rockettes the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and    ?America?s Got Talent? star Jackie Evancho. But there still is controversy surrounding the group of committed performers. A member of the Mormon choir which has performed at five presidential inaugurations quit. Jan Chamberlin said the performance would betray her values. Last month the Madison Square Garden Company said in a statement that individual Rockettes wouldn?t be compelled to participate at the inauguration after one dancer in the group Phoebe Pearl reportedly protested on Instagram.  Her post has since been deleted. In November Sir Elton John refused an invitation to perform at the inauguration    denying a claim made by the   of Trump?s presidential inaugural committee that the singer was slated to perform.  Trump has tweeted that he wants ?the PEOPLE? at his inauguration rather than   celebrities.  Barack Obama?s 2009 inauguration featured artists such as Beyonce Aretha Franklin James Taylor Brad Paisley and Alicia Keys.
292,50466,Cars hotels and cities -- made out of ice,CNN,,12/15/2016,2016,12,, (CNN) From the Canadian Prairies to the lakes of Siberia artists around the world are using an unconventional material    ice    in creative ways. Some like American artists Jim Denevan and Sean Yoro produce their works outdoors.  Denevan creates geometric patterns on surfaces across the world. In 2010 he traced   circles onto the frozen Lake Baikal in Siberia. Yoro on other hand used ice to send a message.  Yoro recently painted haunting images of faces directly onto melting ice floes in Iceland and Canada to raise awareness about climate change. Others have used ice to show innovation.  This year British artist Anish Kapoor was invited to design a warming hut in Winnipeg Canada for an art and architecture competition. The hut?s design is composed entirely out of blocks of ice. See more incredible works of art created from ice in the gallery above.
293,50469,China issues first-ever red alert for fog ,CNN,,1/3/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) As if recent red alerts for smog weren?t bad enough China has now issued its   red alert for fog to go along with them. China?s national observatory issued the fog alert Tuesday in a number of northern and eastern regions. That followed some 24 cities issuing red alerts for air pollution. Red is the most serious level in the country?s warning system. Through Wednesday thick fog in parts of the    region will reduce visibility to less than 500 meters (about 547 yards) as well as in the provinces of Henan Shandong Anhui and Jiangsu the National Meteorological Center said. In extreme cases visibility may fall below 50 meters (55 meters) in those regions. The center also renewed an orange alert for smog in the same period in northern eastern and central China with smog continuing to blanket the regions since Friday. By Wednesday the fog alert in Beijing had been downgraded to yellow though the city issued a red alert for smog according to the Beijing Meteorological Service.
294,50470,The hardest New Year?s resolution to keep,CNN,,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) It?s that time of year when many of us take a cold hard look at our lives    and more important our vices    to set a goal we believe will make us healthier or happier in the year ahead. There are 1 billion smokers worldwide and one resolution in the top 10 each year is the intention to kick the habit for good. But this goal is the most difficult of all resolutions to keep with three in five people in the United Kingdom who resolved to quit taking the habit up again by the end of January according to new data released by the Royal Society of Public Health in the UK. Of more than 2 000 people surveyed about their resolutions at the end of 2016 by research consultancy Populus 175 (8%) had chosen to quit smoking but only 41% of those 175 kept it going until January 31. Just 13% remained   at the end of the year. ?One of the main challenges of smoking is that it?s a chemical addiction? said Duncan Stephenson director of external affairs at the Royal Society of Public Health. Quitting ?takes huge amounts of willpower.? Stephenson was unsurprised by the findings. They?re an important reminder that people should not to give up after the first hurdle or  . They can use support services or quitting aids such as nicotine replacement therapy or   to improve their chances of success he said. ?Rather than setting unrealistic goals and making huge changes to lifestyle we suggest people make small changes using a   approach? he said. ?During the new year lots of people want to reinvent themselves . .. but people shouldn?t set themselves up to fail.?  Stephenson likened quitting smoking to the challenge of going on a diet in which people set unrealistic targets by making dramatic    and often      changes. ?Christmas is one of the most calorific periods of the year and then you put yourself in a straitjacket when you go on a crash diet? he said. ?In most cases 95% of diets fail.? In the organization?s survey dieting was second from last in terms of resolution success with 65% of people lasting one month and just 16% making it to the end of the year.  ?The most difficult resolutions to keep were the consumptive addictive behaviors such as smoking and dieting? said John Norcross distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Scranton and author of the behavior change book ?Changeology.? Norcross has been exploring resolutions and the factors impacting people?s ability to change for more almost 30 years. ?The easiest ones are the realistic attainable resolutions that can be accomplished permanently in the first three or four weeks? he said. Be realistic The most successful resolutions in 2016 were among people who had chosen to improve relationships with friends and family followed by shaping a healthier   balance. More than 80% of people who resolved to improve relationships reported doing so by the end of January with 58% having stuck with it to the end of the year. A better   balance came in second with 75% keeping this resolution for one month and 43% still feeling they were doing this at the end of the year. ?It?s not so much the topic it?s how realistic the goal is? Norcross said adding that for the most successful resolution ?it doesn?t say ?fix? it says ?improve? . .. so they will have a much higher success rate.? The fact that people   their success inevitably brings some bias to the findings in addition to the fact that people had to recall things from earlier in the year said Norcross.  But also worth noting is the broadness of the data. ?We don?t know how people characterize their success rates. . .. We don?t have a sense of magnitude for improvement? said Norcross giving the example of playing sports and not knowing whether people played once a week or every few months.  For its next survey Stephenson said the Royal Society of Public Health will be asking participants for more detail and will inquire further about what threw people off their resolutions. Global similarities These findings are likely to be reflected in other countries including the United States Stephenson said underscoring ?some of the challenges individuals face in both changing behavior and maintaining? their resolutions. A 2017 Marist Institute of Public Opinion resolution poll of more than 400 people in the United States found smoking to be the seventh most popular resolution chosen by 6% of those polled. The most common resolution was wanting to be a better person (16%) followed by wanting to lose weight.   In earlier studies by Norcross in 2002 the most popular resolutions still related to stopping smoking weight loss and increasing exercise. Tips for success To prepare your mind to succeed in maintaining your resolution Norcross uses the analogy of learning a new sport or skill. A person doing that is likely to slip up and make mistakes    but they should then learn from those  .  ?Let?s say you wanted to learn tennis? he said. ?People say they would have to take lessons it would take some time and they are likely to make mistakes and that?s right.? The same is true when quitting smoking or committing to eating healthier foods.  Successful people know that a slip is not a fall he said and relapses are common    and expected. ?It?s like someone missing a shot in tennis and not playing again. It?s really quite silly when you think about it? he said. But people should be encouraged by the survey numbers Norcross said adding that averaging across all resolutions about 40% of people remain successful at six months. Once there they are more likely to last the year. Both Norcross and Stephenson stress that willpower is not enough not matter how much you may hear otherwise. ?In our studies people who primarily relied on willpower failed at three times the rate of everyone else? Norcross said adding that many steps are needed to make a resolution last. ?It starts with getting prepared rewarding yourself developing a flourishing environment that supports you and creating the behavior.? Stephenson agrees adding that people should ?not be discouraged if they relapse? he said. ?It is difficult to maintain behavior change but if you make small changes it can have a huge effect.?
295,50471,A low moment in sports broadcasting  ,CNN,,1/4/2017,2017,1,, (CNN) At the beginning of this college football season I reached into a dark corner of my closet and pulled out my favorite Penn State sweatshirt.  It was time I told myself to go back to being the proud alum and former cheerleader I was before convicted child rapist Jerry Sandusky and disgraced head coach Joe Paterno who helped cover up the scandal brought shame to my university and made me vow to never again cheer: ?We Are . .. Penn State.?  This season watching my   Nittany Lions claw their way back to the top of the college ranks and ending up at the Rose Bowl made me proud. No matter that they lost   to USC which scored a heartbreaking   field goal. It was still a huge win for this   program and the new coaches and players who could only be considered innocent victims in a sick story. For one day out in the glorious California sun watching those boys play the game I love with grace and grit I felt like Penn State had finally won back some respect. But it would be dishonest of me to say all is forgiven or forgotten. I remain a hesitant college football fan and have no illusions about the corruption that   football programs can bring to a campus especially regarding issues of domestic violence and abuse perpetrated by players or coaches. On the same day that the Nittany Lions were playing in the Rose Bowl Oklahoma running back Joe Mixon took the field as his team faced Auburn in the Sugar Bowl. Mixon was embroiled in a scandal in December after a video released early last month from the 2014 incident shows him punching a woman in the face fracturing bones. Instead of addressing the controversy surrounding Mixon ESPN announcer Brent Musburger decided to dismiss it. His insulting sidestep of the domestic abuse case was a low moment in football broadcasting    and unfortunately not the first one for Musburger who seems to have a problem talking football and respecting women at the same time.  ?It was troubling very troubling to see. We?ve talked to the coaches. They all swear that the young man is doing fine. Like I said Oklahoma thought he might even transfer but he sat out the suspension reinstated and folks he?s just one of the best and let?s hope given a second chance by Bob Stoops and Oklahoma let?s hope that this young man makes the most of his chance and goes on to have a career in the National Football League? gushed Musburger briefly mentioning Mixon?s suspension (for the entire 2014 season) over the incident for which Mixon pleaded guilty to assault. (Oklahoma won the Sugar Bowl  .) I?m all for second chances. But I am never all for men who ignore and excuse violence against women under any circumstances. And that?s just what Musburger did going so far as to reiterate his position after fans watching the game expressed their surprise and disapproval on Twitter: ??You know Jess apparently some people were upset when I wished this young man well at the next level. Let me make something perfectly clear. What he did with that young lady was brutal uncalled for. He?s apologized. He was tearful. He got a second chance. He got a second chance from Bob Stoops. I happen to pull for people with second chances OK. Let me make it absolutely clear that I hope he has a wonderful career and he teaches people with that brutal violent video OK? ??  Musburger?s angry defensive rant after fans across social media who justifiably criticized his lackluster reporting of the facts in the Mixon case was unprofessional   and wrong. As a woman who worked in sports for 15 years I know it?s not easy to report on these stories. Athletes coaches and media spend more time on the road together that they do with their own families most times. And whether they admit it or not many have conflicts of interest when it comes to reporting on the ugly side of sports. You don?t have to be a woman to grasp the seriousness of domestic abuse or to believe that each of these stories can be a teaching moment for our men women and children. In fact many of those who expressed their outrage at Musburger?s comments on social media were men. The fact is that the Musburgers of the world prolong the gender stereotypes that continue to thrive in the sports industry and prevent some of the most talented women in sports from rising to the broadcast booth or the   making positions. At some point that will begin to hurt your TV ratings and your money in a sport where 55% of women are watching.  The sooner we get men like Musburger    bumbling at best dangerously sexist at worst    out of the broadcast booth the better for sports all around. Then just maybe we can promote some of those football savvy women who?ve been forever relegated to the sidelines into that booth. I guarantee we would not be discussing sexist rants by announcers ever again. Now that would be a refreshing  .
296,50472,House Transportation chair: No infrastructure package in first 100 days,CNN,Rene Marsh,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Washington (CNN) The House Transportation Committee chairman said Wednesday there will be no infrastructure package in the first 100 days of Donald Trump?s presidency breaking from a campaign pledge that Trump made repeatedly last year.  A massive infrastructure initiative was a big talking point for the   but Rep. Bill Shuster   said not to expect plan details any time soon. Right now he says the focus will be figuring out how to pay for the   price tag. ?We?re going to start to work on it but first of all you?ve got to figure out the pay for it which will come I believe in the first 100 days. Then in the next second 100 days is when we?ll put together a big infrastructure package? he said. Shuster?s comments were first reported by The Hill. Trump often said he?d push for a $1 trillion plan to rebuild America?s infrastructure over a   period though he provided little details on what that plan would look like. However in a speech he gave in October outlining his ?First 100 Days? agenda Trump listed it as a priority and his campaign outlined it as his No. 3 legislative priority calling it the ?American Energy  Infrastructure Act.? The measure would aim to leverage   partnership and private investments through tax incentives according to the campaign at the time. Trump also vowed to nix financial commitments to the United Nations for climate change programs and spend that money on water and environmental infrastructure instead.
297,50473,CNN 10 - January 5 2017,CNN,,1/4/2017,2017,1,,January 5 2017 Welcome to our very first production of CNN 10! Our international coverage explains the latest rift between the U. S. and Russia as well as the reasons for tensions between the U. S. and Israel. After 10 seconds of trivia we?re showing you what it?s like to be a freshman in the new Congress and after a report on the social media ?filter bubble? we?re showing you a walking robot that?s truly 10 out of 10. On this page you will find today?s show Transcript. TRANSCRIPT CARL AZUZ CNN TEN ANCHOR:  We are thrilled to bring you are our first ever  production of CNN TEN a new   program that explains global news to  our global audience.  My name is Carl Azuz. And we are starting today by explaining the latest rift in the strain  relations between the U. S. and Russia. For months the Obama administration has accused Russia of interfering in  last year`s U. S. presidential election.  More recently it said Russia did  this to help incoming President Donald Trump get elected.   So over the holidays the U. S. government sanctioned it penalized some  Russian intelligence services some officers that work for them and three  companies that helped support Russian intelligence.  America also closed  two Russian compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the U. S. So how did Russia respond?  Its president Vladimir Putin has repeatedly  denied interfering in the American election.  He said he would not quote  ?stoop to the level of irresponsible diplomacy? that he`d allow American  diplomats to stay in Russia and that he`d be working to rebuild relations  with the U. S. after   Trump is inaugurated. A lot of different perspectives on all this.  The head of WikiLeaks which  published millions of hacked U. S. documents said they did not come from  the Russian government.  Critics including   Trump have  said there`s not enough proof the Russian government was behind the hacks.   U. S. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the U. S. sanctions on Russia overdue  but said they were an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy  with Russia.  And Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said the  sanctions don`t punish Russia enough. There`s also trouble in the relationship between the U. S. and Israel an  American ally in the Middle East.  On December 23rd the United Nations  Security Council passed a resolution.  It says that Israel is breaking the  law by building settlements on land it captured and claimed as its own  during a war in 1967.   The U. S. usually vetoes resolutions like this because it sees them as  overly critical of Israel.  But in this case the U. S. abstained.  It  didn`t vote.  That allowed the U. N. resolution to pass when 14 other  members of the council voted for it. The resolution itself is mostly symbolic.  It doesn`t penalized  international trade or cooperation with Israel.  But it makes a statement  that infuriated Israel which has accuses the Obama administration of  secretly supporting the resolution.  The U. S. government denies but all  this has deepened the divide between America and Israel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER CNN CORRESPONDENT:  As a rule settlements are    communities that are on Israel occupied land that the Palestinians had  hoped to use as a future state.  And one of the sticking points here is  that the Palestinians feel like their land as been stolen and also that it  stops them from having a contiguous or continuous area to call their own  state.   The Israelis say ?Look some of this land is historically ours.  Some of  this land is politically ours.?  And also they`re using some of the land  for security purposes. All in all this is one of the sticking points in the process and one of  the things that Secretary Kerry has tried to undo.  But now the gloves are  off.  Because of this U. N. resolution in particular the Security Council  resolution 2334 you are seeing the reaction from Israel especially Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was furious over this resolution and  basically slapped Israel`s hand and said that they are breaking  international law by putting those settlements in place. And then we heard from Secretary John Kerry who talked about the fact that  he believes that this is a real sticking point a real problem in trying to  go forward in a peace process. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ ( ):    trivia.  What part of the U. S. Constitution  says congressional terms start on January 3rd?  Article IV the 14th  Amendment or the 20th Amendment? It`s the 20th Amendment that sets January 3rd as Congress` start date  unless the Congress changes the date by law. (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ:  And it was the 115th U. S. Congress that was sworn in on Tuesday.   Of the   Senate 52 are Republicans 48 are Democrats that  includes two independents who vote with the Democrats.   Of the 435 voting members of the House of Representatives 241 are  Republicans 194 are Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PAUL RYAN ( ) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do you solemnly swear that  you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against  all enemies foreign and domestic that you will bear true faith and  allegiance to the same that you take this obligation freely without any  mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that you will well and  faithfully discharge the duties of the office in which you are about to  enter so help you God? MEMBER OF THE U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  I do. RYAN:  Congratulations.  You are all now members of the 115th Congress. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP) AZUZ:  That`s what`s like to be sworn in to Congress.   Now for a look at what it`s like to be there for the first time.  There are  seven freshmen senators this term and 55 freshmen representatives.  Here  are two of them along with their mutual hopes to work together. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JACK BERGMAN (R) MICHIGAN:  I am Jack Bergman and I am the new  freshman congressman from the first district of Michigan.   REP. VAL BUTLER DEMINGS (D) FLORIDA:  I am Val Butler Demings  representing Florida`s 10th congressional district from Orlando.  And I am  a new member of Congress. SUBTITLE:  One Republican one Democrat one mission. There are 54 new ?freshmen? members of the House who started work on  January 3rd. The two are also   presidents.  Val Demings is a retired police  chief and Jack Bergman a retired lieutenant general in the Marine Corps. BERGMAN:  People like us are sitting here today in these new freshmen  congressmen roles because the people who vote said they want to see  something happen different than what has been happening here in  Washington D. C. in the recent past.  I believe that`s why folks like Val  and I got elected. DEMINGS:  Many times we only focus on our differences and not our  similarities.  And I believe it was a major moment for us to begin there  not leading with our party.  I didn`t go through what I went through the  last two years and did put my family through it to get here and do nothing.   The only way we`re going to be able to get some things done is to work  together. BERGMAN:  Together that`s how the Founding Fathers imagined it and that`s  how it needs to be. We`re only going to be a freshman once and if we don`t take advantage as a  freshmen class Dems and Republicans to begin to make our mark in this  115th Congress then we have missed an opportunity. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  Strictly defined an echo chamber is a room where the walls reflect  sound giving it echoing sound effects.  Figuratively defined it`s when  someone surrounds himself with ideas like his own and doesn`t get other  perspectives on a specific idea or issue.   This is what a lot of people have set up for themselves on social media  though some may not even know it or have intended to create their own echo  chamber. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REPORTER:  It`s human nature.  We surround ourselves with people we agree  with and the Internet has only made it easier.   For many Twitter is the place to have existing views reinforced.  Often  without realizing it a lot of us chose to live in an echo chamber a place  where it can seem like everyone on earth is just like us. And Facebook well Facebook takes it even further.  Of course you can  hide those posts from the group you`re on but Facebook actually does a lot  of that work for you behind the scenes.  It knows what you like and what  you comment on what brands you follow what ads grabbed your attention  events you`re attending and publications you read.  Facebook uses all that  data to feed its algorithms.  And those algorithms choose what you see.  And if you know where to look you can actually see what Facebook thinks  you like your interest your hobbies and even your political views.  The  result is what`s become known as the filter bubble where your timeline is  filled with opinions you share. Facebook actually makes money off knowing those things.  They sell you and  your filtered bubble to advertisers.  Those advertisers will pay more to  get their products in front of people that are likely to buy them.  And if  you`re seeing things you like you`ll spend more time on Facebook seeing  more ads and making the company more money. But does the bubble keep us  ?  It`s a tough question to  answer especially while the technology is still changing so fast.  But one  thing is for sure that technology has the power to make us more connected  or more isolated than ever. (END VIDEOTAPE) AZUZ:  Now for ?10 out of 10?.  Our last minute today goes to a robot  designed by a man who worked on movies like ?Transformers?.  You can pretty  much see that in the   a manned machine developed by a lab in South  Korea.  It`s taken more than two years and $200 million to bring the idea  to life.   It`s not finished.  The designer compares it to a baby taking its first  steps and they`re big ones.  The   weighs more than 1   tons.   So there is the man in the machine and he`s got to love heavy metal.  Some  think it`s just a prototype to play Robocop so you can keep your  mechanized field for that.  It`s certain there is a method to the madness  and that is ?10 out of 10? for CNN TEN where the puns are intended and  automatic. I`m Carl Azuz.  Thank you so much for watching.

That code was apparently discovered on a laptop at the Burlington   Electric Department in Vermont  on Friday. ? ?   The code was apparently not used to disrupt operations at the   Vermont utility and officials there said the laptop in question   is not associated with the operation of the electrical grid. ? ?   ?The grid is not in danger?

301,64827,UN Security Council welcomes Russo-Turkish brokered Syria truce but rebels warn they?ll abandon it if violations continue,Business Insider,,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?  ? ?   BEIRUT (Reuters)   The United Nations Security Council on   Saturday welcomed a ceasefire in the Syrian civil war but rebel   groups threatened to abandon the    truce if violations   persisted. ? ?   A resolution welcoming the ceasefire the third truce this year   seeking to end nearly six years of war was adopted unanimously   by the   Council meeting in New York. ? ?   The deal brokered by Russia and Turkey which back opposing   sides reduced violence but firefights air strikes and shelling   went on in some areas. ? ?   Factions belonging to the Free Syrian Army (FSA)   a loose   alliance of militias excluding more radical Islamist groups     said government forces and   Lebanese Hezbollah   fighters had been trying to push rebels back in the Wadi Barada   valley northwest of Damascus. ? ?   ?Continued violations by the regime and bombardment and attempts   to attack areas under the control of the revolutionary factions   will make the agreement null and void? said a statement from the   rebel groups. ? ?   The rebels and political opposition said the government side was   massing forces to launch a ground attack in the area. There has   been no new announcement by the military since it launched   operations in the area last week. ? ?   FSA factions said in a separate statement that they would abandon   the truce deal if Russia whose air power has helped President   Bashar   to turn the tide of the war did not use its   influence to halt the Wadi Barada attacks by 8 p. m. (1 p. m. ET). ? ?   Later two rebel officials said air raids around Wadi Barada had   stopped just before 8 p. m. and that the ceasefire therefore still   held although clashes in the area were continuing. ? ?   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group   confirmed that there had been fighting in the area source of   most of the capital?s water and said there had also been   government shelling in the southern provinces of Quneitra and   Deraa. ? ?  ? ?   Russia?s Defense Ministry said on Friday that rebels had violated   the truce 12 times in 24 hours. Much of Friday?s violence took   place along the border between Hama and Idlib provinces in   northwest Syria. ? ?   Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan   Rouhani agreed in a telephone call on Saturday to work together   to try to end the Syria crisis and make a success of peace talks   planned for the Kazakh capital Astana the Kremlin said in a   statement. ? ?   The   Observatory said the level of fighting had   fallen on Saturday and the truce was not currently at risk   although one rebel official said it was ?in serious danger?. ? ?   In their statement the FSA factions said it appeared the   government and opposition had signed two different versions of   the ceasefire deal one of which was missing ?a number of key and   essential points that are  ? but did not say what   those were. ? ?   The ceasefire deal is the first not to involve the United States   or the United Nations. ? ?   The Security Council welcomed the truce despite being urged by   the FSA factions not to endorse the deal until the Syrian   government and Russia had shown they would respect it. ? ?   The resolution also welcomed plans for the talks in Kazakhstan   before a resumption of U. N.  talks in Geneva in February. ? ?   The war has killed more than 300 000 people and made more than 11   million homeless. ? ?   Even with a successful truce between Assad and the main armed   opposition the   conflict will continue. ? ?   In particular Turkey is trying to push back Kurdish forces and   the jihadist Islamic State both excluded from the deal from   areas south of its border. ? ?   The position of other Islamist groups such as Jabhat Fateh     and Ahrar   with respect to the ceasefire is   unclear; both have criticized it. ? ?     ? ?

302,64828,A giant wave of store closures is about to hit the US,Business Insider,Hayley Peterson,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?  ? ?   Retailers are bracing for a fresh wave of store closures at the   start of the new year.  ? ?   The industry is heading into 2017 with a glut of store space as   shopping continues to shift online and foot traffic to malls   declines according to analysts. ? ?    ? ?  ? ?   Nearly every major department store including   Macy?s Kohl?s Walmart and Sears have collectively   closed hundreds of stores over the last couple   years to try and stem losses from unprofitable stores and   the rise of ecommerce.  ? ?? ?   But the closures are far from over. ? ?Sears is shuttering  by April and additional   closures are expected to be announced soon.   ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?   As stores continue to close many shopping malls will be forced   to shut down as well. ? ?   When an anchor store like Sears or Macy??s closes it   often triggers a ?downward spiral in performance? for   shopping malls Morningstar analysts wrote in the   report from October. ? ?   The malls don??t only lose the income and shopper traffic from   that store??s business. The closure often triggers   ?  clauses? that allow the remaining mall   tenants to exercise their right to terminate their leases or   renegotiate the terms typically with a period of lower   rents until another retailer moves into the vacant anchor   space.  ? ?      ? ?   That can have ?grave? consequences for shopping   malls especially in markets where it??s harder to transform   vacant mall space into   space like apartments   according to the analysts. ? ?   The Morningstar report supports another recent analysis from   Credit Suisse .  ?
303,64830,Judge blocks North Carolina law meant to limit incoming Democratic governor?s power,Business Insider,,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?  ? ?   A North Carolina judge on Friday temporarily blocked a state law   hours after incoming Democratic Governor Roy Cooper sued to void     legislation lessening his control over state   and county elections boards local media reported. ? ?   Cooper??s transition team described the measure which would have   abolished the current state elections board on Sunday when he   will be sworn in during a private ceremony as ?unconstitutional   legislative overreach.? ? ?   The law enacted by the state?s   legislature   during a special session this month calls for the governor and   legislature to appoint four members each to a new board evenly   split between Republicans and Democrats. Previously governors   appointed a majority of members. ? ?   The measure also replaces   county elections boards   where the sitting governor?s party had the majority with     boards made up of two Republicans and two Democrats   each. ? ?   A temporary restraining order issued by a Wake County Superior   Court judge will stop the law from taking effect on Sunday   WRAL. com reported. ? ?  ? ?   Cooper?s lawsuit argues that the changes violate the state   constitution?s separation of powers requirements by shifting   control from the executive agency responsible for administering   election laws to legislators according to media reports. ? ?   The law was among a series of measures approved during a special   session in   to curtail Cooper?s executive authority   before he succeeds outgoing Republican Governor Pat McCrory. ? ?   ?This complex new law passed in just two days by the Republican   legislature is unconstitutional and anything but bipartisan?   Cooper said in a statement. ?A tie on a partisan vote would   accomplish what many Republicans want: making it harder for North   Carolinians to vote.? ? ?   McCrory who trailed Cooper by about 10 000 votes when he   conceded the race nearly four weeks after the Nov. 8 election   and other Republican leaders have argued the new elections law   would help ensure a fair voting process. ? ?   Senate leader Phil Berger on Friday criticized Cooper?s legal   action. ? ?   ?Roy Cooper?s effort to stop the creation of a bipartisan board   with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans to enforce   elections and ethics laws may serve his desire to preserve his   own political power but it does not serve the best interests of   our state? Berger said in a statement. ? ?   (Editing by Steve Orlofsky) ?
304,64831,11 reasons driving a supercar isn?t as cool as you think,Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?Ah supercars! They are the thoroughbreds of the automotive world. They can cost millions they go very fast and they attract plenty of attention in traffic and when pulling up to valet lines.? ?People dream about owning a Ferrari a Lamborghini a McLaren a Pagani or a Bugatti all their lives from a tender young age right up until they experience that third or fourth midlife crisis. And though these storied brands make more domesticated ?practical? machines it??s the   supercars that capture the imagination.? ?But . .. are they really all that?? ?Well they are. But they?re also on many levels beautiful exotic alluring exciting total pains in the ass. Here?s why.? ?Ground clearance isn?t a supercar forte. It can?t be  ?   these   machines are supposed to slip though the air cheating the wind and their aerodynamics are designed to keep them glued to the road.? ?This of course means that a modest blemish in the roadway can result in thousands of dollars in damage to the car. America?s crumbling infrastructure is an     foe.? ?It kind of sucks the pleasure out of driving your Lamborghini if you have to keep a constantly watchful eye out for potholes and speed bumps and if you can?t even really navigate your own driveway.? ?What do you do with horsepower in excess of 600 ponies? Who knows because in 99. 99% of driving circumstances you?re not going use it.? ?But you will still incinerate gasoline at an alarming rate. ? ?If you do try to tap into the power you run a gamut of risks. You could lose control of the car and have a very costly accident. You could pay no attention to your actual speed and endure a very costly speeding ticket. ? ?You could also just get depressed. Nothing is sadder than a supercar stuck in traffic looking gorgeous but with no hope of unleashing its potential. You paid for that power! But you?ll rarely get to experience it.? ?The cheapest supercars are still quite expensive and you always face the question of whether your  $100 000 ?supercar? is a true supercar. So you feel the pressure to man up for the pricier shiny metal. ? ?And then you will invariably:? ?1. Bang into something and need to get your investment repaired.? ?2. Have to get something fixed that goes wrong with your ride.? ?In either case you?ll be parting with huge sums of money  ?     staggering sums in fact if you?re used to dropping your Lexus off at the dealership for a brake job.? ?You may also have to wait months to get the car back.? ?Plush   sedans are optimized for the comfort of the driver and passengers. ? ?Supercars are not with few exceptions: The Acura NSX has a reputation for being compliant and the McLaren 650S is easy to drive.? ?But the whole point of the supercar is to tuck you down in a low tub made of carbon fiber or magnesium swaddle you in firm bolstered   seats and scare the bejeezus out of you as soon as you put the pedal down.? ?And then just try tooling around town.  and though I was grateful for the nominal cupholders (a supercar rarity) and I certainly enjoyed the spirited driving part by the time I was heading back to Pasadena California from Malibu and trying to get through Downtown Los Angeles my lower back and I were no longer on speaking terms.? ?It doesn?t matter where you go. You can?t hide. Someone will always approach you with questions admiring declarations and requests for selfies.? ?Not that you should expect otherwise. You bought a bright red supercar and didn?t plan to hide it in your garage for its lifetime. ? ?But it does get wearisome after that 1 000th time at the gas pump when the dude next to you rolls out the interrogation.? ?That said if you?re a social person this could be a boon. There is a sort of brotherhood (and sisterhood) of  . So you?ll be part of an exclusive club that always has something to talk about.? ?You may not be but this is a risk you take when you go in for supercar ownership. The jerkiest photos ever taken of me have featured me behind the wheel of a supercar  ?   and I?m not going to even try to deny it.? ?They change your character. You become a swaggering rock god when in real life you might be a meek bureaucrat. There?s nothing you can do about it. It?s like slipping on a bright yellow suit. There will be judgments.? ?With suspensions that are about as tight as the Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East in 1970s plus the aforementioned snug ground clearance chances are that your beverage will not go unspilled in a supercar.? ?Even in the unlikely event that your supercar has cupholders they will offer no protection from the sloshing created by bumps in the road. Or just the road. ? ?So you can forget about refreshments. Mind you there are those who would say that if you?re worried about your morning coffee in your supercar you shouldn?t actually have a supercar. But that?s a ridiculously purist attitude. Caffeine is a right.? ?Supercars aren?t allowed to be dirty. Heck they aren?t allowed to be smudged. ? ?Fingerprints must be immediately buffed out. And let?s not even talk about that which birds will sometime do in the vicinity of cars. You?re best off keeping your supercar inside when it rains.? ?The implicit requirement that you maintain your supercar in   condition if not    nick is oppressive. These are no machines that you can run through the   car wash. No they demand detailing. Every single time they?re cleaned. ? ?And not just any detailing but rather   detailing. So if you?re accustomed to that   detailing bill of $200 well get ready for Special   detailing  ?   and the massive hit to your bank account.? ?No one ever tells you this.? ?They just assume that you?ll be able to get on with the rest of your life after you buy a supercar.? ?But supercars aren?t meant to be ignored. They command attention. Your attention. All the time.? ?I recently borrowed a Ferrari 488 GTB from the manufacturer to review and I kid you not  ?   I literally had to remind myself to stop looking at it and do something else. I was hypnotized.? ?Supercars don?t have much cargo capacity unless you define cargo as a couple of bottles of Champagne.? ?This means you won?t be taking many road trips in your supercar. ? ?The legal speed limit it much of the US is 65 mph.? ?A lot of supercars can brush that off in less than 4 seconds on their way to top speeds that threaten or exceed 200 mph.? ?How awesome! You spend hundred of thousands on a car that can legally achieve about a quarter of its performance potential.? ?There is no art without struggle. ? ?You will have rough patches with your supercar; you will agree that the two best days for a supercar owner are the day you buy and the day you sell.? ?But then the light will come down at just the right angle and catch the car just so and your ride will take your breath away again the way it has so many times before.? ?Maybe I?ll keep it!?

I??ve realized that it isn??t about perfection  ?   it??s about owning your strengths having the humility to see where you need the strength of others and being open and impressionable to change.? ??It??s within my reach and I feel now more than ever that this type of confidence in everyone will be critical to the future we all want to see come to fruition. ?? ??My New Year??s resolution is once and for all to spend significantly less time reading and writing emails and far more time being present and looking people in the eye. ?? ??In 2017 I want to spend more time mentoring young women interested in STEM and entrepreneurship. It??s easy to fall into the trap of feeling too busy to give back. The truth is the more success you have the busier you get. So you have to proactively make time to do things that are important to you. ?? ??My New Year??s resolution is to use the power and influence of TripAdvisor??s brand to aid in the humanitarian refugee crisis that we??re seeing in many parts of the Middle East Africa and Europe today.? ??In addition to our commitment to organizations like Mercy Corps and The International Rescue Committee I want to encourage others in the travel industry and around the world to take action and help provide refugees with critical access to information essential education opportunities and resettlement support.? ??It??s one of the worst humanitarian disasters of our generation. Years from now I want my grandkids to know that I joined with others and chose to help if only in a small way. ?? ? ? ??? ??In 2017 my husband and I have a shared resolution of ??accelerated growth??: discovering experimenting and implementing   challenges that optimize our health performance and impact.? ??We choose     to radically change for the entire month each month. It may be a new specific exercise every day or eliminating a particular food taking a certain supplement or a new way to connect with our friends or community every single day for 30 straight days.? ??We already do   on our monthiversary to invest in our relationship so we??ll add these new goals to that to drive accountability. The new habits that create the most impact will become our improved rituals. Bring on the badassery! ?? ??From a business standpoint we??re committed to giving our clients the financial information they need when they want it. And so we??re working hard  ?   and borrowing from technology startups and   companies  ?   to make sure our clients have an engaging digital experience that builds on the expertise of our financial representatives.? ??Personally I??m going in the other direction with my kids and am committed to getting them outdoors more in 2017. I want to help my    son catch a legal ??muskie??  ?   which in Wisconsin is a fish that is more than 40 inches long and doesn??t bite easily. You can??t get that adrenaline rush from a screen! ?? ??My New Year??s resolution is to practice extreme ownership: the idea that you are responsible for every situation and relationship in your life no excuses.? ??This last year I found myself frustrated with situations and felt like I had no ability to improve them. After reading ???? by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin my whole perspective on my control over situations changed. Now it??s time to put my knowledge to work! ?? ??I just joined Instagram this past fall (late to the party!) when I launched my book ???? to create awareness for maternal health. One of my 2017 resolutions is to use my social platforms to build awareness for organizations that empower women. Being philanthropic can be fun and isn?t always about making a financial contribution. ?? ?? ?? ??That means less responding to emails the moment they come in more walks more saying ??no?? to random requests more ??me and a glass of wine and a piece of paper?? and more time with the creative people I work with and know. ?? ??In 2017 I??m excited to cook more continue growing The Muse and see at least one play show or musical every month.? ??On the work front we??ve more than doubled the size of our team in the last year and I??m excited to spend 2017 investing deeply in those people and building the foundation for our   team brand and ultimately success! ?? ??In the past I??ve always considered the dedication and passion put towards Ghetto Film School as my sole cause focus. I realize however that there??s a lot of good work out there that deserves my support including new things happening in the museum academic and art world that I??m eager to get involved in. ?? ??I am telling  you this because it??s like running a marathon  ?   if you tell a lot of people you are doing it you sort of have to. My friends have been telling me this for ages and it??s high time I go for it. Nothing ventured nothing gained. ?? ??I??m a writer first and foremost and so I automatically think to communicate with people via books articles and blog posts but there are so many other ways to connect these days.? ??In particular I want to do more Facebook Live chats (so easy!) and I want to finally have an active presence on Instagram. I take pictures all the time but I never think about sharing them. Clearly my brain does not work that way but this year I??m going to try. ?? ??This simple ritual  ?   called the ??three blessings exercise??  ?   has been shown in   research to make you happier but I??m doing it for a different reason.? ??In fact I??m doing it for its own sake. I want to appreciate what??s going right in my life especially the people who make my life so wonderful. ?? ??My    old is obsessed with the guitar so my goal is to learn to play guitar serviceably. Only then will I be on par with his other great hero Spiderman. ?? ??New Year??s resolutions  ?   especially the financial ones  ?   are always a work in progress so I like to check in periodically throughout the year to   and if necessary reset. But for now I??m going into 2017 with three specific money goals in mind:? ??First I want to focus on my baby girl Toby. She??ll be two in March but it??s never too early to impart good money values and management skills to your little ones. To start teaching Toby about saving my husband and I have given her six different piggy banks each representing a different savings goal. For example she has a piggy bank for college and a piggy bank for the bicycle that??s on her wish list this year.? ??Second my husband and I are thinking more strategically about how our own saving can help ensure Toby has a sound financial future ahead of her.? ??Last but not least is sticking to our own budget. This one requires ongoing attention so it??s a resolution we make every year. ???
307,64834,?You may be seeing a bit more of me?: Jesse Watters discusses past controversies and his future at Fox News,Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?  ? ?   Fox News host Bill O??Reilly raised eyebrows earlier this year   when he  he may not be interested in hosting his ratings   juggernaut ?The O??Reilly Factor? for much longer. ? ?   When the   heavyweight eventually decides to retire a   piece of his legacy will live on in a protg groomed for Fox   News stardom: Jesse Watters. ? ?   ?I think he??s either living vicariously through me or he??s   reliving things he did back in the day? Watters said of   O??Reilly. ? ?   Over the past decade Watters?? segments on O??Reilly??s show  ?     dubbed ?Watters World? by O??Reilly  ?   have become an integral part   of the broadcast bookending ?The O??Reilly Factor? twice a week. ? ?   Ranging several minutes ?Watters World? finds the Fox   correspondent interviewing and poking fun at average people on   the street in primarily liberal enclaves often college campuses   or various neighborhoods in New York City. Recent episodes showed   Watters interviewing Canadians about   Donald Trump   and interviewing veterans at Hampshire College protesting the   school??s decision to take down the flag following Trump??s   election. ? ?? ?   Watters also serves as an extension of O?Reilly during ambush   interview segments unafraid to get into his interview subject?s   face with aggressive questions unrelenting particularly when his   questions are unwelcome. ? ?   ?When the cause is just and there??s been injustice then it??s   easy to kind of galvanize your emotions and confront a guy?   Watters told Business Insider in an interview in December. ?And   it??s intense and there??s a lot of adrenaline involved but those   usually make a big splash.? ? ?   O?Reilly will often tease the segments which are stacked at the   back of the program with the idea that they are a draw for   viewers. ? ?   According to Watters O?Reilly generates many of the ideas for   the segments himself and often has visuals and locations in mind. ? ?   ?Usually he??ll say like ??This is kind of how I want you to   approach it?? and then he??ll give me one line and then I have to   fill in the rest? Watters said. ?Bill is very understanding of   the backdrop of the segment. I think because he was a field guy   for so many years he??s very interested in aesthetics behind the   ??Watters World?? where it??s being shot why it??s being shot   there.? ? ?   But while Watters described 2016 as a banner year for the show   with high ratings and interviews with   guests like     presidential nominee Donald Trump Watters has   also found his brand of     and ambush interviews   under greater scrutiny. ? ?   In October Watters  over a       segment he shot in New York?s Chinatown. ? ?   Ostensibly dispatched to discuss China??s role in the 2016   presidential election Watters invoked numerous racial   stereotypes of   for a laugh. He quizzed people   about whether it was the ?year of the dragon? inquired about   karate lessons and asked whether he was supposed to bow to Asian   passersby he saw on the street. ? ?   The segment was  by media outlets and   lawmakers alike  ?   The Washington Post dubbed it ??   while Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said Watters ?should be   ashamed? of his conduct. ? ?   Though he offered a fairly restrained apology in October Watters   characterized the segment as a mistake and a learning experience. ? ?   ?I was surprised at the time with the blowback? Watters told   Business Insider. ?I didn??t see it coming and that??s on me. I   understand I did offend a lot of people and I??m very sorry for   that. People took issue with some of the statements I made and   some of the reaction to the Chinatown segment and I understand   that. And it??s a learning experience  ?   I definitely learned a lot   from it. But it??s a new day and we are moving forward with it.? ? ?   He added: ?It??s a controversial segment ??Watters World. ?? There??s   controversy around it. There??s controversy around Fox I   understand that. But I listen to people and I never want to   intentionally cause anybody to be upset. It was never my   intention to hurt people??s feelings. And I regret that I did hurt   people??s feelings.? ? ?   Asked if he would have conducted himself differently Watters   paused. ? ?   ?I would but I don??t want to dissect this segment  ?   I think it??s   been dissected? he replied. ? ?   It wasn?t Watters? first time facing criticism; at one point the   Fox News correspondent found himself in a brief physical   altercation with Huffington Post editor Ryan Grim over Watters?     ambush of Huffington Post editor Amanda Terkel. ? ?   More recently Washington Post media columnist Erik Wemple    for eschewing a   traditional   or phone interview in favor of an ambush.   Wemple took issue with Watters? decision to stick his foot into   the president of Hampshire College?s private residence during an   ambush interview about the college?s decision not to fly the   American flag. ? ?   Asked about the criticism Watters indicated he did not know who   Wemple was and noted that Hampshire reversed course just days   after the segment aired. ? ?   ?I??ll let that speak for itself? Watters said. ? ?   Watters added: ?I don??t pay attention to a lot of that stuff that   they write. It doesn??t really bother me that much. I stand by my   work especially the confrontations. There are heroes and   villains out there in the media landscape in the news landscape   in the political landscape. People sometimes get called out they   react how they react. And I??m proud of what I do.? ? ?   Viewers of ?The O??Reilly Factor? and Fox News have been equally   unshaken by critics teeing up Watters for perhaps one of his   biggest career years. ? ?   The correspondent will reprise his role as anchor during Fox??s   New Year??s Eve special and he is set to make his debut on   O??Reilly??s nationwide comedy tour. Watters has also been able to   maintain the ratings dominance of ?The O??Reilly Factor? when   filling in for the bombastic host easily besting CNN and MSNBC   when anchoring the show in December. ? ?   Watters himself hinted at a potentially larger role at the   network in the coming year. ? ?   ?Whatever Fox wants me to do I??ll do? Watters said. ?I??m just   going to keep working hard keep my head down. There may be a few   surprises coming up in the new year  ?   you??ll have to stay tuned   for that. You may be seeing a little bit more of me.? ? ?   For the moment Watters is anticipating how the incoming   administration?s politics will affect many of his       segments which have often revolved around   questioning liberal dogma and Obama administration policies. ? ?   Though he said that poking fun at the left ?never gets old? he   acknowledged that he was ?getting a little tired? of soliciting   responses to the Obama administration??s practices. ? ?   ?I think it??s time for a change? Watters said. ?I think Donald   Trump is going to make Watters World great again. Because it??s   going to be a new dynamic on the streets. And that??s something   I??m looking forward to. It??s definitely going to turn the whole   thing upside down and that??ll be a new challenge.? ? ? Disclosure: This reporter briefly worked as a fellow at The   Huffington Post. ?
308,64835,The 50 best movies of 2016 according to critics,Business Insider,,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?As  participating in our annual Criticwire survey here are the best films of the year.? ??It?s Lonergan?s masterfully subtle writing littered with awkward exchanges that speak far louder than any cohesive monologue that gives ?Manchester? its humanity. ?  ?  EK? ??At its best ?La La Land? probes the irony of its existence celebrating the greatness of a bygone era in the context of changing times. ?  ?  EK? ??The two leads? extraordinary authenticity allows ?Toni Erdmann? to keep propelling forward juggling themes about family and   balance that stretch beyond the cultural specificity of its setting. ?  ?  EK? ??First screened to raves at Sundance in January the compelling narrative seamlessly takes us from Los Angeles in the ?60s when Simpson was a star USC football player and the city faced the Watts race riots through the aftermath of the Simpson trial. ?  ?  Anne Thompson? ??Carried by an appropriately   Adam Driver and Jarmusch?s casual genius for capturing offhand remarks ?Paterson? is his most absorbing character study since ?Broken Flowers?  ?   and far more grounded in real life. ?  ?  EK? ???The Handmaiden? works as a form of historical fantasy in which love conquers all but not in the ways one might expect. ?  ?  EK? ???Arrival? is no  ; it is Adams? film through and through. The actress makes a very strong lead embodying the kind of swashbuckling language pedant whose eyes light with adventure when offered a particularly challenging conjugation. ?  ?  Ben Croll? ??Just as it taps into a dying corner of American society ?Hell or High Water? resurrects the power of western mayhem done right. ?  ?  EK? ??For his first   production  ?   and his first   film in a decade  ?   the    filmmaker has delivered his most contained work in years a dark comedy about sexual urges and other passions closer in form to 1973?s ?Turkish Delight? than anything he?s made since. ?  ?  EK? ??The cold the distance the arduous labor the subtle class divisions and the unwelcoming men  ?     all of these help define why these certain women are the way they are. ?  ?  Noel Murray? ??More than that the two dozen projects showcased here alongside original footage confront the process of creation. This is a   guide to a life of looking. ?  ?  EK? ???The Lobster? brings Lanthimos? distinct blend of morbid deadpan humor and surrealism to a broader canvas without compromising his ability to deliver another thematically rich provocation. ?  ?  EK? ??Most films are domestic animals: cats or dogs. Some particularly beautiful ones might be horses or dolphins. But amongst the Fidos the Fluffys and the Flippers Apichatpong Weerasethakul?s ?Cemetery of Splendour? is a Northern White Rhino the most endangered species in the world. ?  ?  Jessica Kiang? ??A   tale filled with beautiful imagery and understated performances its elegance yields one of Scorsese?s most subtle efforts. ?  ?

EK? ??There?s vision here clearly and through the use of   frames and a standout score ?The Fits? works like magic as an experimental performance piece. ?  ?  Nikola Grozdanovic? ??It?s the closest thing to a magnum opus in Arnold?s blossoming career. ?  ?  EK? ??  Robert Eggers? accomplished   debut manages a tricky balance: On the one hand an elegant period piece about the dissolution of a New England family circa 1630 it?s also a genuinely unsettling horror movie about possession. ?  ?  EK? ??Though Braga?s performance sometimes outshines Mendona?s leisurely     hour narrative in its better moments the two work in marvelous harmony. ?  ?

At the same time they carry a profound beauty that hints at more uplifting possibilities. ?  ?  EK? ??But if Carney?s latest jam proves that he can?t change his spots it also shows that he knows how to learn from his mistakes. For a filmmaker so fixated on the same story that can be a far more valuable skill. ?  ?  David Ehrlich? ??A   and bittersweet bear hug of a memoir by far the most moving and mature of the four films he?s made to date. ?  ?  DE? ???Things to Come? is less a story of becoming than it is one of survival but as its relatively aged heroine begins to molt from the crust of her past and steel herself for the unwritten chapters of her life those two goals begin to seem like one and the same. ?  ?  DE? ??With ?Loving? the director moves from the combination of otherworldly lyricism and genre storytelling in ?Take Shelter? ?Mud? and ?Midnight Special? toward more conventional drama by exploring the intimate details behind its legacy. ?  ?  EK? ???Nocturnal Animals? is an impressively ambitious effort one part mean Texas thriller one part   melodrama and makes for a   riddle that is almost as pleasurable to reflect on as it to actually watch. ?  ?  BC? ??Hong not only finds an intriguing gimmick to play with but then proceeds to use it for genuinely revealing purposes. ?  ?  Kenji Fujishima ? ??Raoul Peck?s ?I Am Not Your Negro? masterfully encompasses what it means to break through cycles of isolation and invisibility. ?  ?  Aramide A Tinubu? ??Here is a movie that?s genuinely alive plunging into theaters with the style of a swan dive and the impact of a cannonball. It?s a messy romp that?s funny hot and horrifying in equal measure; and if it squeaks a bit whenever it tries to shift gears that sound just becomes another instrument in Guadagnino?s latest symphony of the senses. ?  ?  DE? ??Staggeringly beautiful and immensely true the best animated film of 2016  ?   one of the year?s best films of any kind really  ?   is a   fable about a   boy in mythical Japan that was made by a team of gifted visionaries in an Oregon warehouse. ?  ?

EK? ??The only certainty is Tsangari has delivered another intriguing and thoroughly original character study which this time serves as an apt metaphor for Greece?s larger problems. ?  ?  EK? ??The Coens deftly manage to have it both ways playing their   centerpieces straight in order to honor   filmmaking and then punctuating them with   punchlines. ?  ?  Nick Schager? ??Waititi who?s been picked out by Marvel to direct ?Thor: Ragnarok? this year knows how to construct a tight movie with joyful warm   characters. ?  ?  Sam Fragoso? ??A predictable bittersweet look at the bureaucratic impact of medical assistance on an ailing   carpenter the movie pulls off no fancy tricks in its straightforward didactic approach.

And imaging is integral to increasing that understanding and improving treatments. In new studies being presented at the RSNA conference researchers used CT scans MRIs ultrasounds and   modeling to get a better picture. ? ?Thanks to these technologies the researchers were able to figure out a few key things including more evidence that Zika can cause brain damage in babies with and without microcephaly something that other .? ?Beyond putting together better images researchers are also trying to figure out if there?s a way we could analyze these images in a smarter way with the help of machine learning.? ?One area where that?s being .

315,64843,I traveled to Cuba after Fidel Castro?s death ? and it was far different from what I expected,Business Insider,Harrison Jacobs,1/2/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   Cuba appears to be in a historical moment. ? ?   In early December Fidel Castro . It had been my assumption   that his death was like the sun dropping out of the solar system   for the   island nation. Things were going to start   to come apart and soon. ? ?   I traveled to Cuba two weeks after his death with this in mind  ?     expecting something but not quite sure what. ? ?   Though I was born after the end of the Cold War Castro was one   of the few boogeymen of the era to retain his stature. Even as   the Soviet Union disintegrated and Russia reassembled itself and   China underwent rapid economic growth Cuba and Castro held   resolute. ? ?   But he gave up power in 2006 to his brother Raul and there have   been shy signs of liberalization since. A series of economic   reforms  has allowed Cubans   to . In   2014 US President Barack Obama and Raul  that has reopened diplomatic   relations made it simpler for Americans  ?   like me  ?   to visit   and lifted some of the economic restrictions between the   countries. ? ?   All of this was capped off by Obama?s  and the official   commencement of flights from American commercial airlines this   fall. ? ?   I suppose what I was expecting was the chance to witness   change  ?   a nation grinding itself awake to the ways   of the majority of the world. That?s approximately what I told my   taxi driver Rafael as he sped out of Havana and onto an empty   highway toward the countryside one Sunday morning. He smiled   behind his   Aviator sunglasses which were situated   over a rectangular pair of prescription glasses. ? ?   ?Everyone that gets in my car talks about change? he said   glancing back. ?But I don?t see any change. All I see is more of   the same.? ? ?   The sentiment was one I heard over and over again even as I   witnessed fruits of Cuba?s liberalization. There wasn?t a tourist   I met in the country who didn?t mention expecting to witness some   undefined change or wanting to visit   before  the change arrived usually imagined   in the form of overweight Americans puffing cigars outside   newly built McDonald?s and Starbucks. ? ?   There?s an arrogance to that reason for visiting which I was as   aware of in myself as in others I met along the way. It amounts   to a kind of ?poverty tourism?  ?   ?look at the quaint classic   cars? or ?I want to visit before the Havana?s buildings are   rebuilt.? ? ?   The Cubans I met seemed to recognize the developments while also   remaining skeptical that after nearly 60 years of Communist rule   any significant change would occur. A   street sweeper   said to me that all the government does is talk and that he?d   sooner believe ?the sun the moon or the ocean? if it told him   something than Raul Castro and the Communist Party. ? ?   Change in a place like Cuba is almost imperceptibly slow. The   entire culture seems predicated on waiting  ?   for the bus to   arrive for the supermarket to open for an internet card for   the bank. It is so ingrained that if you get on a line shout   ? ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?  ? ?   ?The economy is very bad here? Rafael said. ?The worst in the   world I think. Nothing costs what it should. Everything is too   expensive.? ? ?  ? ?  ? ?   ?Do you know how much it costs to buy a car like this?? he asked.   Both Jai and I took a guess  ?   $1 500? $2 000? Rafael laughed. ? ?   ?$30 000? he said letting the answer hang without explanation.   We both exclaimed surprise at the figure. ? ?   ?Is that in CUC? I asked referring to the Cuban convertible   peso the Cuban currency pegged to the US dollar and used   primarily by tourists or for Cubans to buy luxury goods. (Cuba   has a second currency known as the peso used almost exclusively   by Cubans for basic goods and worth   of the CUC.) ? ?   ?CUC dollars euros whatever you have? he said before adding   ?$30 000 for this!? ? ?   He pointed at the interior of the car. It had seen better days.   The seats were collapsing despite having been reupholstered in a   cheap green fabric. The air conditioner blew lukewarm air. The   windows were tinted to near black but one of the handles to roll   them down had broken off. The exterior of the car was dented and   scratched. ? ?   Rafael went on to explain that because of the US?s      (and counting) embargo and Cuba?s general   isolation there is a massive shortage of cars on the island   which has driven prices to absurd levels. ? ?   I forgot to ask how he obtained his car given that the price was   so exorbitant and loans are not common. Other taxi drivers   provided answers: They were provided cars as part of their   previous jobs for the government were able to buy     ones and then fix them piecemeal as they made enough money or   were handed down by family members who obtained them through   similar means. ? ?   Every so often a gleaming new   Geely or   South   Kia blew past us on the highway. Jai a   car junky asked Rafael if Cubans were driving the cars. Rafael   shook his head and explained that only government officials   receive the new cars. The rest are only there to be rented out to   tourists. ? ?   Though some are available for purchase to Cuban citizens   the prices like that of Rafael?s Lada are exorbitant. Prices   for the Asian cars top 80 000 CUC despite the fact that they   retail in China or the US for approximately $20 000. The extreme   scarcity of the cars is only part of the issue he said. The   government imposes heavy taxes on the vehicles to . ? ?   Essentially the only people that own cars on the island are   government workers foreigners and people who make their living   from driving. An increase in US tourism is unlikely to change   that reality.  ? ?   Rafael was probably the most pessimistic person we met on   the trip. When I asked him about the prospect of Raul Castro   stepping down in a year or so his response was that a Castro  ?     any Castro  ?   would replace him. (Most Cuba experts think it   would actually be  a rising star in the party and one of the   first of the   generation to gain power.) Change   in his mind was impossible no matter how much US investment or   tourists arrive on Cuba?s shores. ? ?   ?The people want the changes? Rafael said ?but the   government controls everything and it always will. Things may   change a little but the government will always know how to get   its money.? ? ?   He went on to explain that because of  and the government?s tax structure   the prices for most   are already equivalent to or   higher than their prices in the US or Europe and therefore   unaffordable to Cubans. Increased tourism has already driven up   prices for many things on the island. And even if there is an   influx of capital from US tourists and businesses Rafael was   skeptical any great benefit would come to the average Cuban. Most   of the money will flow back to the Cuban government he said. ? ?   It was a strange thing to hear from a man who told us an hour   before that he quit his agricultural engineering job for the   government because he knew he could make four times his monthly   engineering salary in a day driving tourists from Havana to   Vinales and back. ? ?   But Rafael elaborated his point by talking about the casa   particular system which  in their houses or   apartments to tourists for 20 to 35 CUC per night in a sort of    . (In fact Airbnb .) The system has been around officially since   1997 when the government allowed casa hosts to register   with the government as legal businesses though reports say   Cubans rented out rooms under the table for years before. ? ?   The casa system is like a   where tourists can   stay with and get to know average Cubans. I had assumed that by   staying in casas instead of the   hotels we were   giving money directly to regular Cubans but the real situation   is more murky Rafael said.  ? ?  ? ? Here?s how he put it (  by my   girlfriend who speaks far better Spanish than I): ? ?   ?Go outside of the casas and you will see the houses   that the rest of Cuba lives in. A strong wind would blow them   over? he concluded. ? ?  ? ?   In Vinales we saw the houses he was talking about. Past the town   center and the adjacent streets where the casas lay were     shacks pushing up out of the ground like unruly weeds.   We hired a guide Luis to take us through the valley on   horseback and we sat in his   house while he saddled the   horses. He had clearly built the stable himself and the horses   of which he had five were unkempt and thin but he cared for   them lovingly. He took us past his house and through tobacco   fields a coffee plantation and several caves. ? ?   A former pork butcher who had been pushed out of the business   when the government nationalized the industry several years ago   Luis had even less humor about the plight of Cuba than Rafael. ? ?   Annie mentioned that a casa host we stayed with in   Havana said that Cubans everywhere ?are happy and content.? Luis   responded bitterly. ? ?   ?Where? I do not see them? he said. ? ?   At the same time he was far more optimistic than Rafael. He   doesn?t take for granted that he is now able to live off the   income from his ranching business  ?   thanks to the influx of   tourists happy to pay for the horseback tour and the   liberalization that has allowed private enterprises to exist. ? ?  ? ?   Everywhere in Cuba we went  ?   Havana Vinales Trinidad and   the places in between  ?   the story was the same. ? ?   The taxi drivers and tour guides we met are doctors engineers   and professors who either retired early or quit out of   frustration at the low salaries. (In Cuba such highly regarded   professions make barely more than a street sweeper.) Instead   they picked up serving tourists because as Rafael said they can   make four times in a day what they used to make in a month. ? ?   The level of education and potential wasting away behind steering   wheels or taking orders at the   restaurants is   discouraging. Still again and again the same people who   lamented the difficulty of their situation and the overbearing   nature of the Cuban government would in the same breath defend   the legitimacy of the revolution due to the education food and   healthcare provided to the poor. ? ?  ? ?   On our last day in the country we spent about 15 minutes   standing on Linea Avenue in Vedado one of the more upscale   sections of Havana waiting to get a ride from a   collectivo (think UberPool). After successfully coaxing   a rusty red   Ford to stop for us we hopped into the   front seat. All the other seats were taken. A   man   no more than a few years older than me took a coin from someone   in the backseat and introduced himself as Javier. ? ?   Like other Cubans we met he was excited by the prospect of   speaking to Americans who even now rarely visit the island he   said. Javier spoke excellent English and Annie asked him where he   learned it. He told us that he learned at the University of   Havana where he was taught by one of the last professors to be   educated before the revolution. Prior to the revolution he   explained many of the classes and books were taught in English.   I asked if this meant he studied linguistics but he shook his   head. Like so many of our taxi drivers he was an engineer. But   not anymore. ? ?   I asked why. ? ?   ?I used to work for a company that is controlled by the   government but it wasn?t enough? he said. ?I got paid 20 CUC   per month. I also got a car and a cell phone. So it wasn?t all   bad. But I didn?t want those things handed to me. I wanted to   earn them myself. I wanted to make the money myself. There was   nowhere to go once you are there. So I left.? ? ?   He explained that after quitting he joined one of  to Equatorial Guinea to help the   country eliminate malaria. He spent five years there working on   the project and he loved it describing it as one of the best and   most freeing experiences of his life. He particularly enjoyed   when he was able to enter the American compounds of oil   conglomerates which he said were set up like  . ? ?   Reality came crashing down three years ago however when his   father died. There was no one left to support his family  ?   his   siblings and his two young children  ?   so he returned home. He   couldn?t bring himself to go back to the IT job so he scraped   together 1 500 CUC to buy the Ford. He qualified the price by   saying that the entire vehicle needed to be replaced  ?   it was   more or less just a shell. Piece by piece he put in a new   engine new floorboards new seats new clutch. Next on his list   was the roof. But it was all worth it. ? ?   It didn?t seem to occur to him that driving the   collectivo which more or less means following the same   bus route day in and day out might be boring. To him he was   running his own business and that?s what was important. For every   rider almost all Cubans collectivos make   cents   CUC. Collectivos appeared to always be at or   near their full capacity of five passengers. It is far more   lucrative than his old job he said. ? ?   We spent some time talking about why Annie and I came to Cuba now    ?   the 2014 agreement between Obama and Raul the desire to see   Cuba before and during the change and the prospect that the     thaw could be undone by   Donald Trump who   . Javier   laughed. ? ?   ?The Cuban people have suffered a lot. We?ve survived a lot? he   said. ?We survived Nixon two Bushes   ?     we?ll   survive Donald.? ? ?   To Javier the opening of Cuba the flowering of businesses and   industry and so on is inevitable. Tourism is a big business and   he suggested that he and many Cubans are ready for it.   Annie commented that because he speaks fluent English he is a   prime candidate to be a tour guide to   tourists.   He smiled and said that he?d been looking into getting training   from a tour company. ? ?   As if assuming the role he began to point out buildings to us   near Paseo de Marti one of the main strips in Old Havana  ?   the   Bacardi building the national ballet school Hotel Inglaterra   and finally Capitolio . ? ?   ?There is so much tradition in Cuba that was inspired by   America? he said. ?Many Cubans have forgotten but you can see   it in the buildings. ? ? ?   Before we got out at Capitolio our destination Javier thanked   us for coming to Cuba and told us to encourage more Americans to   visit. He said that what we read about on the news is not the   ?real Cuba? and that we (and other Americans) can only begin to   understand by visiting. ? ?   ?The reality is not simple? he said of Cuba. ?There is good and   bad here like every place. It is complicated.? ? ? [Editor?s note: All names have been changed to protect the   identities of those quoted.] ?
316,64844,Chicago?s bloody 2016 ends with 762 homicides ? the biggest spike in 60 years,Business Insider,,1/2/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   CHICAGO (AP)  ?   One of the most violent years in Chicago history   ended Sunday with a sobering tally: 762 homicides the most in   two decades and more than New York and Los Angeles combined. ? ?   The nation?s third largest city also saw 1 100 more shooting   incidents than it did in 2015 according to statistics released   by the Chicago Police Department that underlined a story of   bloodshed that has put Chicago at the center of a national   dialogue about gun violence. ? ?   The numbers released Sunday are staggering even for those   following the steady news accounts of weekends ending with dozens   of shootings and monthly death tolls that hadn?t been seen in   years. The increase in 2016 homicides compared to 2015 when 485   were reported is the largest spike in 60 years. ? ?   Police and city officials have lamented the flood of illegal guns   into the city and the crime statistics appeared to support their   claims: Police recovered 8 300 illegal guns in 2015 a 20 percent   from the previous year. ? ?   The bulk of the deaths and shooting incidents which jumped from   2 426 in 2015 to 3 550 last year occurred in only five   neighborhoods on the city?s South and West sides all poor and   predominantly black areas where gangs are most active. Police   said the shootings in those areas generally wasn?t random with   more than 80 percent of the victims having previously been   identified by police as more susceptible because of their gang   ties or past arrests. ? ?   Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson was expected to   discuss the newly released statistics Sunday afternoon. ? ?  ? ?   The city has scrambled to address the violence. Mayor Rahm   Emanuel announced last year that 1 000 officers would be added to   the police department. At the same time police officials have   been trying to figure out why homicides and shootings  ?   which   began climbing the year before  ?   suddenly surged. ? ?   Johnson has said several factors contributed to the increased   violence. He noted 2016 was the first full year since the city   was forced in November 2015 to release video of the fatal police   shooting of    Laquan McDonald who was black and shot   16 times by a white police officer. The video cost former Police   Superintendent Garry McCarthy his job sparked major protests   around the city and led to federal and state investigations of   the department. ? ?   It also left Johnson with the task of trying to restore public   trust in what appeared to be a weakened police force a   perception that was only buttressed by a dramatic drop in the   number of arrests in 2016. ? ?   While the police department has cited several factors for the   declining numbers including a concerted effort not to make minor   drug arrests and focus on gun violence Johnson acknowledged in a   recent interview with The Associated Press that officers have   become more cautious  ?   in part out of fear of becoming the next   ?viral video.? ? ?   That he said has ?emboldened? criminals. ? ?   ?Criminals watch TV pay attention to the media? he said. ?They   see an opportunity to commit nefarious activity.? ?

With a few notable exceptions biographies   textbooks obituaries and even public memory have dwelled little   on George W. Bush?s inaction in Darfur Bill Clinton?s   floundering over Rwanda George H. W. Bush?s dithering about   Bosnia Jimmy Carter?s fecklessness in Cambodia Gerald Ford?s   cold realism toward East Timor or Richard Nixon?s complicity in   Bangladesh. ? ? ?   Who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the   Armenians?? Hitler reportedly said in 1939 predicting that the   world?s amnesia about the Turks? mass killings should allow his   armies to proceed in all ruthlessness without fear of judgment.   We might think of those words in considering how little attention   in our history books is given to our presidents? very limited   roles in standing up to atrocities overseas. ? ?   And yet now as Obama?s presidency winds down and a ceasefire   begins to take effect Syria that Washington played no role in   negotiating it?s becoming clear that the loss of life and   the humanitarian crisis represent just the first of many   consequences that historians will have to assess as they ask how   the United States under Obama?s leadership chose to deal or   not to deal with the Syrian Civil War. And if historians tend to   give presidents a pass on failing to arrest slaughter they are   not so generous in evaluating the loss of American influence   around the world. ? ?   Right now the apparent loss of that influence seems to loom   newly large. The brutal   assault in December   crushed the Syrian resistance in its main holdout city Aleppo   calling into question whether the rebel forces will still be able   to carry on any insurrection at all. ? ?   President Bashar   is gathering with the despots of   Russia Turkey and Iran to draw up the terms of resolution   pointedly excluding the United States and the United Nations.   Vladimir Putin seems high in his saddle. ? ?  ? ?   For years Obama has insisted that Syria isn?t of great strategic   importance to the United States. But that judgment represents not   just a break from decades of geostrategic thinking but a gamble   of considerable risk. If Obama is wrong his miscalculation could   have massive implications. Should Russia displace the United   States as the region?s preeminent great power it will affect   America?s access to energy its ability to fight terrorism its   capacity to ensure Israel?s survival and its relationship with   states like Turkey Iran and Saudi Arabia. ? ?   Equally important are the implications of Obama?s Syria policy on   Europe?s immigration crisis. For decades the continent has   struggled with mixed results to assimilate Muslim arrivals from   the Middle East and Africa many of whom come bearing sharply   alien cultural values. ? ?   But the new waves of Syrian refugees unleashed by the failure to   contain the civil war there has now created a crisis of   unparalleled magnitude. Countries from Turkey and Hungary to   Germany and France have been thrown into turmoil. Cultural   tensions escalated empowering   nationalist parties   across the continent and contributing to Britain?s vote to leave   the European Union. ? ?   In the United States this past year Donald Trump amplified his   own pandering to   sentiment with new worries about an   influx of Syrian refugees  ?   stoking   fears. Around   the world it seems the rise of noxious populist currents can be   traced at least in part to the deepening of the immigration   crises by the Syrian war. ? ?  ? ?   Yet a third result of Obama?s ineffectuality lay in the rise of   the Islamic State a terrorist organization even more     and bent on conquest than the al Qaeda fragments   from which it sprang. Obama obviously did not create the Islamic   State contrary to Donald Trump?s absurd   slanders.   But his administration was laggard in countering its gathering   strength. ? ?   Although the terrorist outfit is on the defensive now it   continues to orchestrate deadly strikes in Europe and   indirectly to inspire   attacks in the United States   guaranteeing that terrorism will remain a major threat on both   continents for years to come. ? ?   Fourth the failure to contain the Islamic State early on also   forced the United States to change its strategy in Syria. Turning   his attention from Assad Obama now chose to direct American   military assistance mainly into the fight against the radical   Islamist group. Among other effects this reorientation of   American policy made it much less likely  ?   if not impossible  ?     for Obama to deliver on his August 2011 vow that Assad must go. ? ?  ? ?   Fifth and finally it wasn?t only Assad who emerged emboldened.   Fatefully in 2012 Obama had declared that if Assad were to use   chemical weapons he would cross a red line that would require   American military intervention. ? ?   A year later evidence surfaced that Assad did precisely that   firing rockets filled with sarin gas at towns around Damascus. ? ?   But in the face of skeptical congressional opinion at home Obama   backed down from reprisals. Instead he settled for a Russian   proposal that Syria merely dismantle its weapons stockpiles but   face no punishment for its war crimes. ? ?   Obama has made clear that he disdains the concept of   ?credibility?  ?   the idea that the U. S. must follow through on its   commitments lest it get pushed around in the future. But the   reversal of policy in September 2013 on a clearly articulated   principle sent shivers from Seoul to Jerusalem to Tallinn  ?   and   may well have encouraged America?s adversaries including Russia   to test Obama further. ? ?   Putin?s illegal 2014 seizure of Crimea and the ongoing fomenting   of unrest in eastern and southern Ukraine were worrisome enough.   But now evidence suggests that the Russian president played a   direct role in hacking Democratic Party officials? emails in an   effort to tip the scales of the presidential election in favor of   Trump. These disclosures have shattered any claims that Obama   showed sufficient resolve against a formidable confident and   completely immoral rival for geopolitical influence. ? ?  ? ?   How all of this will affect Obama?s reputation in the long run is   difficult to predict. Observers can only speculate recognizing   all the while that we can?t know which elements of Obama?s policy   future historians will emphasize and which they will ignore   which they will esteem and which they will scorn. ? ?   Sadly it seems probable that Obama won?t be judged too harshly   for failing to arrest the carnage in Syria. For all our fretting   inaction in the face of genocide or mass slaughter or   humanitarian disaster has never hurt our presidents much in the   historical reckonings. ? ?   It is true that in the wake of the Holocaust Americans grew   conscious of the sufferings of foreign peoples and of their own   responsibility as citizens of the world?s mightiest nation to   try to do something. Looking at the past through this new lens   even the sainted Franklin D. Roosevelt took a mild hit as   historians learned more about and came to question his failure to   assist the Jewish refugees of Europe to bomb the rail lines to   Auschwitz or otherwise impede or retard Hitler?s killing   machine. ? ?   More recently historians and journalists like Samantha Power   Ben Kiernan and Gary J. Bass directed historians? attention to   other genocides and mass slaughters. Human rights advocates   argued more vociferously that the world?s mightiest nations had a   duty to try to prevent such atrocities. ? ?   But that consciousness peaked in the 1990s and because military   interventionism has fallen out of fashion since the Iraq War it   has been receding. Obama may have sought some solace in   the fact that presidents? reputations have not typically   suffered for inaction in the face of mass slaughter. ? ?  ? ?   They do suffer however for frittering away American power   and prestige. Though Harry Truman wins high marks for his   handling of the communist threat in Europe he and the Democratic   Party were haunted for years by the question following Mao   Zedong?s civil war victory in 1949 of ?Who lost China??  ?     feeding a domestic political environment that arguably made his   successors keener to intervene in Vietnam Laos and elsewhere in   Southeast Asia. ? ?   Similarly Jimmy Carter?s inability to deal effectively either   with the Soviet Union?s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan or the   revolutionary Iranian government?s seizure of 52 American   hostages contributed to his defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980 as   well as to the low esteem in which his foreign policy is held by   scholars. Presidents can?t of course always prevent the   outbreak of conflicts and wars but how they respond to those   wars  ?   and whether the U. S. emerges from them stronger or weaker   and the world safer or more precarious  ?   is a telling measure of   leadership. ? ?   On the other hand as Obama knows well presidents also suffer   for wars gone badly. Lyndon Johnson should be remembered as one   of America?s greatest presidents but his stubborn prosecution of   the Vietnam War despite knowing it was unwinnable has kept him   out of the pantheon of greatness. (It?s possible that when the     Baby Boomers pass from the scene LBJ will be   judged with greater balance and charity.) ? ?   George W. Bush?s invasion of Iraq similarly with all its   disastrous implications is likely to remain the central episode   of his presidency for a long time outranking even his more   successful response to the terrorist attacks of  . ? ?  ? ?   Indeed Obama entering office after Bush?s ruinous adventurism   made the avoidance of another quagmire his primary goal.   Encouraged by national security aides who hailed from the realm   of domestic politics Obama let the fear of crossing antiwar   opinion dictate his path. Yet in treading lightly Obama   misplaced his big stick. ? ?   A conciliator by nature he had reached the presidency on   promises to unite inimical groups  ?     and     whites and blacks  ?   and in his inaugural address he likewise   pledged to bridge the gap with the Arab world. But just as he   wasn?t prepared for the implacability of congressional   Republicans who scorned his outstretched hand in a bid to   bolster their own power so he did not count on foreign   adversaries taking advantage of his aversion to conflict. ? ?   Obama?s Syria legacy won?t be the only factor shaping how   posterity regards his foreign policy. The uneven efforts to wind   down the Iraq and Afghanistan wars the   Iran   nuclear deal the opening to Cuba the weakening of al Qaeda and   other terrorist groups the struggles to revive peace talks   between Israel and the Palestinians  ?   these add up to a mixed and   complicated record whose implications will take time and thought   to untangle. It may be that his focus on building alliances in   Asia will prove despite the collapse of his     Partnership to be of greater   significance than his   misadventures in Syria. ? ?   But for now it seems hard to escape the conclusion that in   correcting for Bush?s overly aggressive foreign policy Obama   went too far in avoiding confrontations and that in that halting   and hesitant approach he wound up neither strengthening his   country?s influence and status nor its power to bring about its   ultimate goal of a safer and more peaceful world. ?

328,64857,Finland just launched an experiment giving 2000 people free money until 2019,Business Insider,Chris Weller,1/3/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   Finland has an ambitious New Year?s resolution in mind:   learn how offering free money for two years helps the unemployed   get back to work. ? ?   Starting January 1 2017 and lasting until 2019 the federal   social security institution Kela will distribute roughly $590   each month to 2 000 jobless Finns. ? ?   Regardless of whether they find work during that period the   money will keep coming in at the beginning of each month  ?   a   trial version of basic income one of the past year?s most   popular theories of how to solve poverty. ? ?   Under universal basic income (UBI) people receive a standard   amount of money just for being alive. By handing out the money to   everyone regardless of their income status UBI advocates say   the system prevents people from falling through the cracks. ? ?   Marjukka Turunen head of Kela?s legal benefits unit says the   experiment in Finland should provide insights on two fronts. ? ?? ?   The first is whether basic income could help clean up Finland?s   messy system of social security. Depending on their specific   needs Turunen says residents could be on one of 40   different benefit systems. Each   benefit  whether it?s for someone who?s   sick unemployed a student or so onis   calculated differently and must be changed when the person?s   status changes. ? ?   ?That??s really a burden for customers and Kela to do all those   status changes? Turunen tells Business Insider. A form of basic   income could mean people just need to apply for one status   indefinitely no changes required. ? ?   The experiment will also provide clues about how people   behave when they?re receiving free money. Skeptics say people   will sit on their couch all day. Proponents claim they?ll   actually use the money to make their lives better. (Limited   evidence  suggests it?s more of the   latter.) ? ?   Turunen suspects the experiment will compel at least a few   wannabe entrepreneurs to make the leap into starting their own   business  ?   a risky proposition in Finland today since   business owners who are forced to close shop don?t receive   unemployment benefits. It?s not unlike the  in most US states. ? ?   ?The system nowadays it??s pretty negative for people who try to   do something  ?   even little  ?   in their lives and get something out   of it? she says. ? ?   A basic income might turn a risky move into a much safer one. ? ?   Turunen doesn?t expect the trial to lead to larger basic income   studies in Finland. The current experiment is   and in a   small country like Finland the cost would be too great. ? ?   But other   experiments are picking up the slack.   Basic income is part of government conversations in Canada   India and the Netherlands. A  run by the Silicon Valley firm Y Combinator is   soon launching in Oakland California and the charity   GiveDirectly has launched a massive  ? ?   Turunen for her part expects basic income to continue gaining   in popularity if the data from those experiments keeps coming   back positive.  ? ?   ?Some people might stay on their couches and some might go to   work? she says. ?We don??t know yet.? ?

Scarborough the former Republican congressman lambasted the   reporter Sopan Deb for pushing what he called ?fake news? and   for ?making up facts.? ? ?   Scarborough insisted he was only at the event for a brief amount   of time before it began. He said he was attempting to set up an   interview with Trump.

Deb who had covered Trump on the trail for CBS News had   originally posted a screenshot from  detailing the New Year??s Eve gala. Haberman wrote   that the hosts were in attendance but did not categorize   their appearance as having ?partied? with Trump. ? ? ? ? ?t?t?tMorning Joe?s hosts partied with Trump last night at   . Last year Trump publicly thanked them for support.   ? ? ?t?t?tPartied? You?re very good at pushing fake news. You should write for CNN. Apparently making up facts is fine if you?re writing about us.  ? ? ? ? ?t?t?tLast year Trump publicly thanked David Axelrod for his support. Stop being such a hack.  ? ? ?t?t?tOne of the more entertaining aspects of media coverage of media is how so many who blast Trump for half truths attack us with half truths.  ? ? ?t?t?tLast year I said Trump?s campaign was racist xenophobic and disqualifying. But be snide while making facts up. Partied? Not even close.  ? ? ?t?t?tYeah. I?m tired of hacks attacking politicians for lies and false narratives and then doing the same to us.  ? ? ?t?t?tDoes  know that you just make shit up on your twitter feed?  ? ? ?t?t?tWow. He says he chases Trump for CBS. You mean he even lies on his Twitter bio? I?m not surprised.  ? ? ?t?t?tYou?re defending a guy who lied about me and you?re telling me to be careful? I think you have that backwards. You be careful. Facts matter.  ? ? ? ? ?t?t?tAgreed! Facts matter: so you weren?t at    on New Years Eve? You called it fake news so let?s get this right.  ? ? ?t?t?tI imagine you repeated that last night at    . Before the ball dropped maybe even.  ? ? ? ? ?t?t?t1. I ?partied? last night by watching Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters with my kids. Then watched the Mariah Carey dumpster fire. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t2. Around 7pm I had a preset meeting with PEOTUS before his party trying to set up an interview (much like reporters at CBS & NYT do. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t3. The event was black tie. Both Mika and I were in casual clothes did not attend the party and left before any ?partying? began. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t4. Nothing that Mika and I did in setting up this meeting was any different than what all good reporters and news hosts try to do daily. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t5. Anyone suggesting otherwise is a hypocrite who ignores what great journalists from Ben Bradlee to Tom Brokaw have done for years. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t6. I hope we get the interview. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t7. Stop lying about us. ?t?t? ? ?t?t?t8. Happy New Year??t?t? ? ? ? ?t?t?tI can?t think of a presidential candidate who thanked Brokaw and Bradlee for their support but I?m just a liar who makes up news.  ? ?   An enraged Scarborough continued to take aim at Deb posting a   roughly 20 tweets subsequently throughout Sunday. Some took issue   with Deb. Others took aim at those siding with the CBS News   reporter such as Brian Fallon the former campaign spokesman for   Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. And   more were posted to further his defense of attending the   event which he claimed was only for an extremely brief period   and while he was wearing street clothes. ? ? ? ? ?t?t?tSo you double down when you get caught in a lie. How. ..interesting.  ? ? ?t?t?tYes. You lied. And you are digging a deeper whole. Trump also thanked Axelrod. Stop. Digging. You?re embarrassing yourself.  ? ? ?t?t?tIn street clothes. We made the radical decision to follow the path provided by the Secret Service. The pic was in front of metal detectors.  ? ? ?t?t?tYeah. If you define a national treasure as someone who likes lying about others.  ? ? ?t?t?tI don??t know about you but journalists I know ?show up? when the scheduler sets the time. It stops one from being restrained by the USSS.  ? ? ?t?t?tHow?s Wisconsin in the fall? Oh wait. Never mind.  ? ? ?t?t?tBtw my issue is not with your story. It??s with the mischaracterization of it by someone else that we were ?partying.? All good.  ? ?   On Monday Haberman posted a photo of Scarborough from the event   along with other photos she had received. This   prompted Scarborough to continue his lengthy tweetstorm on   the subject. He continued taking shots at Deb and other prominent   reporters. ? ? ? ? ?t?t?tMore  ? ? ?t?t?tThis sure looks like an ideal location to have a journalistic meeting about an interview on NYE . Look forward to seeing the result.  ? ? ?t?t?tGreat journalistic work on your part. This is critical to America and the world. I??m ?behind a wine glass? for 30 seconds. Good God!  ? ? ?t?t?tMore: Maggie Haberman did not try to contact me before putting me in a story saying I was a ?reveler? at Trump??s NYE party. I was not.  ? ? ?t?t?tSeveral reporters said you should??ve called to confirm I was a ?reveler? at a party I did not attend was not invited to & not dressed for.  ? ? ?t?t?tI do have an issue with one NYT reporter painting me in a false light without calling me & a future NYT reporter adding another false fact.  ? ? ?t?t?tPick. Up. The. Phone. And. Ask. I?m went where the USSS directed me to the foot of the stairs. I?m standing with the PEOTUS going upstairs.  ? ? ?t?t?tSomeone showed you a picture. You email and text me when you have questions. You should?ve done it in this situation and checked your story.  ? ? ?t?t?tOh you?re back. What?s your lie of the day?  ? ? ?t?t?tYou get caught lying then double down and triple down. You know the truth and yet you just can?t stop sending out snide tweets. Wow.  ? ? ?t?t?tIs this what Bill Clinton meant when he said we?re in a   world?  ? ? ?t?t?tFacts are stubborn things. ?t?t? ?   Haberman asked Scarborough in her own series of tweets about what   had changed since the night before when he suggested he was   fine with her story. She also said it??s ?known? that Scarborough   and Trump have a relationship. ? ? ? ?  I ask again   what changed since last night when you were fine with it? ?t?t? ?  you had no issue with the description last night or the story. Your issue was with Sopan. What changed? ?t?t? ?  There is one person turning this into a thing and it isn??t me. As I noted last night ?partied? was not my word. ?t?t? ?  You?re in a photo standing among revelers. I?m not sure what?s inaccurate. I also didn?t and don?t think it?s a big deal. ?t?t? ?   and for record I still don?t think this is a big deal. He?s got a relationship with Trump and it?s known. ?t?t?

ISTANBUL (Reuters)   Shot in the arm and slumped behind a table   Francois   played dead as the gunman walked through the   exclusive Istanbul nightclub shooting the wounded as they lay on   the ground. ? ?   Like most of the 39 people killed at a New Year?s party in Reina   a   for the Turkish jet set and moneyed foreigners the   Lebanese radio and TV graduate was a visitor to Istanbul   enjoying a city reputed in the Middle East for its diversity and   tolerance. ? ?   ?He shot one shot so we thought   I thought   it was some angry   or drunk man . .. But a few seconds later we heard a machine   gun? Asmar told Reuters from his hospital bed. ? ?   ?I was hiding behind the table sitting on the floor but my   shoulder must have been exposed. He was shooting us on the floor   . .. I acted dead so he didn??t keep shooting me? he said. ? ?   The lone gunman still at large shot dead a police officer and a   civilian at the door before walking in and opening fire at   random. Witnesses said he shouted ?Allahu Akbar? (God is   Greatest). Islamic State claimed responsibility. ? ?   ?As soon as he entered the club he started firing and he didn??t   stop. He fired   for 20 minutes at least? said Younis   Turk a French citizen of Turkish origin. ? ?   ?We thought that there were several of them because it just   didn??t stop. And there was some kind of bombing as well he threw   some explosives? he said. ? ?   The club was a gathering point for many nationalities that night.   Victims included an Indian Bollywood film producer a Turkish   waiter a Lebanese fitness trainer and a Jordanian bar owner. ? ?   According to a forensics report quoted by the Milliyet newspaper   some of the victims were shot at very close distance or even at     range. ? ?   Mehmet Yilan 36 a barman at Reina for 12 years said the   attacker deliberately targeted the most crowded areas of the   club which sits on the shore of the Bosphorus in Ortakoy an   Istanbul neighborhood packed with cafes and restaurants. ? ?   ?He stormed in and immediately headed for the people to the left   which is always more crowded . .. I wonder if he came here before   because he seemed to know where to go? Yilan said describing   how his manager yelled at people to run. ? ?   ?He was shooting randomly but aiming for their upper bodies. He   didn??t want to just injure them.? ? ?   Yilan escaped into a back room with five customers and two other   bar staff then went downstairs to a terraced area on the edge of   the water. Despite the icy snowy weather some people jumped   into the water to escape the gunfire. ? ?   ?He kept shooting all throughout. I called for our boat which   transfers our customers but he kept firing toward the sea too.   The boat couldn??t approach? Yilan said. ? ?   He spoke to Reuters at the funeral of his colleague Fatih   Cakmak a security guard who worked at the club and had survived   a suicide bombing targeting police at a soccer stadium a few   kilometers away just three weeks earlier. ? ?  ? ?   Lito German 47 a Filipino living in Saudi Arabia who works in   marketing was in Istanbul for the first time with his wife and   daughter and was approaching the club as the attack began. ? ?   ?We were about 100 metres away and started seeing people fleeing   toward us. Most were very well dressed though many were barefoot   and looking shaken and scared? he said. ? ?   ?We were actually meant to go to another club but we didn??t want   to be in a very big place due to security issues and we found   Reina by googling Istanbul??s best night club. We thought the most   expensive club would have better security.? ? ?   Armored police vehicles rushed to the scene as more and more   people came running out he said. ? ?   Among the dead were Abis Rizvi 49 a Bollywood producer who was   in the midst of making his second film and Khushi Shah a   fashion designer in her 20s both from Mumbai. The Indian   government said it was making arrangements to help the families   as they come to Turkey to collect the bodies. ? ?   Lebanon sent a plane to carry back the remains of three of its   citizens who were among the dead. ? ?   Elias Wardini 26 a personal trainer had posted a picture on   Instagram a few hours before the attack posing in the Istanbul   snow with another Lebanese victim in her twenties Rita Shami. ? ?   The club?s owner Mehmet Kocarslan said police had taken   extraordinary security measures in the   to the New Year in   neighborhoods on the Bosphorus shore around Ortakoy. ? ?   The U. S. embassy had warned of potential attacks on areas   frequented by foreigners but Kocarslan said there had been no   specific threat against his club in particular and that many of   the warnings had been  . ? ?   ?I really don??t know how this demon I can??t even call him a   terrorist was able to reach here despite all this intelligence   and extraordinary security measures? he said. ? ?   The incident bore echoes of an attack by militant Islamists on   Paris?s Bataclan music hall in November 2015 that along with   assaults on bars and restaurants killed 130 people. ? ?   ?When they??re determined they??re determined and there??s nothing   to do? said Turk who was visiting from France. ? ?   ?That doesn??t mean that I won??t be coming anymore.

But   ?Apprentice? is a different animal for Polizzi. ? ?   ?I had never even watched the show before. I had heard of it but   I never figured I?d be on it?

Can you think of an example of a retailer that was successfully turned around? ?? ?Buffett also compared it to his previous experience investing in retail in the 1970s.

You may be one of those people who sees January 1 as the perfect   opportunity for a   resolution. ? ?   But there??s a good chance that resolution could do more harm   than good said  a social psychologist at Harvard Business School and   author of the book ?.? ? ?   ?We??re really bad at setting reasonable goals? Cuddy told   Business Insider in 2014. And when we don??t meet an unreasonable   goal we fill ourselves with feelings of anxiety and lower our    . ? ?   In ??   she explores how being authentic to our ?true selves? is . ? ?   She told Business Insider there are four common mistakes   with New Year?s resolutions. ? ?? ?   ?People are making absolute statements about what they??re going   to do and that??s setting them up for failure immediately? Cuddy   said ?because they??re not always going to go to the gym   three times a week.? ? ?   For that example you may start to religiously work out at the   gym but at some point in the year there may be a period where   the flu keeps you in bed for a week or a few days when you need   to set aside your plans for the sake of your job or family. ? ?   On the other hand it??s just as unhelpful to come up with a vague   and distant goal such as ?I??m going to get a job? because   there??s nothing to latch onto. ? ?   People ?tend to focus on things they want to change about   themselves and things they dislike about themselves? Cuddy said. ? ?   When you do this ?you??re eliciting in yourself negative   emotions. Some negative emotions are motivating but for the most   part they??re not? she explained. ? ?   If you say ?I??m going to stop eating junk food? to use an   example you??re denigrating yourself before even getting started.   You??re better off framing your goal as ?eating healthier? so that   you??ll remain motivated and optimistic. ? ?   ?If you??re focused on walking 100 miles and you??re just   constantly focused on that number 100 miles and trying to track   your progress it??s going to be pretty friggin?? demoralizing most   of the way? Cuddy said. ?You??re going to feel like a failure for   so much of that because the comparison is between where I am now   versus where I want to be.? ? ?   And finally it?s a bad idea to incorporate other people and   moments of luck into your  . ? ?   If you?re going for a promotion at work you?ll be doing yourself   a favor by focusing on steps along the way related to your   performance. But starting off with the idea that you?re a failure   if you don?t get the position disregards plenty of factors beyond   your control such as the mindset of your boss and any other role   changes within the company. ? ?   In ?Presence? Cuddy advocates for ?? a process of   constantly setting small goals in lieu of large ones. ? ?   And while she is not a fan of grandiose New Year?s resolutions   she said she can still appreciate that people want to use January   1 as a symbolic day to start with a goal as long as it?s one   that allows room for   and doesn?t cause too much   stress. ? ?   Cuddy said that one of her goals last year was ?to fall in love   with running? avoiding any specific number of miles or pace   times. She started with a simple   to reach a jogging   pace where she would still be able to carry a conversation   without getting winded and started building from there. ? ?   As a natural byproduct of this approach her pace began to pick   up. And she didn?t even have to shame herself into getting into   better shape. ? ? A version of this story ran in 2015. ?

When he doesn??t we will   resist.? ? ?   Schumer said the new Senate would be an ?accountability Congress?   that ?works to make sure? Trump keeps his campaign promises to   ?truly make America great.? ? ?   ?But we??ll fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser   instincts that diminish America and its greatness  ?   instincts   that have too often plagued this country and his campaign.? ? ?? ?   Some of those specific promises he said include increasing the   nation?s GDP growth in excess of 5% bringing down unemployment   getting tough on China protecting Social Security and Medicare   and pushing an infrastructure package. ? ?   Schumer also criticized Trump for seeming ?to be marching   lockstep with a bullying dissembling autocrat who has caused a   great deal of trouble around the globe and here in America   Vladimir Putin? and said Democrats would respond if Trump   doesn??t select a ?mainstream? justice to fill the Supreme Court   seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia who died last February. ? ?

He   promised to change the way America operates to oppose elites   drain the swamp and pay attention to working families.? ? ?

So far it still looks   rigged. Too many of his Cabinet picks support the same     doctrinaire positions that many in the Republican   Party have held for years  ?   policies that the American people   have repeatedly rejected.? ? ?   Trump??s presidency ?will not succeed? if he adopts ? ?   policies Schumer said. ? ?   Schumer then took aim at Trump??s persistent use of Twitter   saying that ?making America great again requires more than 140   characters per issue? and that ?America cannot afford a Twitter   presidency.? ? ?   ?There??s nothing wrong with using Twitter to speak to the   American people? he said. ?It??s a good use of modern media. But   these issues are complex and demand both careful consideration   and action. We cannot tweet them away.? ? ?   ?Tweeting ??very smart?? to Vladimir Putin for ignoring American   sanctions is no foreign policy? Schumer added later. ?America   does not conduct foreign policy by tweet least of all by   flattering Putin after our intelligence agencies have confirmed   that Russia interfered in our election.? ? ?   Trump recently told Schumer  that he was a bigger fan of   the New York Democrat than he was of Republican leadership   including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader   Mitch McConnell.

Incoming White House press secretary and communications director   Sean Spicer later added in a conference call with reporters that   Trump??s tweets were a ?question of priorities.? ? ?   ?He says their focus should be on tax reform and healthcare? he   said. ?It??s not a question of strengthening or weakening  ?   it??s a   question of priorities.? ? ?? ?   House Republicans had  a nonpartisan ethics watchdog in a     meeting. The lawmakers voted to place the office   under the oversight of the House Ethics Committee which gives   them more control over the independent body tasked with   investigating their behavior. It was a measure that was added to   a larger rules package expected to pass on Tuesday. ? ?   The proposal to gut the ethics office was withdrawn Tuesday   afternoon by unanimous consent. ? ?   The new rules would have eliminated the office?s spokesperson   its ability to investigate anonymous tips its ability to alert   law enforcement if has identified a crime and its authority to   publicly release allegations of wrongdoing a mandate that the   formal House Ethics Committee does not have. ? ?   House Republicans said this was because the public releases had   undermined their own due process in investigations. ? ?

343,64875,It?s time for Trump to come to his senses on nuclear weapons,Business Insider,Dave Mosher,1/4/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   Few words issued by   Donald Trump could matter   more than his recent rhetoric on nuclear weapons. ? ?   ?The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear   capability until such time as the world comes to its senses   regarding nukes? Trump  on December 22 2016. ? ?   The next day he bucked his aides?? : ?Let it be an arms race. We will   outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all? Trump    MSNBC ?Morning Joe? host Mika Brzezinski over   the phone. ? ?   Trump is worried about the nuclear weapons modernization efforts   of Russia which in 2014  a key arms reduction treaty plus the   of North Korea. His   attitude echoes Cold     logic: outmatch your adversaries or risk a     preemptive strike. ? ?   But this line of thinking is exceedingly dangerous in a future US   president. It not only ignores  and threatens to   further implode a global    effort to  it also increases  of a nuclear catastrophe. ? ?   Trump?s push for nuclear proliferation is the    not even worthy of being a last resort. ? ?   Here?s why. ? ? ? ?   Russia currently possesses 7 300 nuclear weapons. The United   States . Together these armaments comprise about  on Earth. By contrast China has   about . ? ?   Less than a quarter of these weapons are actually deployed in the   air on land or at sea  ?   the   ?triad? of defense. Also   an  are smaller ?tactical? devices meant for the   battlefield. (Such devices  as we??ll show shortly.) ? ?   But such caveats make little difference. ? ?   Most US and Russian arms are officially deemed as ?strategic?   such as the   and they tend to be many times more   powerful than the bombs the US dropped on the Japanese cities of   Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Those unprecedented   attacks leveled cities and killed more than 100 000 people. ? ?   Purely looking at the  the US has deployed and   stockpiled enough to destroy every Russian city with a population   greater than 50 000 (about 300 cities altogether) many times   over. Similarly Russia likely has enough to decimate every US   city larger than 100 000 people (also about 300 cities) multiple   times. ? ?   This is the raw essence behind : You won?t destroy us because we can destroy you. ? ?   If establishing such a stalemate is still the  behind the existence of nuclear weapons then the   current US arsenal is more than adequate psychological warfare.   Adding more weapons as Trump suggests would do little to   enhance or change this perceived advantage. ? ?   In fact it?d make a terrifying situation even worse. ? ?  ? ?   Right now hundreds of strategic US nuclear weapons are on   ?  alert? also called ?on alert? or   ?  ?. ? ?   This  means such weapons can be   launched within a few minutes of detecting an adversary?s   preemptive nuclear strike  ?   or a . ? ?   Many strategic weapons like  intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) deployed   across middle America can?t be disabled once they leave a silo. ? ?   Yet no human creation is perfect. You can build the world?s   smartest most seemingly foolproof machine and it will still   contain flaws. In the case of nuclear weapons systems such flaws   run the risk of accidental launch detonation and incredible   loss of life. ? ?   Tallying up nuclear weapons accidents is exceedingly difficult   especially due to their classified nature but information that   has been released is alarming. ? ?   ?[M]any dozens of incidents involving nuclear warheads are known   to have occurred in the United States  ?   and likely many more that   have not been made public? according to  by the Union of Concerned Scientists. It   continued: ?[T]he more of these incidents that occur the greater   is the chance that one of them will lead to a nuclear   detonation.? ? ?     known incidents were ?? or when a nuclear weapon was accidentally launched   fired detonated stolen or lost. Eleven are weapons the US   military never recovered including one of two powerful   thermonuclear bombs it accidentally dropped and nearly detonated   over North Carolina. ? ?   A uranium pit from one of the weapons is still somewhere at the   bottom of a swamp. ? ?  ? ?   Writer Eric Schlosser has chronicled some of these      misadventures in ??. The 2014 book closely follows the story   of a Titan II ICBM that exploded in its silo  that could have laid   waste to Arkansas and nearby states. (The cause? A maintenance   worker who accidentally dropped a tool.) ? ?   In light of Trump??s recent statements Schlosser revisited some   of his book??s material in a recent piece for  in which he described alarming ongoing   technical problems with ?aging and obsolete? nuclear weapons and   their    systems. ? ?   Schlosser also highlighted the risks of being human. Using   Minuteman III system as one example he wrote for The New Yorker: ? ?   National leaders who can order nuclear strikes are also fallible   humans. ? ?   Take Pakistan?s defense minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif for   example. Asif  in late December   after reading (and apparently believing) a fake news article   about Israel threatening his country with nuclear weapons. ? ?   More nukes would increase the chances that a weapons system and   the people behind their operation would fail. It would also   heighten the risk of a weapon especially small tactical ones   . ? ?   Luckily the US is actively working to reduce the chance of   disaster. ? ?  ? ?   During the first presidential debate Trump claimed that ?Russia   has been expanding their  ?   they have a much newer [nuclear   weapons] capability than we do. We have not been updating from   the new standpoint. [. ..] We are not  ?   we are not keeping up with   other countries.? ? ?   While it??s true that Russia is upgrading its weapons partly in   response to sanctions and partly in response to US nuclear   weapons advancements Trump??s assertion that the US ?has not been   updating? and is ?not keeping up? . ? ?   For example Russia does not currently have a working     satellite system; it went offline 2 years ago   . This means the US gets 30 minutes of warning   with an ICBM launch. Russia?s   radar systems   meanwhile can give only a few minutes? notice before a warhead   lands. ? ?   Trump?s   statements on nuclear weapons also suggest   that he does not understand the truly bewildering amount of   taxpayer dollars the US has spent maintaining and improving its   nuclear weapons systems. ? ?   In his book ?? a professor at Middlebury Institute of   International Studies at Monterey calculated how much the US   government spent on nuclear weapons through 1996. ? ?   His conservative estimate is that the country spent at minimum   $5. 8 trillion on nuclear weapons. That?s in     dollars though; in 2016 dollars this amounts to more than $8. 9   trillion. ? ?   Putting this titanic amount of money into perspective Schwartz   told an audience during  at the Brookings Institution: ? ?   Today a similar spending trend continues. ? ?  ? ?   ?The current and planned U. S. investment in nuclear forces is   unrivaled by any other nuclear power? stated  by the Arms Control Association. ? ?   Business Insider has  to the fact that the US plans to   spend more than  to modernize its   nuclear arsenal. (The government pegged the cost at  over 20 years but these estimates aren?t   realistic according to several .) ? ?   The nuclear triad modernization program requested by President   Barack Obama endeavors to refurbish aging weapons systems   improve reliability narrow targeting lower the risk of   malfunctions and  the number of deployed    weapons. ? ?   Any call to expand the US nuclear arsenal while failing to   address this  as Trump did throughout the 2016 election and   continues to as   belies a vast government   expenditure and suggests a worrisome ignorance or dishonesty. ? ?   The effects of this program could extend well beyond US and   Russian borders too. ? ?  ? ?   Proliferation can occur even when the total number of nuclear   weapons decreases. ? ?   Despite both the US and Russia taking thousands of warheads   offline since 2010 (as part of the )   some experts believe the arms race Trump seeks  under Obama?s watch. A primary concern   surrounds two new tactical weapons the US military plans to   build. ? ?   The first is a new   nuclear cruise missile. Former   UK defense secretary Philip Hammond has said such weapons    to enemies and   adversaries so their existence could lead to confusion that ends   in nuclear war. ? ?   The second  ?   the US military?s  design  ?   is perhaps more troubling in   that it might lead to routine use of nuclear weapons. While   billed as an upgrade many experts . ? ?   The   will  bombs that simply fell to target with a   precision of about   feet. The  however will have new   fins and   thrusters to guide them to a target with a precision of less than   100 feet. Their explosions will be adjustable too so the   military can detonate them at yields several times greater down   to several times less than the first atomic bombs. ? ?   The Federation of American Scientists and former US military   leaders say such features make tactical weapons . And if tactical weapons are   used in a future conflict the taboo against use of any nuclear   weapons . Some experts even argue that   tactical weapons use could lead to . (Of note: As late as August 2016 one of   Trump?s foreign policy advisors said the incoming president    why the US couldn?t use its   nuclear arsenal.) ? ?   US development of advanced tactical weapons also sends a signal   to other countries: Namely that it?s ok to develop them too. ? ?  ? ?   The most worrisome country for this to happen is not Russia or   even Iran or North Korea but Pakistan (which has 140 nuclear   weapons) in its longstanding and bitter feud with India (which   has 110 nuclear weapons). ? ?   ?Pakistan is outnumbered by India in terms of conventional forces   and is growing increasingly reliant on the threat of the early   use of tactical weapons to deter an attack? journalist Julian   Borger  in 2016. ? ?   If that does happen a   nuclear war could ensue  ?   and   wreck the planet. ? ?   Simulations show that in a war where India and Pakistan each   detonate 50   nuclear bombs over cities more than a   quarter of the Earth?s ozone layer . The surge of incoming ultraviolet   light would wreck ocean ecosystems increase the rate of skin   cancers stunt plant growth and more. ? ?   Also all the carbon from burning cities would partially blot out   the sun  and lead to   a nuclear winter scenario that?d trigger global famine due to   food shortages. ? ?   Adding weapons and increasing their capabilities is a surer path   toward such a catastrophe. There are however ways to steer   humanity away from this alarming risk. ? ?  ? ?   The more nuclear weapons exist and are upgraded the more likely   they are to be used  ?   either intentionally or accidentally  ?   and   expose our species to the risk of an unprecedented nuclear   calamity and possibly a horrifying extinction. ? ?   The solution is not easy but straightforward: Do not expand any   nuclear arsenals. Instead continue to reduce weapons stockpiles   ideally until they are all gone. ? ?   The US can?t ignore ongoing threats from Putin to modernize and   expand Russia?s nuclear arsenal. Nor should we idly sit by while   North Korea works toward its first fully functional nuclear   weapons system including an ICBM capable of reaching the US or   as Pakistan develops tactical weapons  ?   and endeavors to give   commanders the authority to use them on the battlefield. ? ?   Fortunately plenty of   alternatives exist to keep   adversarial countries in check. ? ?   Take cyberwarfare for instance. Given the cleverness and scope   of    a computer virus that took down Iran?s     centrifuges it?s not unreasonable to suggest covert and   preemptive attacks on nuclear weapons systems themselves are   possible or even ongoing. ? ?   ?You??ve either been hacked and not admitting it or you??re being   hacked and don??t know it? retired general James Cartwright told   journalist Joe Cirincione . ? ?   Diplomacy sanctions embargoes and treaties may not always be   popular but they have  ?   so far  ?   effectively prevented countries   like Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. They?ve also helped   reduce weapons stockpiles by more than a factor of 10.   Conventional warfare can also help strip a nation of its nuclear   weapons facilities. ? ?   Most importantly however as Schlosser and others argue it?s   past time that we stop assuming nuclear weapons are safe or   ignorable relics of the Cold War. ? ?   Instead we all need to have frank and honest discussions  ?   in   our homes at work and with elected officials  ?   about the   reality of nuclear weapons including their numbers risks cost   and imminent threat to the future of humanity. Every weapon we   dismantle is one step farther away from the worst kind of mishap   imaginable. ? ?   Trump is known to change his mind and for the sake of my   daughter?s future and the rest of America?s I certainly hope   that he comes to his own senses on this issue. His  and  places him a unique position to lead   potentially powerful bilateral diplomacy and arms reductions   efforts. ? ?   If he can pull it off there?d almost certainly be   ?   and at least one indelibly positive   historical legacy  ?   waiting for him. ?

To compete chains like Applebee?s have attempted to   copy   competitors by updating restaurant designs and   building out their lunch and takeout businesses. So far the   changes have not resulted in increased sales. ? ?   In addition to competing with   chains     chains have to win over consumers who increasingly are choosing   to eat at home as grocery prices plummeted in 2016. ? ?   ?The already challenged restaurant industry has been hit with   slowing overall economic growth and the gap between the cost of   dining at home compared to dining out?

The North American marijuana market posted $6. 7 billion in   revenue in 2016 up 30% from the year before according to a new   report from  a leading publisher of cannabis   market research. ? ?   The   green rush shows no sign of slowing down. ? ?

Tom   Adams editor in chief of Arcview Market Research said in a   statement. ? ?   Adams who recently joined Arcview after a long stint as a market   researcher says the booming cannabis industry reminds him of a   time when   internet gave way to broadband which delivered   faster ?always on? internet access. ? ?   The number of Americans with broadband internet access jumped   from   ?   when about half of US adults were online  ?   to   70% in 2013 according to the Pew Research Center. ? ?   ?What broadband changed for the internet was a kind of remarkable   parallel to legalization for cannabis? Adams told Business   Insider. ?We saw what had been a $5 billion industry  ?   like this   one  ?   in North America take off at that point on new growth   spurts.? ? ?   In the case of the cannabis boom Arcview CEO Troy Dayton credits   legalization with reeling in the stigma against the plant and   bringing new users to the market. ? ?  ? ?   In Colorado Washington and Oregon where recreational use was   legal before 2016 consumer spending on cannabis was up 62%   between 2015 and September 2016 according to Arcview. ? ?   2016 was a big year for legalizing weed. Seven US states   legalized cannabis in some form on Election Day. California the     economy in the world became the biggest domino to   fall with the passage of Proposition 64. Much of the West Coast   is now a legal enclave for recreational pot. ? ?   Dayton says the sudden popularity of alternative ingestion   methods  ?   such as   topicals sprays and edibles  ?   also   fueled growth. Consumers who would never smoke a joint are   finding relief in other products which offer a wide array of   tastes strengths and experiences. ? ?   ?It??s one of the major reasons that people are going to leave the   underground market to go to the aboveground market. It??s about   variety? Dayton told Business Insider. ?You just can??t get these   products on the underground market.? ? ?   While the green business could achieve 25% growth      through 2021 as new recreational markets come online Adams says   legal weed is never going to be as big as the     internet access market. But their sustained growth rates are   comparable. ? ?   Adams and Dayton predict a great number of countries will   legalize pot in the next 10 to 15 years. ? ?   ?So when you look at the global market the world has never seen   something that will have such consistent growth over such a long   period of time as the cannabis industry?

When it comes to aromatic and flavorful food Indian cuisine   . ? ?   So why is it so underrepresented in America? ? ?   According to  there are over 40 000 Chinese   restaurants across the nation and roughly the same number of   Mexican restaurants  ?   yet there are only about 5 000 Indian   restaurants. ? ?   Many point to the need for fine culinary skills to create quality   Indian cuisine which results in higher prices. Most Americans   don?t expect to pay above a certain price level for food which   leaves only subpar Indian food as an option. And once you?ve had   bad Indian food it takes a while to want to roll the dice again. ? ?   But despite this Indian food is making inroads in the American   palate. Millennials generally have  and Nation?s Restaurant News   predicts Indian food will be one of the . ? ?   This includes more than just upscale joints  ?   some major chains   are starting to dabble in Indian flavors. ? ?   Nation?s Restaurant News reports that curry is taking over. Tava   Kitchen a chain in the Bay Area is serving up fragrant     burritos wraps bowls and salads.  a   chainlet in the Denver region is getting a lot of buzz for its   Southern Indian cuisine.

352,64887,The battle lines are being drawn in the fight over Obamacare,Business Insider,Bob Bryan,1/5/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   The fight over the future of the Affordable Care Act better   known as Obamacare kicked off in earnest Wednesday with   both Democratic and Republican leaders laying out their cases for   saving and dismantling the healthcare law respectively. ? ?   The day after Senate Republicans introduced a  through the   budget reconciliation process lawmakers met privately with their   party?s leaders who pushed their plans for the future of   healthcare in America. ? ?   Vice   Mike Pence and Obama met with congressional   leaders of their parties on Wednesday to map out the road ahead.   Each side ended the day with a more   sales pitch. ? ?   Much like Republicans??   promise to ?repeal and   replace? the ACA the GOP??s new path forward is marked by two   distinct messages. ? ?   On one hand Republicans emphasized that the Obamacare markets   are collapsing on their own and must therefore be overhauled. On   another GOP leaders stressed the need for a ?smooth?   transition to a new plan that may not come as quickly as many of   their constituents likely expect. ? ?   Republicans leaders have been attacking the healthcare law for   years with leaders such as  House Speaker  and  all saying   repeal of the law would be an immediate priority for the new   Congress. ? ?   That   attitude seems to have cooled in recent days   as Republicans leaders have cited the need to ensure that the   over 20 million people that have gained healthcare through the   ACA retain their coverage. ? ?   Ryan cited the need for a ?stable? transition to a replacement   during a press conference Wednesday while Pence stressed ?an   orderly and smooth transition to a   healthcare reform   system.? ? ?   Other Republicans lawmakers including Sens. Rand Paul and   John McCain also emphasized the need to be cautious on repeal   without a replacement plan in place. ? ?   They were echoed by Trump who  cautioned   Republicans to ?be careful? to make sure Democrats ?own the   failed Obamacare disaster? instead of having any future problems   pegged on the GOP. ? ?   Pence cited the increases in  and  as reasons the law needed to be   replaced. Republicans as a whole argued that even if there are   disruptions or kinks Obamacare was failing anyway so change   will be necessary. ? ?   ?We??re talking about people??s lives. We??re talking about   families? Pence said. ? ?  ? ?   For their part Democrats made an attempt to lay problems arising   from any tweaking of Obamacare at the feet of Republicans. They   came with a slogan blaring that repeal would ?Make   America Sick Again?  ?   a play on Trump??s ?Make America Great   Again? campaign moniker. ? ?   Additionally Democrats looked to peg any lapses in care or other   disruptions in the healthcare market on the GOP. ? ?   In a press conference Wednesday new Senate Minority   Leader Chuck Schumer cited  that a Republican   plan to repeal the law and delay its replacement would cause   instability in the individual health insurance market and large   price hikes. Schumer said such a process would cause ?chaos? in   insurance markets. ? ?   Obama devoting one of his last days in office to the future of   his signature legislative achievement told Democratic leaders to   start to call any changes ?Trumpcare? and not to ?rescue?   Republicans by compromising on replacement plans . ? ?   Democrats also touted the successes of the law  ?   including    in the history of the country   the provision that prevents insurers from denying coverage based   on a preexisting condition and the elimination of lifetime   limits on coverage. These aspects of the law have   been  ? ?   ?They want to repeal it and then try to hang it on us. Not going   to happen. It??s their responsibility plain and simple?   Schumer said Wednesday. ? ?   The dueling message campaigns come at a time when the American   public remains split over its provisions and its overall future.   The  in December that 49% of   Americans want to expand or keep the ACA as it is now while 43%   of those surveyed preferred to repeal the law entirely or   roll back what it does. ?

356,64891,Speculation is mounting that Mark Zuckerberg wants to serve in government,Business Insider,Alex Heath,1/5/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   Lately Mark Zuckerberg has been acting more like a   statesman than a tech CEO. ? ?   The Facebook founder?s  is to tour the U.

In early 2016 he asked Facebook??s board to  for up to two years according to legal documents. The   documents which are from a shareholder lawsuit against Facebook   indicate that Zuckerberg was  even when one of   his board members called it ?particularly irresponsible.? ? ?   Yet another indication of Zuckerberg?s interest in public   office is a leaked August 2015 email from Facebook COO   Sheryl Sandberg to former Hillary Clinton campaign   chairman John Podesta. ? ?   In the email which was published by Wikileaks Sandberg asks   Podesta to meet with Zuckerberg. She said that Zuckerberg had   been ?meeting with people to learn more about next steps for his   philanthropy and social action.? ? ?   ?As you may know he?s young and hungry to learn  ?   always in   learning mode  ?   and is early in his career when it comes to his   philanthropic efforts? Sandberg wrote to Podesta. ? ?   ?He?s begun to think about   he might want to shape   advocacy efforts to support his philanthropic priorities and is   particularly interested in meeting people who could help him   understand how to move the needle on the specific public policy   issues he cares most about? she continued. ?He wants to   meet folks who can inform his understanding about effective   political operations to advance public policy goals on social   oriented objectives (like immigration education or basic   scientific research).? ? ?   Zuckerberg would end up announcing his philanthropic fund the   Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with his wife later that year. ? ?  ? ?   If Zuckerberg did decide to step into public office he could   very well choose be a cabinet member of some kind rather than run   for president. His proposal to serve for up to two years without   losing control of Facebook is obviously not long enough for a     presidential term. ? ?   But as  Zuckerberg could technically serve   in government for more than two years if he still owns at   least 30% of the capital shares in Facebook that he   had as of June 2016 and discusses it with the   company?s board of independent directors. ? ?   If he owns less than 30% of the capital shares he had   in June 2016 and wants to serve for more than two years he has   to get approval from the majority of Facebook?s independent   directors according to the company?s filing with the SEC. ? ?   Facebook did not immediately return a request for comment about   Zuckerberg?s potential political aspirations. ? ?   In his role as one of the most influential CEOs in tech   Zuckerberg has already had various   interactions with governments.

357,64892,Mexico spooked by Trump?s leverage in keeping jobs in the US after Ford?s pivot,Business Insider,,1/5/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   Ford Motor Company?s cancellation of plans to build a $1. 6   billion auto manufacturing plant in San Luis Potosi has sounded   alarms throughout Mexico. ? ?   Even as the country is being rocked by rowdy nationwide protests   against a Jan. 1 gasoline price hike the Ford news led the front   pages of Mexico?s most influential newspapers on Wednesday and   they tied the development directly to   Donald   Trump. ? ?   ?Trump leaves Mexico without 3 600 jobs? read the headline on El   Universal. ?Ford??s braking jolts the peso? said Reforma   referring to the Mexican currency??s nearly 1 percent slump   following the news. ? ?   ?The jobs created in Mexico have contributed to maintaining   manufacturing jobs in the United States which otherwise would   have disappeared in the face of Asian competition? the Mexico   Economy Department said. ? ?   Mexicans have been nervous about Trump?s tough rhetoric toward   their country including disparaging remarks about immigrants who   come to the U. S. illegally and vows to wall off the border and   renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement upsetting   ties with what is by far Mexico?s largest trading partner. ? ?   Two weeks before inauguration the scuttling of the planned Ford   factory and Trump??s pressure on General Motors should be a   ?    call? said Mexico analyst Alejandro Hope. ? ?   It shows ?how much actual leverage Trump has within specific   companies which is far greater than what Mexican elites thought   until recently? Hope said. ?They claimed that at the end of the   day economic interests would prevail over political messaging.   That??s clearly not the case.? ? ?  ? ?   In an editorial El Universal also recalled the deal Trump struck   in December with Carrier to keep 800 of 1 300 jobs at an Indiana   furnace factory from being sent to Mexico in return for millions   of dollars in tax incentives. It also implicitly criticized the   Mexican government?s response to the incoming administration. ? ?   ?Mexico loses thousands of jobs with no word on a clear strategy   for confronting the next U. S. government which has presented   itself as protectionist and especially ? the paper   wrote. ?Trump will try to recover as many U. S. companies that   have set up in Mexico as possible. He will try to make them   return at whatever cost through threats or using public   resources.? ? ?   ?Ford??s decision is indicative of what awaits the economies of   both countries? the daily La Jornada said. ?For ours a severe   decrease in investment from our neighboring country and for the   U. S. a notable increase in their production costs.? ? ?  ? ?   Hope said more decisions like Ford??s are likely to come. And   while the loss of a single planned plant probably does not   fundamentally change the U. S.  economic relationship ?it   certainly shows that the idea that the status quo was entrenched   was false.? ? ?   ?This should put us on notice that when he says that he wants to   renegotiate NAFTA he means it? Hope said. ?

The Raiders used the pick to   draft Cook who will make his first NFL start in the playoffs. ? ?  ? ?   The Cowboys later used a   pick to draft Prescott.   However  Chip Kelly   wanted the 49ers to draft Prescott earlier but was shot down by   GM Trent Baalke. It?s unclear if the 49ers were targeting   Prescott in the fourth round but they drafted cornerback Rashard   Robinson two spots ahead of Prescott who then went to the   Cowboys at pick No. 135. ? ?   This shuffling of players could have led to wildly different   results this season. Denver going into the draft had a   quarterback problem with only Mark Sanchez and Trevor Siemian on   board. Though Siemian won the job in training camp if they   hadn?t drafted Lynch would they have pulled the trigger on trade   for say Colin Kaepernick who they were rumored to be   targeting? ? ?   Nobody could have predicted the injuries to Tony Romo in   preseason or to Derek Carr in Week 15 but the backup   quarterbacks could have made this season a different story. Who   could be starting for the Raiders in the Wild Card game if they   had not traded up to draft Connor Cook? ? ?   Or if the Cowboys drafted Lynch or Cook would they still be in   the position they?re in today with one of them filling in for an   injured Tony Romo. Would Romo have taken over again if Lynch or   Cook were running the show? Would the 49ers have possibly   competed for a playoff spot in Prescott was their quarterback? ? ?   These are all hypotheticals that could be asked each year but   this year they feel especially pertinent. This year things fell   just right for Prescott to have a historic rookie season while   Cook will face a huge first test this Saturday and Lynch will   have to wait for his big moment. And the 49ers are still   searching for answers at quarterback. ?
364,64900,Warren Buffett looks for these 3 traits in people when he hires them,Business Insider,,1/5/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of  . ? ?   But his wisdom runs much deeper than just investing. ? ?   Warren Buffett is also an incredible businessman and manager and   it?s really these qualities  ?   in addition to his investing skill    ?   that?s helped him build  into one of the largest and   most profitable companies in the world. ? ?   But despite what most people think he didn?t do it alone. ? ?   Warren Buffett had a lot of help from people like his partner    and he?s been able to hire   recruit and incentivize amazing managers like  and . ? ?   How has Warren Buffett been able to build such a formidable team   and in turn such a successful company? ? ?   The secret lies in what Warren Buffett looks for in people   when he hires them: integrity   intelligence and energy. ? ?   Warren Buffett loves to teach. The following is a ?sermon? that   Buffett has often gives to MBA students when he comes talk   to them  ?   including first at the  (download a transcript of   Buffett?s full lecture ) and again later at the . Here Warren Buffett breaks   down why those three qualities  ?   integrity intelligence and   energy  ?   are so important: ? ? Play one game a little bit with me for just a minute  ?     ? ? I?d like for the moment to have you pretend I?ve made you a   great offer and I?ve told you that you could pick any one of   your classmates  ?   and you now know each other probably pretty   well after being here for a while. You have 24 hours to think it   over and you can pick any one of your classmates and you get 10   percent of their earnings for the rest of their lives. And I ask   you what goes through your mind in determining which one of   those you would pick? You can?t pick the one with the richest   father that doesn?t count. I mean you?ve got to do this on   merit. But you probably wouldn?t pick the person that gets the   highest grades in the class. ? ? I mean there?s nothing wrong with getting the highest grades   in the class but that isn?t going to be the quality that sets   apart a big winner from the rest of the pack. Think about who you   would pick and why. And I think you?ll find when you get through   you?ll pick some individual  ?   you?ve all got the ability you   wouldn?t be here otherwise. And you?ve all got the energy. I   mean the initiative is here the intelligence is here throughout   the class. But some of you are going to be bigger winners than   others. ? ? And it gets down to a bunch of qualities that interestingly   enough are  . I mean it?s not how tall you are. It?s not   whether you can kick a football 60 yards. It?s not whether you   can run the 100 yard dash in 10 seconds. It?s not whether you?re   the best looking person in the room. It?s a whole bunch of   qualities that really come out of Ben Franklin or the Boy Scout   codes or whatever it may be. I mean it?s integrity it?s   honesty it?s generosity it?s being willing to do more than your   share it?s just all those qualities that are  . ? ? And then if you look on the other side of the ledger because   there?s always a catch to these free gifts and genie jokes. So   you also have to  ?   and this is the fun part  ?   you also have to   sell short one of your classmates and pay 10 percent of what they   do. So who do you think is going to do the worst in the class?   This is way more fun. And think about it again. And again it   isn?t the person with the lowest grades or anything of the sort.   It?s the person who just doesn?t shape up in the character   department. ? ? We look for three things when we hire   people. We look for intelligence we   look for initiative or energy and we look for   integrity. And if they don?t have the latter   the first two will kill you because if you?re going to get   someone without integrity you want them lazy and dumb. I mean   you don?t want a spark of energy out of them. So it?s that third   quality. But everything about that quality is your choice. ? ? You know you can?t change the way you were wired much but   you can change a lot of what you do with that wiring. And it?s   the habits that you generate now on those qualities or those   negatives qualities. I mean the person who always claims credit   for things they didn?t do that always cuts corners that you   can?t count on. In the end those are habit patterns and the time   to form the right habits is when you?re your age. I mean it   doesn?t do me much good to get golf lessons now. If I?d gotten   golf lessons when I was your age I might be a decent golfer. ? ?    ? ?   But someone once said ?the chains of habit are too light to be   felt until they?re too heavy to be broken. ? And I see that all   the time. I see people with habit patterns that are     when they?re 50 or 60 and they really can?t   change then they?re imprisoned by them. But you?re not   imprisoned by anything. So when you write down the qualities of   that person that you?d like to buy 10 percent of look at that   list and ask yourself is there anything on that list I couldn?t   do? ? ? And the answer is there won?t be. And when you look at the   person you sell short and you look at those qualities that you   don?t like if you see any of those in yourself  ?   egotism   whatever it may be selfishness  ?   you can get rid of that. That   is not ordained. And if you follow that and Ben Franklin did   this and my old boss Ben Graham did this at early ages in their   young teens Ben Graham looked around and he said ?Who do I   admire?? And he wanted to be admired himself and he said ?Why do   I admire these other people?? And he said ?If I admire them for   these reasons maybe other people would admire me if I behave in   a similar manner. ? And he decided what kind of a person he wanted   to be. ? ? And if you follow that at the end you?ll be the person you   want to buy 10 percent of. I mean that?s the goal in the end and   it?s something that?s achievable by everybody in this room. So   that?s the end of the sermon. ? ?   If you want to get hired by Warren Buffett you just need to   show him that you have three things: integrity intelligence and   energy. ? ? Intelligence ? ?   The intelligence component is obvious  ?   you need the mental   capacity to do the job. But as Buffett points out in his sermon   there are many smart people around (Buffett even notes that every   one of the MBA students he was speaking to were already smart   enough to succeed). But the person ?who you would want 10% of?   isn?t necessarily the person who gets the highest grades. ? ?   In fact Buffett has made this point several times: ? ? ?You don?t need to be a rocket scientist. Investing is not a   game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130   IQ. ? ? ? ?If you are in the investment business and have an IQ of 150   sell 30 points to someone else. ? ? ? Energy ? ?   Having energy is also an obvious choice. (Don?t worry this   doesn?t mean you have to be someone who is jumping up and down   all day  ?   Buffett clarifies that by energy he   means someone who takes initiative). Clearly you   can?t succeed if you?re lazy. You have to take initiative you   have to be entrepreneurial and you have to make things happen  ?     either for yourself or your company. ? ? Integrity ? ?   Integrity is the missing piece of the puzzle. If you want to   become someone who Warren Buffett would hire this is the most   important quality that you should develop. ? ?   Think about it. Would you want to work with someone who is   intelligent and driven but who doesn?t have integrity? Of course   not! In fact that is probably the absolute last person you would   want to work with (*ahem*  ?    ever hear of ? ). Buffett jokes that if someone   doesn?t have integrity then at least you want them to be dumb   and stupid. ? ?   The best part about this quality is that it?s completely    . ? ?   You can?t control your height your looks or how fast you   run. But you can completely control whether or not you have   integrity if you?re honest if you?re generous and if you?re   willing to do more than your fair share. ? ?   The next step toward a successful hire is finding someone   who is driven and shows initiative. Warren Buffett isn?t the   only person who does this. Famous fellow value investor   Mario Gabelli says that he looks for : people who are ?poor hungry and driven. ?   Even legendary basketball coach  looks for  too. ? ?   What I love about Warren Buffett is that he specifically looks   for a third key intangible  ?   integrity. Without it   intelligence and energy don?t matter (and can actually be   harmful). And I?m fairly certain that it?s Buffett  on integrity and   ?   and not just on intelligence   energy and profits  ?   that has helped him and Berkshire Hathaway   become so successful. ?

Language used in the proposed ?bathroom bills?  ?   filed in    on Thursday and    and    earlier this week  ?   mirrors that of North Carolina??s House   Bill 2 a law that polarized the nation and led to  of lost statewide revenue. ? ?

372,64910,Fox News host Tucker Carlson?s on-air war with elitism,Business Insider,Oliver Darcy,1/6/2017,2017,1,,?    ? ? Editor?s note: This story was initially published on December   5 2016. It has been republished below after  on Thursday that Tucker   Carlson will be promoted to the network?s 9 p. m. time slot   to replace outgoing host Megyn Kelly. ? ?   *** ? ?It was the 7 p. m. hour on Fox News and famed New   York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof found himself in the hot   seat forced to defend a column he had authored in part about     Donald Trump?s supporters. ? ?   ?I guess what I??m here for is empathy? host Tucker Carlson told   Kristof noting the Times journalist had an extensive background   traveling to some of the most troubled places on the globe. ? ?   ?I??ve never read a column by you that suggests the people in   those places  ?   who support dictators oftentimes  ?   are racists or   bad people? Carlson said as he placed a printed copy of the   column on the studio??s glass desk. ?You would never write that   about a poor person in the third world. But you??re implying that   about your fellow Americans.? ? ?   Kristof rejected Carlson?s characterization of his work but the   newly minted Fox News primetime host who previously hosted shows   on CNN and MSNBC calmly pressed forward. ? ?   ?You??ve thought a lot about the suffering of people in other   countries. You??ve thought a lot about it? Carlson said. ?It   doesn??t seem you??ve thought that deeply about the suffering of   your fellow Americans.? ? ?   For anyone familiar with Carlson the sentiment he was expressing   on his show ?Tucker Carlson Tonight? was not new. His show   which premiered in the week after the election has already   become a standout in Fox News?? nightly programming. ? ?   Carlson a conservative journalist who most recently founded The   Daily Caller a   online publication holds ardent   views about small government excessive regulation and a   multitude of other issues typically shared among Republicans. ? ?   But the issue he perhaps is most passionate about these days cuts   across party lines: He describes it as a distaste for elitism   particularly among political journalists who reside in the Acela   corridor. ? ?   ?What bothers me is the lack of  . I don??t know if I   have ever met a group less   than political reporters?   Carlson told Business Insider in a recent interview. ?They   honestly don??t believe that there are legitimate alternative   views of anything. And like most   and dumb people   they are very very quick to dismiss anything they don??t   understand as crazy.? ? ?   Following Trump?s unforeseen election victory the journalism   community  hoping to   understand how it had failed to see a Trump win on the horizon. ? ?   One of the immediate conclusions was that reporters had become   too encapsulated in some sort of bubble. They had failed to   detect and thus understand the sentiment of Americans residing   in the heartland. ? ?   That was a conclusion with which Carlson wholeheartedly agreed. ? ?   Referencing a widely circulated  in which he suggested   conservative voters were stuck in a bubble and only accepting   news from   sources Carlson said the same was true of   the mainstream media. ? ?  ? ?   ?It??s the mirror image of the world I live in? Carlson said. ?In   Washington no one believes anything unless it comes from The New   Yorker New York Times editorial page or The Washington Post.   There??s not just one bubble.? ? ?   Carlson also threw cold water on some of the other theories that   have been floated by political journalists and analysts aiming to   explain Trump?s victory. ? ?   ?All the explanations have one thing in common? Carlson said.   ?They don??t take voters seriously.? ? ?   ?So whether you believe that the Russians somehow rigged the   system   ?     or you believe that somehow voters were hypnotized by   demagoguery . Or if you think they were   hoodwinked by fake news? he continued. ?All of these are ways of   saying that voters didn??t know what they were doing voters   weren??t making a rational choice.? ? ?   The suggestion voters were too uninformed to make a wise decision   while casting their ballots Carlson posited was exactly the   attitude that blindsided the media this cycle. ? ?   ?What I would say is that clearly voters are mad at the   establishment and have contempt for the establishment. But the   establishment has greater contempt for voters? he said. ?If you   think your average Trump voter in Ohio hates Washington you   should see what Washington thinks about the Trump voter in Ohio.? ? ?   Carlson said that ?the core irony? of the political system is   that ?the people who are running the democracy don??t believe in   democracy.? ? ?   ?That??s why they are calling for a recount that??s why the   financial community called for another election after Brexit and   it??s why the Republican establishment tried to take the   nomination away from Trump at the convention? he explained.   ?Because they are not interested in allowing voters to make these   choices.? ? ?   ?And that??s fine if it??s an oligarchy you can get away with   stuff like this. But if you tell people it??s democracy and then   you can??t as if it isn??t it really gets people mad.? ? ?   One thing that does worry Carlson about the growing distrust of   the media these days is that individuals on various sides of the   political spectrum are moving away from a common fact set in   which they form their opinions. ? ?   Conservatives refuse to trust legacy outlets like CNN and the   Times while liberals are skeptical about reporting from outlets   like Fox News. ? ?   ?You need in order to run a country as diverse as ours a   prominently recognized news source. You do? he explained. ?You   need  ?   if there??s a crisis. And I??ve seen this in other   countries. I saw it in a bunch of countries.   ?     Where there??s a   crisis and nobody can agree on what the basic facts are.? ? ?   ?That??s a source of disunity and that creates chaos and   division? Carlson said. ? ?   The Fox News host continued: ?I hate the mainstream media but   I??m not against the idea of the mainstream media. I am for it   actually. I think it would be nice if there were news   organizations that in the end everybody agreed were on the   level.? ? ?  ? ?   Carlson said however that the   mainstream media   discredited itself this cycle prompting a large chunk of the   country to turn to alternative outlets for their news. ? ?   ?The reason people don??t agree [the traditional media outlets]   are on a level is because they are not on a level? Carlson said.   ?That??s kind of the point.? ? ?   ?Maybe the reason people don??t trust The New York Times is   because maybe it??s not trustworthy. Maybe that??s the point?? he   rhetorically asked. ?So whoever is mad about Breitbart and Alex   Jones  ?   well we wouldn??t have Breitbart and Alex Jones if the   gatekeepers had done their jobs. But they didn??t.? ? ?   Some news outlets following introspection in the aftermath of   the election have suggested they will make changes to better   represent the views of the broader American population. But   Carlson thinks it?s too late. These outlets he said will never   regain the trust of the readers they lost. ? ?   ?It??s over? he bluntly told Business Insider. ? ?   Regular viewers of Carlson?s show know that one institution in   particular has earned his scorn: the   system.   It?s his way of pushing back against what he views as a system   dominated by elites. ? ?   Part of the reason he has taken a keen interest in the     system he said is because he has two children   currently enrolled in college. But he said he was ?also struck by   how very much modern academia resembles the Medieval Church.? ? ?   ?It??s an institution that everyone is required to revere you   send in your tithes all of us are saving money for college we   give more to colleges than our churches and you are not allowed   to ask hard questions you are not allowed to question what   happens there? he explained. ? ?   In the month since his show premiered Carlson has made a habit   of interviewing both students and administrators from various   colleges. In fact his show has a reoccurring segment called   ?Campus Craziness.? ? ?   In one lengthy segment he pressed a Hampshire College student   over why he . In another he grilled Michael Roth the president of   Wesleyan University in Connecticut over his plans to have his   school be a ?sanctuary campus? throughout Trump??s presidency. ? ?   Carlson said journalists ?rarely? seem to ask hard questions   about the people making decisions in the US     system. ? ?   ?If there was a   company and its CEO made a million   dollars a year with subsidized housing and tons of servants   with a guaranteed   contract and a massive payout at the   end who was taking more than half his budget from the taxpayer  ?     the rest of us would feel like we kind of have a right to know   what he??s doing wouldn??t we?? he asked. ?I kind of think we   would!? ? ?Carlson?s show marked the first change to Fox   News? primetime lineup since founding CEO Roger Ailes departed   the network. ? ?   The addition of his program also came as Megyn Kelly considered   by many observers to be the outlet?s most valuable talent    like   Bill O?Reilly and Sean Hannity. ? ?   But Carlson said he has no part in it and insisted the world he   lives in is ?entirely drama free.? ? ?   ?There??s a little cloud of happiness around my head.

In a   punch House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that   Republicans  Planned Parenthood when they try to repeal the   Affordable Care Act more commonly known as Obamacare. ? ?   Thursday morning Planned Parenthood  focused on keeping Republicans   in Congress from gutting the healthcare law and from passing   legislation to ?defund? the organization. ? ?   While politicians have popularized the term ?? when   talking about stripping federal funds for Planned Parenthood the   group??s political communications director Erica Sackin said   this is misleading. ? ?   ?There??s no line item in the budget for Planned Parenthood?   Sackin told Business Insider. ?We??re not funded through the   federal budget bill.? ? ?   Planned Parenthood health centers serve 2. 5 million people each   year nearly   of whom rely on public programs like   Medicaid to pay for their care. When lawmakers pass bills to   ?defund? the organization (as ) those patients then have to pay for   healthcare at Planned Parenthood out of pocket. ? ?   But the  to use Medicaid to   pay for an abortion except in the case of rape incest or if the   mother?s health is endangered. Congress first passed the law in    four years after the Supreme Court ruled women have a   constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. ? ?   So while it may seem as if ?defunding? Planned Parenthood is a   way to prevent abortions Sackin said ?it??s going to affect   people who don??t have anywhere else to go? get care like cancer   screenings. ? ?   According to Planned Parenthood?s most recent  only 3% of the organization?s services are   abortions. Most people are getting birth control or STD tests at   Planned Parenthood clinics: ? ?  ? ?  ? ?   The  when the new   Congress took over with Republicans making their case for   repealing and replacing the ACA and Democrats arguing to save it. ? ?   If Republicans scrap the law  could lose the guaranteed access to  that Obamacare provides. ? ?   But that?s just part of the fight. ? ?

Kelley Robinson the deputy national organizing director for   Planned Parenthood said one in five women will visit the   organization in their lifetimes and that defunding it would be a   ?national health disaster.? ? ?   ?The outpouring of need is so so clear?

375,64913,T-Mobile CEO?s 8 predictions for 2017 include Verizon and Comcast considering merging into ?the ultimate evil corporation of all time?,Business Insider,Richard Feloni,1/6/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?     US CEO John Legere wrapped his 2017 CES presentation   Thursday with a round of predictions complete with crystal ball. ? ?   His predictions for the year include Google entering the wireless   industry to compete with the big four carriers  ?   Verizon   AT&T   and Sprint  ?   and Verizon considering a merger   with cable giant Comcast. ? ?   Here?s what Legere is betting is on the horizon. ? ?   Legere thinks big cable companies like Comcast Cable and Charter   Communications will get into the industry through mobile virtual   network operator (MVNO) deals  ?   an MVNO provides to customers the   wireless service it buys in bulk from the big four carriers. ? ?   Legere promised that if this is the case   won??t   participate in any of these deals and that by CES 2018 Big Cable   will have realized its moves were losses and be in ?full   retreat.? ? ?? ?   ?The future is mobile? Legere said explaining that it only   makes sense a massive tech company like Facebook Amazon or   most likely Google will join the fray to take on the big four.   ?We??ll clean their clocks too? Legere added. ? ?   ?TV isn??t dead? Legere said. It??s just being streamed   across devices. Legere is betting that more than half of all   television shows will be viewed on mobile by the end of the year. ? ?   Legere thinks the satellite service provider missed its window to   enter the wireless industry and will cease to be a standalone   company. ?Dealer next hand of cards please? Legere said.   ?Thanks for playing Charlie!? ? ?   Legere said he is convinced   will beat AT&T and   Verizon in offering customers Gigabit LTE service  ?   think of it   as a step above current 4G LTE but not quite the next big leap:   5G. ? ?   Legere proclaimed that his ?Slow Cooker Sunday? Facebook Live   segments where he prepares a Sunday dinner in his pressure   cooker (?Most of them suck!? he said) will take on channels   like MTV Comedy Central and the Food Network and go from   around 500 000 to 1 million viewers. ? ?   To be clear a view on Facebook counts as three seconds or more   and some   sponsored videos surpass 1 million views on   Facebook already. Legere acknowledged this one was goofy but   suggested his carrier?s impressive social influence would grow   stronger. ? ?   There will be a CEO shuffle where the CEOs of three of the four   major wireless carriers will be replaced Legere said   suggesting without explicitly saying he??s not going to be   one of them. ?I??ll leave it at that!? Legere said. ? ?   Legere has criticized Verizon??s decisions to buy AOL and Yahoo   and thinks that Verizon will consider another choice he sees   as disastrous: merging with Comcast. ? ? ?  ?

A New York City Police Department captain drew backlash Friday   for saying a spike in reported rapes was ?not a trend that we??re   too worried about? because many of the perpetrators were   acquainted with the victims and not strangers. ? ?   The 94th Precinct in the Greenpoint neighborhood in Brooklyn   has seen a 62. 5% increase in reported rapes over the last   year with 10 out of  in 2016 remaining unsolved . ? ?   Police attributed the lack of arrests to the fact that most rapes   were committed by victims? acquaintances adding that women   who reported the attacks often stopped cooperating with   investigators according to DNAinfo. ? ?   ?Some of them were Tinder some of them were hookup sites some   of them were actually coworkers. It??s not a trend that we??re too   worried about because out of 13 (cases) only two were true   stranger rapes? Captain Peter Rose told the website. ? ?   ?Every rape should be investigated. I wish we could do more?   Rose said. ? ?   Rose reportedly made further comments at a community council   meeting Wednesday suggesting that rapes committed by strangers to   the victim were more worrying to police than acquaintance rapes. ? ?   ?They??re not total abomination rapes where strangers are being   dragged off the streets? he said. ? ?   ?If there??s a true stranger rape a random guy picks up a   stranger off the street those are the troubling ones. That   person has like no moral standards? he added. ? ?   Rose?s comments received fierce backlash from the public and city   officials alike after being circulated on social media on   Friday.   prevention advocates frequently decry the    that most sexual assaults are committed by strangers   and that such cases are more severe than assaults committed by   acquaintances. ? ?

All   complaints of rape and other types of sexual crimes are taken   seriously whether they are committed by domestic partners   acquaintances or strangers?

Detroit Lions safety Glover Quin is in the fourth year of his     $23. 5 million contract. But by living on just 30% of   that salary and investing the other 70% Quin has managed to   double his money in just eight years. ? ?

Whereas so many professional athletes blow through their huge   contracts and quickly go broke Quin has set himself up nicely   for the future.

For the first three years of his career Quin lived on $6 000 a   month and he invested the rest of his salary in     publicly traded companies.

When he signed his contract with Detroit in 2013 he did not go   out and spend wildly; he did not even buy a new car (he continues   to drive his 2009 Yukon Denali). Instead he diversified his   portfolio and began taking more investment risks. ? ?: ? ?   Quin insisted to  that he was a football player first but the time and   research he puts into his investments certainly sound like a     job.

Even in an NBA era with a rising salary cap and higher   salaries all around bad contracts can still exist. ? ?   Over two months into the season Chandler Parson?s contract with   the Memphis Grizzlies looks worryingly like it could be a bad   one. ? ?   Over the offseason the Grizzlies gave Parson a max. contract   worth $94 million over four years luring him from the Dallas   Mavericks and early suitors like the Portland Trailblazers. ? ?   Nearly all max deals carry a risk but Parsons?? deal was   especially risky. Parsons has undergone two knee surgeries a   ?hybrid microfracture? surgery in 2015 which kept him out of   multiple games in the   season and one to address a torn   meniscus in 2016. In his two seasons with the Mavericks he never   topped 66 games. ? ?   His tenure with the Grizzlies is not off to a good start. Parsons   has played just 12 games of a possible 38 and is yet to play in     . In 18 minutes per game he?s averaging five points   and two rebounds while shooting 33% from the field and 18% from     range.

390,64932,Kevin Love had some simple advice for the Cavs? newest sharpshooter on how to play with LeBron James,Business Insider,Scott Davis,1/7/2017,2017,1,,?  ? ?   The Cleveland Cavaliers are  with the Atlanta Hawks for   sharpshooter Kyle Korver. ? ?   As the Hawks begin what looks like the early stages of a   rebuilding project the Cavaliers come out as winners of the   trade acquiring one of the best   shooters in the NBA. ? ?   Korver?s addition would make the Cavaliers  ?   a team already   stocked with shooters and capable scorers  ?   even tougher to   defend. ? ?   And there?s reason to be optimistic that Korver would be even   better with the Cavs. Korver a career 43%   shooter   who?s led the NBA over the last decade in made threes has never   played with a passer like LeBron James. As defenses inevitably   gear up to stop James or any of the Cavs? other scorers Korver   should be basking in open    opportunities. ? ?   On Friday Kevin Love told reporters what his advice would be for   Korver summarizing how easy his job should be once he lands in   Cleveland: ? ? ? ? ?t?t?tKevin Love??s advice to Kyle Korver on playing with LeBron: ?When you catch the ball shoot it. ??t?t? ?   No need to overthink it. ? ?   That shouldn?t be too hard for Korver. This season James has   been passing better than ever averaging 8. 5 assists per game     of an assist shy of his career high. James has even   taken it upon himself to become the best playmaker possible by      when they shoot it. If Korver likes to catch the ball up high and   shoot it with the laces for example James would learn that and   deliver the ball to him that way at least according to James. ? ?   The Cavs are fifth in the NBA in offensive rating this season   scoring 110 points per 100 possessions. They?re also second in   the made threes per game canning 13 per contest. With Korver   both numbers should rise and he should enjoy a bounty of open   looks from beyond the arc. ?

395,64939,In a revealing interview with Henry Blodget Ray Dalio offers a radical solution to the threat of ?fake news? and details life inside Bridgewater,Business Insider,Henry Blodget,1/8/2017,2017,1,,?    ? ?    ? ? Ray Dalio is the founder of Bridgewater the world??s largest   hedge fund. A week ago his team reached out to me to   propose an interview. Mr. Dalio they said wanted to discuss the   problem of ?fake news? and ?distorted news? which he believes is   exemplified  about his company (and which he wrote   about in a  this week). We agreed on some ground   rules: We had control over what we published but Dalio wanted to   be sure we shared his views with our readers not our view of his   views. Thus I suggested a Q&A. ? ? I spoke with Dalio by phone for nearly two and a half hours.   To me the conversation was itself a case study of the   Bridgewater discussion style which includes lively debate and   open disagreement. ? ? Dalio has kept a low profile for most of his career at the   helm of Bridgewater which he founded in the kitchen of his   apartment in Queens 40 years ago. He explained that until   recently he wanted to be ?radically transparent within   Bridgewater and radically opaque to those outside it but as   the media are now trying to pry open Bridgewater? he wants to   clarify what??s going on. He also believes that the systems and   culture he has developed at Bridgewater once fully understood   would be useful well beyond the firm.   ? ? Highlights of the interview include: ? ? The transcript below is edited for length and clarity. ? ?Henry Blodget: Ray you recently said the Wall   Street Journal intentionally distorted the truth about   Bridgewater. What do you think the Wall Street Journal   intentionally distorted? ? ?Ray Dalio: I think they wanted to create a   picture of a weird oppressive place in which weird things are   going on rather than a place in which there?s a lot of hard work   and high standards and an unusual culture that works very   effectively. The media has the power to create an entrenched   perception of reality that?s incorrect. Many times people will be   quiet about that. I wanted to clarify what Bridgewater is like. ? ?Blodget: I want to be sure I understand the   distortions you??re referring to.  You   yourself have described this culture as ?kooky? and ?unusual.?   You have described it as the intellectual and office equivalent   of Navy SEALs  ?   where lots of people can??t handle it and drop out   and only a small tough team of already scrutinized and screened   people can handle it and those who can handle it think it??s   amazing. ? ?  ? ?Dalio: You?re painting something that is in the   right direction but an exaggeration. Twenty percent of our people   in the first year don?t like our culture and leave. Another 10%   don?t work out. So in the first two years 30% of the population   goes and then 70% stays. From that point forward we have hardly   any loss. Let me explain what our culture is based on. I think   the greatest tragedy of mankind is that people have ideas and   opinions in their heads but don?t have a process for properly   examining these ideas to find out what?s true. That creates a   world of distortions. That?s relevant to what we do and I think   it?s relevant to all decision making. So when I say I believe in   radical truth and radical transparency all I mean is we take   things that ordinarily people would hide and we put them on the   table particularly mistakes problems and weaknesses. We put   those on the table and we look at them together. We don?t hide   them. That?s what I mean by radical truth. I mean accepting   reality. So Bridgewater?s culture is not anywhere near as extreme   as you?re describing. ? ?Blodget: You?ve talked about how all meetings at   Bridgewater are recorded . You?ve been frustrated that this is often   portrayed as oppressive controlling Big Brother behavior. Can you   give us some examples of people who have been helped and improved   by the culture? People who as you have said would not want to   work anywhere else? ? ?Dalio: I can read you an   I got yesterday   from one our employees. I get them all the time. Do you want me   to read that? ? ?Blodget: You bet. ? ?  ? ?Dalio: ?Ray I wanted to thank you personally so   much for your generous support. I??m always so touched that you   continue to think of me and so many other people at this time of   year. I??m always at a loss of what to give back to you as you??ve   given so much. I want you to know how much Bridgewater your   principles and our way of being have meant to me and have helped   me especially through this past year. I??ve had one of the   toughest years of my life personally and I can??t tell you how   grateful I am to have the instilling and learning of values from   this company as well as amazing people who have been there to   help and to support me. Everyone will have tough times. I know   that and your principles have helped to guide and helped me make   sense of things. I know I can handle anything that life throws at   me and I??m a stronger person for having worked here for so many   years. I can??t tell you how grateful I am for that. The   principles that I rehearsed in my head often over the past year:   Have trust in truth and you have nothing to fear from truth as   well as everyone gets what they deserve out of life. I know it   was the combination of the principles I have lived with now and   are just part of me that have truly rounded things out for me   through the rough waters. I truly mean what I say and have said   to my parents often over the past six months. Thank God for   Bridgewater and you Ray. While I??m sure you do not realize the   extent of my gratitude to you please know that I??m eternally   grateful for you all of your teachings and for this amazing   company that I have been honored to be part of in the past 12   years and I hope will be my home for the rest of my career. I   will also do everything I can to make it and keep it great. I   love you Ray. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas.? ? ?   I get a lot of those. ? ?Blodget: That?s a great letter. And I can say   as a leader of a company it?s wonderful to get notes like that. ? ?Dalio: We are successful because we have those   kinds of relationships with each other that go way beyond the   job. I have a saying that the whole purpose of what we do is   meaningful work and meaningful relationships and they support   each other. That??s why I was frustrated by the Wall Street   Journal??s characterization of Bridgewater and the process they   used. I described these things to them and said I was happy to   have them speak to people like [the employee who wrote the   letter] and see our employee satisfaction surveys. But there was   no hearing it right? Instead they characterized our     process as something weird like ?turning Ray??s   brain into a computer.? [Editor??s note: These words were   those of a Bridgewater employee quoted in the WSJ article not   the characterization made by the reporter.] They also made   it seem like everyone??s crying in the bathroom all the time. I??m   sure somebody has cried in the bathroom. But it??s not like people   run around all day crying in bathrooms. I mean listen to [the   employee. ]. You can watch so many other people here who hug each   other and you know what Henry are in love with each other in a   sense and in love with the mission and that??s very powerful. ? ?Blodget: Let me read you some of the facts the   Wall Street Journal reported that I think are creating the   impression of ?weirdness?  ?   the impression that you see as   distorted. Now if we were sitting together on a set Ray I   would smile and wink at you before I read these things because a   lot of them do sound pretty wacky. First the Wall Street Journal   says Bridgewater is developing a systematic management software   system that is sometimes called ?The Book of the Future? ?The   One Thing? or ?Principles OS or just PriOS.? This system is   described as   directions for how staff should spend   their days and make decisions. Bridgewater employees rate each   other all the time on various attributes using apps. Bridgewater   employees each have a ?baseball card? that includes their ratings   on different criteria and anyone can access these cards. Every   employee takes written tests that measure various attributes and   every employee gets ranked in a ?stratum.? You according the   Wall Street Journal are in the highest stratum. You are also   considered based on all of these tests the most believable and   open employee at the company.  and Bridgewater is now   developing apps that direct employees to the appropriate section   of these Principles that will have the answer to their questions.   In the amazing employee letter you just read the employee   referred to your ?teachings? and the writer said ?I love you   Ray.? Now you have to admit all this sounds a little wacky   right Ray? I mean can you see where people from the outside   would look in and say ?Huh. That is kind of strange and out   there?? ? ?  ? ?Dalio: Okay.  Well first of all I??d like   to be clear that a number of people find me intolerable and they   don??t hesitate to say so  ?   which they and I cherish. We wouldn??t   be successful if we didn??t have independent thinkers who can   argue and then resolve their arguments. And yes I can see that   our culture appears odd. Yes we collect a lot of information.   Yes there are personality tests there??s performance reviews.   There are opinions. There??s a lot of information that is gathered   about people that they participate in. Then we go beyond that. We   collectively say okay how do we know who is good at what based   on objectively information. ?Stratum? for example is a measure   of how well you can view yourself and your ideas objectively. In   other words we as group say ?Okay now we??re looking at the   data on people the way we would look at the data on anything   else.? And ?Okay given all of those different perspectives how   should we make decisions?? ? ?Blodget: Are there things outside of trying to   get to the truth about a particular investment or trade that   you?re devoting this process to at Bridgewater? ? ?Dalio: Everything. ? ?Blodget: Is there always a majority after the   discussion? Is it just a simple vote? ? ?Dalio: No. We have a process of what we call   ?believability weighting? votes. I won??t go through it at length   but each person assesses each other person??s credibility on   different dimensions because people are strong and weak in   different things. Some people have subject matter expertise in   one thing. Some people tend to be creative but not reliable and   others are reliable but not creative. Everybody has different   dimensions. What we try to do is to keep that in mind and we??re   very clear about it. It??s very upfront. It??s very data based as   to why people have different strengths and weaknesses and what   their rankings are. It??s like a democracy of determining what   people??s believability is in different dimensions. And then when   we take a vote you get two numbers. You get the average number   equal weighted and you get   votes. So you   look at those two and usually they??re in alignment. If they??re   not in alignment we do another round of discussion and voting   and then we go with   vote generally   speaking. It??s a little bit more complicated to explain how   exactly it works. ? ?Blodget: It must be really complicated because   that?s pretty complicated. ? ?  ? ?Dalio: Here?s what I?m saying. Here?s the   overarching issue. We have an idea meritocracy and it has just   worked unbelievably well. It is a real idea meritocracy in which   there?s this radical truth and radical transparency and it?s not   understood. When you?re faced with a choice you have one of   three choices that you can have. You can have those with power   decide. You can have one man one vote. Or you can have      . I?m scared of one man   one vote because it suggests that everybody has an equal ability   at making decisions and I think that?s dangerous. I?m also   scared of people with power making the decision. How do you know   that that?s meritocratic? How do you   that? I would   like it to be that everybody knows that person?s knowledge on the   subject and we can draw upon those differences and actually have   the more knowledgeable people have more weight in the decision   making. That?s my motivation. That?s my dilemma and that?s what   I work to solve. It?s not perfect. I?m not saying it?s perfect.   But now you understand my thinking. That?s where it?s coming   from. ? ?Blodget: Do you ever have situations where you   go through all that and the vote comes out 51%   49% or   something awfully close? ? ?Dalio: Yes. It constitutes a small percentage of   the outcomes but it happens. Then what we do is we try to get   past it by discussing it and voting again. And then if we?re   still stuck with it we?ll just go with it. I really believe in   people here. That process is what keeps the independent thinkers   here. I must operate by that system. I think the President of the   United States must operate by rules. I think our judicial system   must operate by the rules. You have to operate by the rules of   the system and if you don?t if you pull rank then you lose all   your credibility. I have never overruled a decision. ? ?Blodget: So to be clear what frustrates you   about the Wall Street Journal article is mainly that they don?t   see Bridgewater?s culture the way you see it? ? ?  ? ?Dalio: What I?m saying about the Wall Street   Journal is I don?t think they were trying to find out what?s   true. Some people seek to understand and some people seek to   portray what they want to portray. I don?t know whether you?re   trying to understand or whether you have a picture that you want   to portray. I came into this discussion with the general   assumption that you were trying to do was to understand. ? ?Blodget: That?s what I?m trying to do. So let me   stipulate for the record: Bridgewater?s system obviously works   for Bridgewater  ?   and wow does it work for Bridgewater. You have   1 500 folks who can presumably work anywhere and 95% of them say   this system is helping them develop and they like it. ? ?Dalio: I?m saying something more. I?m saying our   system would work for most of the world. ? ?Blodget: That?s another question I?m going to   ask you. But first I just want to have us agree that it is true   to say that some people hear the facts and the reality of   Bridgewater and regard it as using your words kooky unusual   and great  ?     ? ?Dalio: I may have used the word ?kooky.? I will   retract the word ?kooky.? What I meant by that is unusual. It??s   unusual and it has produced unusually successful results  ?     including people not wanting to work anywhere else because they   love that we have an idea meritocracy. ? ?Blodget: My question is Ray isn??t the rich   media ecosystem we have in which so many different ideas and   opinions and views about reality are shared  ?   Isn??t that the   ?idea meritocracy? you??re trying to build at Bridgewater? And   isn??t that fundamentally a good thing? ? ?Dalio: Let me reply to your question with a   question. Do you really believe that most of the media is trying   to find out what is true or do you believe that they are   primarily trying to find facts to support their existing views? ? ?Blodget: I believe the some journalists and   media organizations are trying to find the truth. I also believe   that each journalist and media organization brings a particular   perspective to their work just as each Bridgewater employee   brings his or her own ideas and beliefs. But I believe the media   ecosystem as a whole  ?   with all of the diverse outlets and   perspectives  ?   combined with this amazing thing called the   internet in which anybody can publish their own view  ?   is a great   tool for helping us get to the truth overall. ? ?Dalio: Wow. We have a different perspective. And   now I?m fearful about having this interview with you. Your tone   suggests you?re you?re coming with a preconception. You?re not   trying to pull out and put down on paper my perspective. You?re     me in a particular way that seems like what you   want to do is characterize rather than seeking to understand and   convey. ? ?  ? ?Blodget: I actually respectfully in the spirit   of  ?   what do you call it at Bridgewater? ?Thoughtful   disagreement??  ?   disagree. ? ?Dalio: Well I hope so because I think if you   look at the statistics and you deal with fake media  ?   and fake   media and distorted media is a continuum  ?   the vast majority of   the population says ?I don??t know what to believe.? There are no   checks and balances in quality control. I treasure the fact   there??s media freedom but with that goes responsibility. I think   that there should be a   organization and that they   should start to think about standards. Because I think a lot of   people say ?I don??t know how to read what is true versus   somebody else??s interpretation.? ? ?Blodget: If you think the current media system   is broken what is the perfect system? ? ?Dalio: I don?t think there is such a thing as   the perfect system. I do think people need to recognize that a   lot of journalists want to write a story a certain way because   the story will be better or the portrayal will be better or at   least recognize that whenever you?re looking at something you?re   seeing it through somebody?s eyes who may actually not be the   person who is the most insightful. Like the saying goes don?t   believe everything you read. Second the motivations are not as   pure or the fact checking as not as pure as some people might   believe. I think that that?s a threat because people don?t know   what?s true. You have to put yourself in my shoes as a person who   believes in radical truth and in being radically transparent not   in seeing things through somebody else?s eyes. With the media we   don?t know what?s true and we don?t have radical transparency   because we?re seeing everything through somebody else?s eyes.   There?s no other industry that has as much power and as much   freedom and as little quality control. I can?t imagine how anyone   could not think that?s a problem. ? ?Blodget: Isn??t the check and balance in media   the existence of a free media? In which other outlets can say   ?Hey that thing that they wrote was complete crap. Here??s the   truth?? ? ?Dalio: Quote me on this. That sounds like   saying ?Isn??t the checks and balances on the financial system a   free financial system?? No I don??t think individual media   outlets will regulate. There are such things as     organizations that will look at the members of the industry and   their behavior and establish standards of behavior. ? ?Blodget: So this would be a     organization? Or a government regulator? And what would the   regulator do exactly? For example we just had a controversial   contentious election. Different media outlets had very different   views and portrayals of it. What would the regulator do in this   situation? ? ?  ? ?Dalio: First of all the question is does the   industry have a problem or not? Consumers believe there is a   problem and it?s a pervasive problem and it?s probably coming to   a head. We don?t know what truth is anymore. You or other media   people can say there?s no problem but you?re losing your   credibility. There?s distortion and it?s hurting our society.   And as a result of that there will be forces that one way or   another are going to naturally bring that into equilibrium.   Pendulums swing from one extreme to another extreme. As a result   I would think that a   organization would be   probably the best path. I wouldn?t want a government regulator   because it would threaten what I treasure as the free media. Who   would decide on what?s quality? I think that good media people   could do what other   organizations do  ?   say okay   we?re going to have standards. The American Motion Picture   Association represented the industry in creating rating for   movies. I think the industry can probably   without   regulation but I don?t believe an individual outlet can regulate   itself. ? ?Blodget: I would suggest that the media spends a   lot of time effectively regulating itself because media   organizations criticize other media organizations constantly and   talk about how everybody else is getting it wrong. ? ?Dalio: No I?m not talking about that. ? ?Blodget: But  ?     ? ?Dalio: I?m not talking about that. You want to   understand me right? ? ?Blodget: Absolutely. ? ?Dalio: I think the media argues all the time   with itself. That??s not what I??m talking about. I??m talking about   something in which there??s a standard of behaving. There??s no   regulatory body. There??s no judge. There??s no means of assessing   whether the truth was handled in a quality way. We??re stuck with   ?The Wall Street Journal said this.? ?I said this.? How do we   know what??s true? We??re just left with two people screaming at   each other. ? ?Blodget: My perspective is there is a     system in which everyone can share their view   which is exactly what we?re doing right now. ? ?Dalio: I thought this was an interview in which   you wanted to convey what I think. Is it an interview in which   you want to convey what I think? Or is it an interview in which   you want to convey what you think? ? ?Blodget: It?s an interview that I see as part of   an overall process to understand more deeply a very interesting   situation at Bridgewater and also something that you?ve   identified as a major issue in society which is distrust in the   news media and distortion. ? ?Dalio: Okay so let me then be clearer in terms   of your last question. Now what you?ve asked I think is the   question of is it a   system? The answer is I   don?t believe it?s an effective   system because I   think it is in the nature of individuals and individual entities   not to  . ? ?  ? ?Blodget: Is what we have done today is this   what happens at Bridgewater when you are trying to get to the   truth when people have different perspectives on things and they   challenge each other and ask questions of each other? Is this the   process? ? ?Dalio: It??s partially the process. The way it   works is that it would be a group of people who are having this   conversation. I thought that this was mostly an interview to get   out my perspective but in any case let??s suppose that we have   two different perspectives and instead of this being an interview   that this is a disagreement. Then what we would do is have a   voting process. Then you would be asked to judge whether the   parties were   as well as assertive. In other words   what??s expected of everybody is that they??re trying to find out   what??s true. It??s even more valuable and more admired to change   your opinion than to be right. But anyway at the end of it   there needs to be a resolution of a disagreement. That resolution   happens in a voting way. In order to get past disagreements you   just can??t have one person with power decide. In other words so   just because I??m a boss it would be terrible if I then said   ?Okay we??re gonna go do this.? That??s why after that thoughtful   disagreement there has to be a process of an idea meritocracy.   That means okay now you have to vote not that the decision   resides with power. And then you vote and move beyond it. ? ?Blodget: Let?s say that we have a group of   journalists who are interested in the truth. Let?s say that they   try to write the truth in a fair way and our President Elect   Donald Trump doesn?t like it or believe it. Have they done their   job? ? ?Dalio: Henry I think the basic problem is that   everybody thinks they know what the truth is and sometimes   they?re even distorting the truth to make their arguments. I?m   sure Donald Trump will think that he has the truth and some   journalist is arguing that he has truth and somebody else is   arguing that they have the truth. And in fact it?s even worse   than that because they?re so hell bent on their arguments that   they will distort the truth consciously. They?ll manipulate the   facts to support their arguments because they?re so hung up in   the fight. That?s where the problem is so we argue all the time.   We don?t have ways of resolving the arguments in idea   meritocratic way. ? ?Blodget: Given that we?re having a philosophical   discussion about the media one of the problems the media   struggles with is that we have to work within the attention spans   and schedules of the people who are consuming media. And although   I could talk about these topics all day I think most people will   have only a few minutes that they can devote to figuring out   which portrayal of Bridgewater?s culture is true. ? ?Dalio: Totally. We suffer from the same problem.   Therefore I empathize. And that is what actually produced the   tools we are developing at Bridgewater  ?   the technologies that   people can get at particular points so that the technology can   help them sort through decisions. I?m trying to find a way so   that anybody in the process can literally push a button and   get an answer or see the relevant part of a tape. Forget about   what the technology is. Just understand the motivation behind it.   If you have the power to see things through somebody else?s eyes   it?s like going from black and white to color or two dimensions   to three dimensions. It?s shocking and we have systems that do   that. This is what?s cool and that?s what I?m talking about. ?

397,73206,Obama: Reaching Out to Adversaries Alienating Allies,Atlantic,Uri Friedman,12/31/2016,2016,12,,As a presidential candidate Barack Obama promised to embrace America?s allies and extend a hand to its adversaries. As president he has made remarkable progress in engaging longtime foes restoring relations with Cuba and negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran. But the same can?t be said for all the country?s traditional friends. Obama certainly strengthened alliances with Western European nations turned off by George W. Bush and worked closely with other countries to fight ISIS and reduce climate change. But on his watch ties have frayed with several countries previously considered U. S. partners including Egypt Israel the Philippines Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The bitter    this week between U. S. and Israeli leaders on Israel?s settlement policy is just one illustration of this trend. These ties have frayed in part because of events outside Obama?s control such as the Egyptian Revolution and in the case of the Saudis the American   revolution. They?ve frayed because of the emergence in many of these countries of leaders who are personally and ideologically at odds with Obama. But they?ve also frayed because of the unique way in which the Obama administration has treated adversaries and allies. The prevailing logic within the administration appears to go something like this: Adversarial governments don?t want what the U. S. government wants so constructive relationships with them must initially be based on opportunities for dialogue. Eventually sustained engagement may help produce or identify areas of convergent interest. John Kerry?s Speech on the   Issue ?In light of the Cultural Revolution?s horrors Nixon?s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable ?  and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies? Obama declared in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. ?[W]e must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement pressure and incentives. ? Such logic helps explain why Obama has said in reference to the Iran nuclear agreement that ?you don?t make deals like this with your friends? and why during a visit to Havana he emphasized the importance of diplomacy despite his many differences with the Cuban government. By contrast Obama seems to believe that the United States and its allies should ?  in an ideal world at least ?  share interests and values. When an ally acts in ways he disapproves of Obama has been more willing than his recent predecessors to publicly criticize or marginalize it. Often this takes the form of Obama suggesting that while the ally ultimately wants what the U. S. wants it is going about things the wrong way. Hence Obama?s claim that he and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte share a desire to crack down on drug trafficking but that Duterte isn?t doing it ?the right way? or his assertion that steadfast U. S. support for Saudi Arabia against Iran isn?t good for the Saudis even though they think it is or his advice as a ?friend and partner of Turkey?s?  that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan avoid an   ?overreaction? after a failed coup attempt. Nowhere has this tendency been more evident than in Obama?s relations with Israel and specifically his longstanding disagreements with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the nuclear deal with Iran and the construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Here for instance is how Obama defended the Iran accord last year: I do not doubt [Netanyahu?s] sincerity. But I believe he is wrong. I believe the facts support this deal. I believe they are in America?s interest and Israel?s interest. And as president of the United States it would be an abrogation of my constitutional duty to act against my best judgment simply because it causes temporary friction with a dear friend and ally. I do not believe that would be the right thing to do for the United States. I do not believe it would be the right thing to do for Israel. U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed a similar sentiment this week in a speech on the   conflict. ?Friends need to tell each other the hard truths? Kerry argued and the hard truth in this case was that Israeli settlements are endangering a   peace deal with the Palestinians. That?s why the United States had declined to veto a recent UN resolution condemning Israel?s settlement activities Kerry explained: This friend the United States of America that has done more to support Israel than any other country this friend that has blocked countless efforts to delegitimize Israel cannot be true to our own values ?  or even the stated democratic values of Israel ?  and we cannot properly defend and protect Israel if we allow a viable   solution to be destroyed before our own eyes. And that?s the bottom line: The vote in the United Nations was about preserving the   solution. That?s what we were standing up for: Israel?s future as a Jewish and democratic state living side by side in peace and security with its neighbors. That?s what we are trying to preserve for our sake and for theirs. In fact this administration has been Israel?s greatest friend and supporter with an absolutely unwavering commitment to advancing Israel?s security and protecting its legitimacy. These critiques of allies? policies may well be justified but often they haven?t produced the changes that Obama has sought. The leaders of many of these countries have expressed resentment about the American president telling them what?s in their own best interests. Israel?s settlement construction and the Philippines? brutal drug war continue apace Turkey?s president is as authoritarian as ever Saudi Arabia remains rigidly opposed to Iran. One possible explanation for this lack of progress is that when it comes to inevitable disagreements with allies Obama has occupied a middle ground between the relatively gentle public prodding of his recent predecessors and the unpredictable iconoclasm of Donald Trump. Trump like Obama has at times been quite critical of traditional U. S. allies. But unlike Obama Trump doesn?t seem to be especially concerned about allies sharing U. S. values or to expect allies to broadly share U. S. interests he wants to partner with Vladimir Putin even though he doesn?t ?happen to like [the Russian political] system? and he routinely accuses U. S. allies of exploiting America?s generosity in pursuit of their own selfish goals. And unlike Obama Trump has suggested that he might seriously consider alternatives to these alliance arrangements should his criticisms not be addressed ?  that the United States could say withdraw its security commitments to Japan or NATO countries if they don?t invest more in their own defense. These positions have introduced destabilizing uncertainty into America?s intricate alliance system. But they also played a role in Japan?s prime minister hopping on the first plane to Trump Tower and NATO?s European members ramping up military spending shortly after Trump?s election. Obama on the other hand typically pairs his criticism of allies with a restatement of his strong commitment to the alliance. This is the complicated legacy the president leaves behind. He has succeeded in forging deals with hostile nations after decades of estrangement and emphasized the importance of collaborating with allies to address international challenges while nevertheless leaving a number of allies feeling estranged. It?s premature to assess Obama?s tenure the bets he?s placed will take years to pay off. But he leaves office amid signs however faint that Trump could be more effective at changing the behavior of some American allies than Obama who often valued those alliances too much to jeopardize them.

399,73208,The New Reality TV,Atlantic,Megan Garber,12/31/2016,2016,12,,?Reality seems tired. It seems derivative? a former network executive told Vulture in 2015. ?There hasn?t been a really loud innovative reality show in a while. ? The executive was correct unless you consider television?s fictions ?  which in 2016 became more realistic than ever. Atlanta on FX directly tackled one of the formerly taboo issues in television: money. Speechless on ABC found humor and heart in the details of living ?  and having a family member who is living ?  with cerebral palsy. This Is Us on NBC portrayed its central family with sentimentalism but also with a   look examination of the tensions that can bedevil even the closest of families. Insecure on HBO portrayed the ins and outs of friendship and romance in a way that was designed to hit the show?s creator Issa Rae has put it ?a regular person nerve. ? Television has long had a fraught relationship with the ?regular? person. Many of its shows from Leave It to Beaver on down have relied on the power of aspiration ?  the ideal family the ideal group of friends impossibly beautiful people inhabiting impossibly beautiful places ?  to amplify the appeal of the ?normal? worlds they?ve served up to their viewers. Dallas with its showy wealth and early McMansions doubled as an advertisement for all that might be obtained by way of the   of the American ?80s. Friends the next decade may have paid lip service to everyday concerns like rent costs and health insurance it was set however in an apartment that no one with real money troubles could have ever afforded. Those shows and their many many counterparts claimed to embrace averageness they also however scene after scene treated averageness as something to be overcome. Many of the new shows of 2016 though took that approach ?  the everyday gilded with the shiny stuff of fantasy ?  and stripped it of its varnish. The concerns that were so often in the past relegated to the plot lines of individual episodes (a   here an illness there) were put   as series overtly emphasized what used to be matters of taboo: money infidelity weight special needs. In a year in which so many things beyond politics themselves were political many TV shows continued a trend that had been brewing with the rise of social media and Peak TV. Perhaps realizing television?s power to change the way people see the world show creators rejected easy aspiration and blithe escapism ?  they instead got insistently and compellingly real. And so: HBO?s Divorce attempted to portray the ending of a marriage with unvarnished ?  and often unbearable ?  honesty. ABC?s American Housewife forthrightly (if clunkily) made its main character?s weight a central fact of its show. Amazon?s Fleabag was in many ways a tonal   to the streaming service?s 2015 show Catastrophe ?  which offered an unflinching look at both friendship and more significantly grief. Netflix?s The Crown was an only lightly fictionalized representation of the early days of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. FX?s American Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson recreated with for the most part remarkable fealty the ?trial of the century. ? 2016 was also a year that found   documentaries continuing their cultural ascendence. In the footsteps of 2015?s Making a Murderer and The Jinx there was Amanda Knox on Netflix and The Witness and Team Foxcatcher and ESPN?s magisterial 30 for 30 documentary O. J.: Made in America. There was Ava DuVernay?s 13th. There was Weiner which after its run in theaters aired on Showtime. This all came at a moment that found American culture at large celebrating ?  reveling in ?  the real. The world of Facebook updates and ?It Happened to Me?  essays and #confessyourunpopularopinion is also a world that when asked how it?s doing might give a more honest answer than the traditional ?Fine and you?? The age of social media allowing people such unprecedented access to the details of each others? lives also encourages them to shed the polite niceties that can so often can double as light lies. Why bother with ?I?m fine? when a status update knows otherwise? The Golden Age of the TV Bathroom And TV?s creators increasingly are reflecting that impulse in their output rejecting the old   juggernauts that sold fantasy in the guise of normalcy. Instead TV is offering more and more shows like Atlanta which depicts the lives of its characters ?  and in particular the crushing weight that comes from never having enough money ?  with unvarnished honesty. Or like Fleabag which strategically blurs the line between empathy and awkwardness. Or like Designated Survivor which is premised on an extraordinary event ?  the destruction of Congress during the State of the Union ?  but which goes out of its way to emphasize the   consequences of that massive act of terror. Those shows are responding to ?how are you?? with the real answer ?  which is sometimes more uncomfortable than the bland alternative but which is often much more relatable. It?s an approach that isn?t of course a universal trend. One of the consequences of the age of Peak TV is that there will be many many types of shows on air at any point and many many genres to contain them. Shows like Atlanta and Insecure with their admirable   are airing at the same time as shows like Game of Thrones and MacGyver and Timeless and Stranger Things which take the fictional affordances of TV ?  dragons! time travel! communicative Christmas lights! ?  to many of their logical extremes. And many    series ?  like Son of Zorn which finds an   (and animated) action hero attempting to win back his ( )   and son and like The Good Place which is set in a Disneyesque heaven ?  are experimenting with whimsy that borders on magical realism. But even some of the most fantastical new shows of 2016 ?  Stranger Things Westworld The Get Down ?  are tinged with and in their way premised on reality. They are simply in their execution more intentional and more precise about what is real and what is   ?     not. And the other shows the more realistic ones are unapologetic about reflecting the world as it is rather than as it might be. This fall discussing some of the more experimental comedies that NBC and Fox put out The New York Times mentioned ?a new programming strategy for   prime time? ?  one responding to Peak TV by getting kookier and more experimental and in many ways more interesting. ?Broadcasters are not quite throwing in the ratings towel? Brooks Barnes noted but they are trying to worry less about an immediate mass audience and more about finding at the very least a group of core fans attracted to a strong comedic point of view ?  what Jennifer Salke NBC?s president of entertainment calls ?not a broad and soft       kind of show. ? One way to find that core of fans may be ?  in the manner of Bojack Horseman and Arrested Development and The Good Place ?  to surprise and delight them with televised whimsy. Another though may be simply to echo fans? real lives as they?re lived every day: to win people over not with fantasy but with relatability. It?s a powerful thing after all to see your self reflected back to you on a screen. TV?s creators are realizing that and ?  artistically and commercially ?  capitalizing on it. In 2016 reality as a genre may still have been derivative and as a consequence dull. Reality as an artistic approach however was more powerful and more popular than ever ?  and more realistic for that matter than ?reality? itself could ever hope to be.
400,73209,5 Numbers That Explain Education in 2016,Atlantic,Emily DeRuy,12/31/2016,2016,12,,As a writer I generally favor words over numbers. But sometimes a good number is worth a thousand words. Or something like that. In that spirit here are five numbers that help explain the state of education in 2016 (with a smattering of words thrown in for good measure). 83  This is the percentage of American   who graduated on time during the   school year (the most recent year for which there is data available). While 83 percent is a   overall graduation rate the rates for some groups of students such as blacks and Latinos are much lower. Although persistent gaps remain schools and nonprofits are finding creative ways to serve what is an increasingly diverse student body. 5  Five is the number of states that do not provide any funding for preschool. While expanding   education is increasingly seen by both Republicans and Democrats as a valuable investment Idaho Montana New Hampshire South Dakota and Wyoming have held out for a variety of reasons. How long these states remain outliers is unclear. There is more brain science than ever to suggest investments in the early years pay off. And there is an increasing amount of attention being paid to how preschool and quality childcare can help reduce the multimillion gap in the number of words babies from wealthy and poor families hear. Yet even when states and cities do invest in preschool programs it?s not always clear that they?re funding approaches that are the best for kids. 2. 8 million  Fewer students are being booted from class for misbehavior than in previous years. Yet 2. 8 million students still received    suspensions during the   school year the most recent year for which data is available. A disproportionate percentage of those students were children of color or children with disabilities which has prompted the Obama administration to frame school discipline as a   issue. Research suggests that students who are kicked out of school are much more likely to struggle as adults. Yet the administration?s support of concepts like restorative justice which keep kids in school has left some teachers feeling abandoned. 6  According to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools around 6 percent of students enrolled in U. S. public schools attend charter schools. That translates to not quite 3 million students nationally and a more than 60 percent increase since 2010. That number could rise even more dramatically in the coming years if the Trump administration succeeds in its mission of expanding school choice. Betsy DeVos who is set to become the next U. S. secretary of education has supported efforts to expand access to both charter schools and vouchers which let students use public money to pay for private school. While her   views have earned her praise from a number of Republicans teachers? unions have repeatedly alleged that charters harm traditional public schools. 30  Pinning down the exact number of   college students (or even whom that term covers) is difficult but the general consensus seems to be that at least 30 percent of today?s college students are the first in their families to pursue higher education. These students are less likely than their peers from families who have experience with college to graduate on time. So as more   students make their way to college schools are grappling with how to serve them whether that means developing mentor programs or even sending students text reminders about   deadlines. There?s still plenty of room for improvement both when it comes to expanding access to higher education and to helping students succeed once they reach campus.

402,73211,What Would Change Your Mind About President Trump?,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,12/30/2016,2016,12,,If recent measures of public opinion hold President Trump will enter office viewed unfavorably by 49 percent of Americans. 43 percent of Americans view him favorably. The deepest fears of his critics include the possibility of nuclear catastrophe. His most enthusiastic backers believe he?ll ?make America great again. ? Will either group prove able to judge the Trump Administration based on its performance in office rather than their prejudgments about the president?s fitness? To discipline my own thinking I?ve formulated markers that I will use to evaluate President Trump and the executive branch agencies that his appointees will soon lead. If Trump governs without my fears coming to pass his supporters can rightly cite this article as evidence that the president they championed wasn?t as bad as I imagined he might be. To discipline their thinking in turn I would ask those who support Trump to lay down markers of their own prior to his inauguration. When judged against a governing record rather than an opponent what must he do to keep earning their support? What broken promises civil liberties abrogations manners of corruption or other failures in office would cause them to withdraw support? My tentative markers are as follows: International Affairs If Trump manages to avoid a more dangerous nuclear landscape a trade war a great powers conflict ordering war crimes weakening NATO or otherwise blundering in foreign policy on the scale of the Iraq War he will exceed my expectations. If he even avoids doing marginal harm to American interests with undisciplined tweeting I will be shocked ?   ?  the responsible   course would be to give up Twitter on inauguration day in recognition of his inability to control himself on the medium (a common affliction but one a head of state can ill afford). Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  Corruption If Trump and his appointees avoid these transgressions they will exceed my expectations. Polarization and Balkanization When explaining my vote against Trump I wrote ?The most dangerous thing a leader can do in an ethnically diverse country is to stoke ethnic tensions to gain power. One needn?t invoke the Nazis to see that truth. Look to the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda Iraq or Syria. America isn?t on the verge of civil war but that?s in large part because while the exploitation of ethnic grievances has always been part of our politics our leaders have at least held themselves to a certain standard in their public statements. Trump kicked off his campaign by encouraging his followers to think of Mexican migrants as mostly rapists attacked an   judge of Hispanic ancestry repeatedly savaged Muslims inspired multiple hate crimes against minorities used his Twitter platform with an audience of millions to retweet and elevate   and inspired more energy and assertiveness from the white supremacist movement than I can ever recall. ? I fear Trump will continue to stoke ethnic tensions in ways calculated to shore up his support and that fringe white supremacists and   will continue to gain power during his tenure. If neither of these things happens he will exceed my expectations. Personal Misconduct My fears about Trump are many. And I would be grateful to hear from readers about other markers that I might lay down on matters of importance that I have so far missed. But as I noted on election night ?Hopefully Trump will surprise his detractors and behave better in the White House than he has in the 2016 campaign his business career and his personal life. For the sake of the nation and the world I hope he rises to the occasion and that he respects the civil liberties of every American regardless of their identity. In any project that benefits the nation while safeguarding civil rights and liberal norms I wish him success. ? For Trump supporters who believe that my fears are overblown but share my convictions about the importance of a president who respects the Bill of Rights eschews corruption and otherwise avoids actions that harm the nation and its people I would ask for emails sketching out behavior that would cause you to stop supporting Trump. My email is conor@theatlantic. com if there are any willing correspondents. Let?s flesh out what success or failure would mean before it?s time to judge it.

S. diplomats in retaliation for the sanctions levied against Moscow for alleged interference in the U. S. presidential election and condemned the move as an act of ?kitchen diplomacy. ? It?s not immediately clear if the sanctions will deter the Kremlin from future acts of interference or if they will even survive the incoming administration.   Donald Trump could reverse the sanctions once he enters office and said he believes the U. S. should ?move on. ? Trump has expressed skepticism over Russia?s involvement in the hack which as David Frum writes may stem from the delegitimizing effect it could have on his presidency. Monumental Acts: President Barack Obama exercised the executive powers afforded to him by the 1906 Antiquities Act to create the Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah. The move which placed the region under federal protection was lauded by environmentalists and Native leaders but infuriated Republican lawmakers who had their own plans for the area. It marks the 29th time Obama has invoked his power to protect public land and is one the incoming administration will likely be unable to undo. Highs and Lows: As the year comes to a close 2016 stands to go down as one of the strongest years for the U. S. economically since the   witnessing both a drop in unemployment as well as a rise in wages and consumer confidence.

To close out the series as the year changes over here are two readers who made big changes in the middle of their careers: I graduated from law school right after graduating college and working at several different jobs never finding that I was making a difference.

I quickly landed my dream job teaching middle school Language Arts and never looked back. This reader on the other hand decided law was for her and became an attorney after she?d spent 20 years in nursing: The leap was motivated by a desire to do ?more? than the acceptable female career choice I?d made in 1970. I thought I might be too old to make the change at almost 40 and then a wonderful friend asked ?How old will you be if you don?t do it??

404,73213,Does Anyone Know What to Make of Obama?s Sanctions?,Atlantic,David A. Graham,12/30/2016,2016,12,,What is a bewildered citizen to make of the sanctions that President Obama levied on Russian officials and the Russian government on Thursday? The confusion starts with the news coverage. The Associated Press for example blares that ?President Barack Obama has slapped harsh sanctions on the Russian intelligence services. ? Meanwhile the former head of the CIA?s Russia operations tells The New York Times ?I think these sanctions are pretty weak. It?s more perhaps symbolic. ? Some sloppy reports even suggested wrongly that Russian agents had interfered with vote counts or voting machines. Trying to follow partisan cues won?t help either as ?  in what is emerging as a hallmark of the Donald Trump era ?  the traditional alliances on foreign policy within and between the parties are scrambled and broken. Across party lines various voices seem unable to decide whether to blame Russia for hacking that intelligence officials say was intended to interfere with the 2016 election likely to aid Trump nor on how to react appropriately to that hacking. The   himself issued a nebulous statement Thursday afternoon which was evidently a response to Obama?s sanctions though he did not make any explicit connection. ?It?s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things? Trump said. ?Nevertheless in the interest of our country and its great people I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation. ? Like many Trump statements this one raises as many questions as it answers. If it?s time to move on why bother meeting? If it?s important why has he waited so long? Why has he been declining so many intelligence briefings? Given that Trump has been briefed on the hacks what might he hear that would induce him to change his mind? On Friday Trump tweeted more praise for Putin apparently lauding him for not immediately retaliating after the sanctions though his wording was unclear. Great move on delay (by V. Putin)   I always knew he was very smart! In any event it is an example of the   supporting a foreign autocrat over the U. S. government ?  an example of the reality that my colleague Uri Friedman identified last week in which there are effectively dueling American presidents. The reactions among Trump?s inner circle remain splintered too. Kellyanne Conway a senior adviser dismissed the sanctions as ?largely symbolic? and said that Russian intelligence did not keep assets in the United States a judgment that one   reporter openly mocked. (She at least may have the excuse of not being briefed unlike her boss.) On the other hand John Bolton whose name seems to have sunk somewhat in the sweepstakes for a Trump State Department appointment who was seen just a couple weeks ago complaining that the intelligence was so shaky that the attack could well have been a   operation now says that Obama should have done much more to ?make the Russians feel the pain. ? The Heritage Foundation the conservative institution that has largely appended itself to the Trump team produced a short video charging that Obama had invited the hacking by being too lenient with Russia: Vladimir Putin respects two things: strength and consistency In the last eight years President Obama has shown neither. pic. twitter.  ?It?s time to deal with Russia from a position of strength? the video concludes. Taking a similar position is Jack Kingston a former U. S. representative and current Trump adviser who tweeted ?Putin outplays Obama again. Obama embarrassing himself on the way out the door. ? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also portrayed Obama?s sanctions as too little and too late. ?Sanctions against the Russian intelligence services are a good initial step however late in coming? he said in a statement. ?As the next Congress reviews Russian actions against networks associated with the U. S. election we must also work to ensure that any attack against the United States is met with an overwhelming response. ? (McConnell has been attempting a difficult dance ?  with one hand pushing back on demands for a special committee to investigate the hack while using the other to insist that despite what Trump says the intelligence community is reliable.) Most Republican members of Congress seem to be in McConnell?s general vicinity and worried about the threat of foreign powers interfering with electoral processes. This creates a potential collision between them and the Trump administration early on despite the best efforts of people like McConnell to build unity. After all expressing concern over hacking and asking for an inquiry is diametrically opposed to Trump?s view that it probably wasn?t the Russians and even if it was it?s time to move on. Some conservatives have spent the last eight years complaining that Obama has been too accommodating of Russia. But the reactions from Heritage Bolton McConnell and others carry the implication that Trump will take a harder line. To call that expectation unsupported would be an understatement. The   spent the presidential campaign promising friendlier relations with Russia he suggested he would recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea he nominated a vocal critic of sanctions on the Kremlin as a secretary of state and so on. Then there?s Representative Trent Franks an Arizona Republican who argues that maybe Russia is responsible and maybe it?s not ?  but that if it is that?s not such a bad thing.  ?If Russia succeeded in giving the American people information that was accurate then they merely did what the media should have done? Franks said on MSNBC Thursday. (He is not the only person to make this case.) It doesn?t take an advanced degree to see the problems with this statement. One can defend the press?s decision to cover the hacked material and even celebrate the effects of the hacked material without inviting foreign powers to hack into the emails of political leaders (or those of the nation?s top diplomat as Trump did during the campaign). Obama is indeed tardy to the role of hawk in   relations. But on the left particularly the farther left there?s concern that he is  . Glenn Greenwald points out that there?s a long history of American intelligence misleading both the public and elected officials though Greenwald also believes the hacks should be fully investigated. The skepticism of intelligence sourcing is   though one question that looms over the debate is precisely what evidence would convince a doubter like Trump of Russian involvement short of video footage of Putin himself writing malware. There?s growing consensus that evidence points to Russian actors in the hacks although there is less public proof that they were intended to aid Trump. In any case there?s no good argument to make against asking for stronger evidence even if Trump?s allies keep trying to make one. Not every critique is quite so carefully thought out: For those who criticize WikiLeaks for not publishing RNC emails or more Putin docs: why don?t you just publish them yourselves? This rather seems to be begging the question if WikiLeaks did as alleged receive the DNC documents thanks to Russian state actors then it has a unique source. Any news organization able to get its hands on Putin docs or RNC emails would almost certainly publish them. (Please! Send them here!) The Nation which has in recent years tended to view any criticism of Russia ?  including of its expansionist impulses ?  as a resurgence of McCarthyism sees in this case yet another sign that there?s a new Cold War brewing. The dangers of nuclear war and the malign effects on political discourse within the United States are no less horrifying than they were 50 years ago. The specter of the U. S. expelling Russian officials as personae non grata on Thursday was straight out of the Cold War playbook of action and reaction even if some commentators seemed to be unaware of the old   ritual of allowing some suspected spies to stay in the country just so there was someone to throw out in a crisis. But the rejection of any criticism of Russia has serious shortcomings. Labeling critiques of Putin?s Russia as nothing more than McCarthyism will come as little consolation to Russian dissidents being crushed by Putin. And what if it?s proven that Russia did hack to interfere with the election? Should these fears paralyze the United States and prevent it from responding? Meanwhile an entirely different faction on the left is arguing that Trump is all but (or maybe simply is) a     Kremlin agent. The only person who seems to be enjoying all of this is Putin. If he did in fact direct the hacks in an attempt to help Trump then it?s a huge win: Trump pulled off the upset and now he gets a friendly leader in Washington. If he directed the hacks in order to create chaos among American policymakers then he gets that too. And even if Russia was totally uninvolved it benefits from all of these dynamics and will still have a friendly leader in the White House come January 20. The disorder in Washington has given Putin the opportunity to pose as the serene statesman regarding the scene with equanimity. Putin announced that he would not expel any American diplomats despite the public recommendation of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. (This seems possibly choreographed.) He even invited the children of American diplomats to a bash at the Kremlin. It?s a   troll. Not for some time has Putin had such an opportunity to gloat. He?s also just managed to strike a   deal in Syria at least as long as it holds. But Russia remains much diminished from its Cold War peak. Its economy is in shambles a state of affairs likely to persist even if Trump removes sanctions especially if the price of oil remains low. Jeet Heer is not the first to point out (despite what he seems to believe) that the latest   has a pedigree. Russia remains angry about U. S. moves to expand NATO into Eastern Europe in the years after the Soviet Union and for its support of   activists in Russia and other former Soviet republics which it regards as financing efforts to overthrow governments. But successive U. S. presidents have entered office seeking better relations with the Kremlin. In June of 2001 George W. Bush met with the   Russian president and infamously declared ?I looked the man in the eye. I found him very   and trustworthy ?  I was able to get a sense of his soul. ? But Bush came to infuriate Putin with American support of the ?color revolutions? in Eastern Europe in the   and at the very end of Bush?s term Putin spited him by seizing Georgian territories. Obama entered office promising better relations than his predecessor. He infamously dispatched   of State Hillary Clinton to present a ?reset? button to Lavrov. That effort came to naught too with Putin seizing Crimea intervening on behalf of Bashar   in Syria and allegedly overseeing hacks to interfere with the election. Trump now says he is the one to shepherd closer relations. One possible takeaway from this sequence is not that the United States and Russia are on the brink of a new Cold War but rather than the old one never really ended.
405,73214,Ten American Foreign Policy Luminaries Who Died in 2016,Atlantic,James M. Lindsay,12/30/2016,2016,12,,The end of the year is a time for taking stock counting successes and assessing failures. It is also a time for remembering those who are no longer with us. Here are ten Americans who died in 2016 who through their vision service intellect or courage helped shape U. S. foreign policy. They will be missed. Muhammad Ali (b. 1942) was an   boxing great and one of the most influential athletes of the twentieth century in good part because he risked his career for his beliefs. Born in Louisville Kentucky as Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. Ali won the Olympic   title in Rome in 1960. Less than four years later he won the world heavyweight title by beating a heavily favored Sonny Liston. The day after the fight Clay announced that he had become a member of the Nation of Islam. Within weeks he changed his name to Muhammad Ali though most journalists continued to call him Cassius Clay. In 1967 Ali?s request to be granted conscientious objector status was rejected. When he refused induction into the U. S. Army he was convicted of draft evasion and sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed his conviction which the Supreme Court overturned in 1971. While Ali never served prison time he was stripped of his heavyweight title during the prime of his career and barred from boxing for more than three years. After he returned to the ring he went on to win the world heavyweight title twice more. Parkinson?s disease eventually robbed Ali of his physical grace and oratorical skills. In 1996 the man once pilloried for converting to Islam and refusing to be drafted was enthusiastically cheered as he lit the flame at the opening of the centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta. Doris Bohrer (b. 1923) was a spy for the United States during World War II. Born Doris Sharrar in Basin Wyoming she grew up mostly in Silver Spring Maryland dreaming of being a pilot. In 1942 she joined the Office of Strategic Services the forerunner to the CIA. Like most women at the time she had limited career prospects. But she proved to be the exception. Originally hired as a typist she was chosen in 1943 to attend photo reconnaissance school. She was posted to Egypt and then to Italy?s Adriatic coast where she helped plan allied troop drops and scoured aerial photographs of German troop movements and manufacturing production. Bohrer who changed her name after marrying her husband and fellow CIA employee Charles A. Bohrer remained in the spy business after the war. Although she encountered significant sexism from her colleagues she rose through the ranks eventually retiring from the Agency in 1979 as deputy chief of counterintelligence. Little was known about Bohrer?s intelligence career until 2011 when a Washington Post reporter wrote about her and another female OSS veteran Elizabeth McIntosh. The two women gave a fascinating joint interview to NBC News in 2013. Larry Colburn (b. 1949) joined with two fellow soldiers to stop the 1968 My Lai Massacre. Colburn was an    member of a   U. S. Army helicopter crew assigned to monitor My Lai on the morning of March 16 1968 while Charlie Company swept through the hamlet. The pilot Chief Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr. landed the helicopter after realizing that a massacre was in progress. Lt. William Calley who would become the only U. S. Army officer convicted for the atrocities that killed some 500 South Vietnamese ignored Thompson?s demand that he stop the killings. So Thompson positioned his helicopter between the U. S. troops and surviving villagers. He then ordered Colburn to fire his   machine gun at anyone who threatened the villagers. Colburn replied ?You got it boss. Consider it done. ? Thompson Colburn and the helicopter?s crew chief Glenn Andreotta then flew survivors to safety and reported the massacre to their superior officers. Those commanders however covered up the killings. The world did not learn about My Lai until journalist Seymour Hirsch broke the story in November 1969. Thirty years after the massacre Andreotta Colburn and Thompson were awarded the Soldier?s Medal ?  the highest award given by the U. S. military for bravery not involving conflict with an enemy ?  for their heroism at My Lai. Andreotta received his medal posthumously he was killed in combat three weeks after My Lai. Tom Hayden (b. 1939) was a founder of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. Born in Royal Oak Michigan he attended the University of Michigan where he became editor of the student newspaper the Michigan Daily. For all his love of journalism Hayden?s passion was politics. He became involved in civil rights protests which led him and   other activists to form the SDS in Ann Arbor in 1960. After being arrested in 1961 while participating in the Freedom Rides he wrote a   manifesto that eventually was revised and released by the SDS as the Port Huron Statement which proclaimed itself to be an ?agenda for a generation. ? As U. S. involvement in Vietnam deepened Hayden became involved in the   movement. In 1968 he helped plan protests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The resulting clashes between protestors and police were later labeled ?a police riot? by a national commission. Hayden and others who planned the protests were arrested on charges of conspiracy and inciting to riot. The   Chicago Seven were acquitted of conspiracy but Hayden and four of his   were convicted on the    charge and sentenced to five years in prison. The verdict was overturned on appeal. Hayden may be best remembered for his   marriage to Jane Fonda. He wrote nearly   books the last of which Hell No: The Forgotten Power of the Vietnam Movement will be released next month. Donald Henderson (b. 1928) helped eradicate smallpox a disease that killed an estimated 300 million people in the twentieth century alone. Born in Lakewood Ohio and known as D. A. he graduated from nearby Oberlin College and earned his medical degree at the University of Rochester. In 1955 he joined the Epidemic Intelligence Service a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He helped pioneer a U. S. effort to eliminate smallpox in Africa. In 1966 he took charge of the World Health Organization?s global campaign. He wasn?t expected to succeed. The WHO effort was poorly funded and similar WHO campaigns to curb yellow fever and malaria had flopped. Henderson wasn?t a man to be stopped by scant financial or political support though. His team developed a vaccine that could survive in tropical climates along with new techniques and tactics for inoculating vulnerable populations. After a decade of work the effort succeeded. The last documented case of smallpox was recorded in Somalia in 1977. The eradication of smallpox generated calls for similar campaigns against other deadly infectious diseases. Henderson was skeptical however that such campaigns would work. He argued that the smallpox virus had several unique features that made it easier to defeat. So when he changed his mind in 2011 about the potential to eradicate polio it became big news. Alas while the campaign to eradicate polio has reduced the incidence of the dreaded disease it has yet to achieve its ultimate goal. Melvin Laird (b. 1922) was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives nine times and served as secretary of defense during Richard Nixon?s first term. Laird was born in Omaha Nebraska but was raised in his mother?s hometown of Marshfield Wisconsin. A graduate of Carleton College he joined the U. S. Navy in 1942. He was awarded a Purple Heart during his service on the destroyer USS Maddox in the Pacific theater of World War II. As Laird?s time in the Navy was winding down he turned to the family business ?  politics. His grandfather had been Wisconsin?s lieutenant governor and his father was a Wisconsin state senator. In 1946 his father died and he won the race to succeed him in the Wisconsin state senate. Six years later Laird was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives. He gained prominence in the   for criticizing Lyndon Johnson for failing to be more aggressive in fighting the Vietnam War. By the time he became secretary of defense in 1969 however he had concluded that the war could not be won on the battlefield. He championed the Nixon administration?s efforts to withdraw U. S. troops from South Vietnam and to empower the South Vietnamese army to protect the country a policy he named ?Vietnamization. ? His relations with the White House grew tense though when he opposed Nixon?s decision to hide the bombing of Cambodia from the American public. As he promised from the start Laird stepped down as secretary of defense at the end of Nixon?s first term. Under Laird?s leadership the Pentagon replaced the discredited draft deferment system which favored young men from upper   backgrounds with a lottery system. By the end of his time as secretary of defense Laird had paved the way for the transition to an   force. Sydney Schanberg (b. 1934) was a New York Times correspondent whose coverage of the Khmer Rouge insurgency in Cambodia won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting and inspired the classic film The Killing Fields. Schanberg was born and raised in Clinton Massachusetts. After graduating from Harvard University in 1955 he was drafted into the U. S. Army where he served as a reporter in Germany. Journalism would become his career. He joined the Times in 1959. A decade later he was made a foreign correspondent and dispatched to India to cover South and Southeast Asia. In 1972 while covering the rise of the Khmer Rouge he met Dith Pran a Cambodian journalist who eventually became his assistant and translator. Almost every journalist fled Phnom Penh when it fell to the Khmer Rouge in April 1975. Schanberg and Dith however ignored their editors? orders to join the exodus and instead remained behind to document the rule of the new regime led by Pol Pot. The decision almost proved fatal. Schanberg and Dith were captured and nearly executed by Khmer Rouge soldiers only Dith?s pleas saved their lives. Schanberg was subsequently able to flee Cambodia Dith as a Cambodian national wasn?t. While Schanberg was back stateside writing about what he had witnessed and helping Dith?s wife and four children resettle in San Francisco Dith was witnessing firsthand the horrors of Pol Pot?s rule. In     years the Khmer Rouge killed an estimated two million Cambodians. Vietnamese forces finally ousted Pol Pot from power in early 1979. Dith soon escaped and Schanberg persuaded the Times to hire him as a photographer. On January 20 1980 Schanberg?s unforgettable story ?The Death and Life of Dith Pran? ran in The New York Times Magazine. It was later published as a book. Thomas Schelling (b. 1921) was a Nobel   economist whose pioneering work on game theory provided new insights into nuclear strategy. Schelling was born in Oakland California earned his undergraduate degree at the University of California Berkeley and his doctorate in economics from Harvard University. He taught economics at Yale University from 1953 to 1958 before returning to Harvard where he would remain until 1990. In 1960 he published perhaps his most influential work The Strategy of Conflict. Based in part on work he had done during a fellowship at the RAND Corporation it applied insights from game theory to analyze international conflict and competition. It was this effort to promote ?understanding of conflict and cooperation through   analysis? that led to his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2005 a prize he shared with Robert Aumann. During the Kennedy administration Schelling headed a committee that recommended establishing a hotline between Soviet and U. S. leaders to prevent miscommunication during crises. Schelling had fans outside academia and government: his review of the novel Red Alert helped inspire director Stanley Kubrick to write Dr. Strangelove. Schelling served as a consultant on the film. In 1990 Schelling whose research interests had always been diverse joined the faculty of the University of Maryland?s Department of Economics and School of Public Policy where he worked on problems ranging from climate change to smoking. Thomas Sutherland (b. 1931) was a professor of agriculture who was held hostage for six years during the Lebanese civil war by Hezbollah. Sutherland was born and raised on a dairy farm in Falkirk Scotland. He received his bachelor?s degree from the University of Glasgow and then earned his Ph. D. from Iowa State University in 1958. He taught for more than two decades at Colorado State University and became an American citizen. In 1983 he went on leave to become dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Science at the American University of Beirut. Two years later he was kidnapped from his car. He spent much of his captivity with journalist Terry Anderson ironically a fellow Iowa State graduate and the only Western hostage to be held longer by Hezbollah. Sutherland was repeatedly abused physically and mentally by his captors especially during the first two years of his captivity. After protracted negotiations he was finally released in November 1991 along with another hostage the Anglican cleric Terry Waite. A decade later Sutherland and his family won a $  court judgment against Iran for its support of Hezbollah. The damages were paid out of Iranian assets frozen in the wake of the fall of the Shah. Sutherland gave much of his settlement to charity though he liked to joke that he lived his life ?on extended vacation paid for by the shah of Iran. ? John W. Vessey (b. 1922) began his U. S. Army career as a private and eventually rose to become a   general and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Ronald Reagan. Born in Minneapolis Minnesota Vessey lied about his age in 1939 to enlist in the Minnesota National Guard as a private 13 months before he graduated high school. He got his first taste of combat in 1942 as a first sergeant in North Africa calling it the ?toughest job he ever had. ? A year later he won a battlefield promotion to second lieutenant at the Battle of Anzio. He remained in the army after the war ended but did not see combat again until Vietnam. In the 1960s while he was in his forties he earned a bachelor?s degree from the University of Maryland and a master?s degree from George Washington University. During his service in Vietnam in 1966 and 1967 he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery helping to fend off an attack on an American firebase. He later served as the commander of U. S. troops in South Korea and helped persuade President Jimmy Carter to reverse his decision to withdraw U. S. ground forces from the country. In 1981 Reagan made Vessey his pick for chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. As chairman he oversaw tremendous growth in military spending and encouraged Reagan to pursue what became the Strategic Defense Initiative or ?Star Wars. ? When Vessey retired in 1985 his 46 years of service made him the   member of the U. S. Army. In 2003 the Council on Foreign Relations created the General John W. Vessey Chair in Conflict Prevention to honor General Vessey?s service to his country by encouraging the development of strategies for preventing conflict around the globe. Other Americans who had an impact on foreign policy and who died in 2016 include: Sidney Drell a particle physicist and defense intellectual who for more than 40 years advised presidents on nuclear weapons and arms control issues Benjamin Gilman a   congressman who chaired the House International Relations Committee from 1995 to 2000 John Glenn the first American to orbit the earth and a   U. S. senator from Ohio who flew back into space at the age of 77 Michael Herr a journalist and the author of one of the best memoirs of the Vietnam War Dispatches Gene La Rocque a U. S. Navy admiral who in retirement   the Center for Defense Information which was often critical of U. S defense policy William McNeill a   professor of history at the University of Chicago and the author of The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community which won the 1964 National Book Award for history Robert B. Morgan a U. S. senator from North Carolina whose vote in favor of the Panama Canal Treaty likely cost him his Senate seat Jeremiah O?Keefe a U. S. Navy pilot who became an ?ace? in his first battle when he shot down five Japanese planes over Okinawa Alvin Toffler a futurologist and author of the mega best seller Future Shock and Yutaka Yoshida a   police officer in Honolulu who was required to round up Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor and who fought with distinction with the U. S. Army in Europe. Bardia Vaseghi and Jonathan Levitt assisted in the preparation of this post. This post appears courtesy of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
406,73215,The Irony of Inclusivity,Atlantic,Hayley Glatter,12/30/2016,2016,12,,This is the fifth ?  and final ?  installment in our series examining the intersections of education and entertainment in 2016. Read previous entries on a documentary   comedy a play and animated movies. If the national conversation was somehow lacking an entertaining indictment of school hallways filled with hollow calls for inclusivity the ABC sitcom Speechless certainly fills the void. The Scott Silveri show is notable not only because ?  as David Perry wrote for The Atlantic in September ?  it centers around a character and an actor with a disability but also because its satirical take on what an open and welcoming academic community looks like is particularly poignant in 2016. Students and teachers at the fictional Lafayette High School were very excited for its newest pupil J. J. DiMeo (Micah Fowler) who has cerebral palsy to arrive. And they wanted the DiMeo family to be completely sure of this excitement. The principal tells the DiMeos about an   assembly planned for the afternoon of his first day an entire classroom applauds J. J. when he shows up to learn and one student (whose ?cousin is deaf so he gets it?) presents him with a giant poster that reads ?J. J. for president. ? These gestures though ostensibly   are forced to the point of discomfort. Everyone in the   high school is so busy telling J. J. he?s welcome that at first they turn him into a spectacle and the spotlight is searing. From the very start of the show it is deliberately clear that for all their calls for a welcoming and open environment the students and teachers of J. J.?s new high school struggle to implement the integration they?re so passionate about. The principal is overwhelmingly supportive of the DiMeos nominally but when Maya DiMeo (Minnie Driver) ?  J. J.?s loving and exceedingly overbearing mother ?  expresses frustration that the wheelchair ramp her son is using is made for garbage the administrator is well Speechless. And when the school throws an underwhelming bonfire in the gymnasium because the beach version wasn?t wheelchair accessible the reasonably disappointed students ultimately decide after an open conversation that they should be mad at J. J. for ruining this rite of passage after all wouldn?t they blame any other student for the turn of events? Isn?t it the friendly and fair thing to single out J. J.? Much like many conversations about inclusivity that actually happen in America?s schools these actions grasp desperately at sincerity. But ultimately they?re stilted. They?re awkward. And they?re obvious. Speechless ?  with its participation trophies and excessive praise for mediocre work ?  takes the trope of liberal Californians? commitment to accessible safe spaces to its logical extreme. And if you?ve read even one story about coddled millennials working to make sure everyone feels welcome you?ll recognize the smug   glance Speechless pays to this line of rhetoric and those who criticize it. Additionally the fictional high school is so    with its acceptance of J. J. that the characters? deliberate obliviousness to the school?s racial homogeneity is equally as present in every episode. J. J.?s aide Kenneth (Cedric Yarbrough) is the only character of color in the main cast and viewers will struggle to find a   student in Lafayette?s hallways. When Kenneth deliberately points out his blackness other characters do not respond. Instead Kenneth?s race is only addressed when he and J. J. become ?inspirations? for strangers wondering ?who?s really helping who?? Though J. J.?s classmates and teachers work to create a legitimately welcoming atmosphere for him their ignorance of the school?s racial exclusivity is all the more damning and contemporarily relevant. The show?s acknowledgement of these ironies is deliberate and omnipresent but never crass nor mean spirited. For all the overwrought ink spilled on the hypersensitivity of college campuses and the narratives of inclusivity that dominate politics Speechless is remarkable in how relevant its portrayals of diversity efforts feel. The behaviors of the school?s characters in the show are incredibly cliche but that?s precisely the point. In what is a very   Hollywood trope Speechless presents viewers with the chance to decide what a ?normal?   experience is in practically every scene. But alongside that determination is the insistence that the audience examine who they may have left out in conceptualizing that normality. Ultimately Speechless is a comedy that elicits more knowing smirks than   moments. The calls for openness do feel genuine in the end even if a hallway full of teens cheering on inclusivity is forcibly   . At first it seems as if the characters are only interested in inclusivity when it?s convenient. However not once does the show allow anyone to ?save? J. J. there is no need for a nice kid to bravely rescue him from bullies. J. J. and his disability are at the center of the show and the program?s parody of politically correct progressivism is appropriately snide. And yet in a polarized environment the organic friendships J. J. cultivates with his classmates are honest heartwarming and put into conversation with contemporary issues of integration and equality tragically wistful.
407,73216,2016 Summed Up in a Word,Atlantic,Anna Diamond,12/30/2016,2016,12,,It?s not easy to sum up the past year in a single word even if you stick to one language. Take for example the competing ?word of the year? offerings of various online   dictionaries.   chose ?surreal? based on spikes in lookups of the word at different points over the year including the terrorist attacks in Brussels and Nice the coup attempt in Turkey and the U. S. presidential election. Dictionary. com?s entry picked to ?embody a major theme resonating deeply in the cultural consciousness? was ?xenophobia? a term that saw similar surges in lookups amid persistent ?fear of the other. ? Cambridge Dictionary?s winner for ?the biggest increase in searches? to its website during the past year was ?paranoid? a word that ?suggests perhaps a feeling that the institutions that have kept us safe can no longer be trusted that the world feels more uncertain than it did a year ago. ? Oxford Dictionary opted for ? ? ?  defined as ?relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief? ?  based in part on its increasing frequency of use in 2016. Elsewhere though the words summarizing the past 12 months aren?t as dark. In Japan for instance an organization that promotes the use of the country?s kanji writing system selected kin which means ?money? or ?gold? as its kanji character of the year. The choice was based on votes from the public (kin is a crowd favorite having won the contest twice before in 2000 and 2012). Among the reasons voters listed for backing kin: Japan?s success at the 2016 Rio Olympics where the country netted 12 gold medals a scandal surrounding the Tokyo governor?s misuse of public funds and the U. S.  ?s hair color. (The elaborate golden setting of the first meeting between Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also comes to mind.) 2016: The Year in Quotes Norway?s Language Council the state agency for language policy along with Gisle Andersen a professor at the Norwegian School of Economics went with hverdagsintegrering which translates to ?everyday integration. ? The choice was inspired by Prime Minister Erna Solberg?s 2016 New Year?s speech in which she noted how instability around the world had spurred increased migration to Norway. Solberg recommended advancing integration through small steps ?  ranging from parents offering their children?s refugee classmates rides to soccer practice to employers not overlooking applicants with unfamiliar names. (In the months preceding the speech more than 30 000   had arrived in Norway according to the country?s Central Bureau of Statistics.) Each year in China an online poll conducted by the National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center the Commercial Press and the People?s Daily Online highlights a handful of trendy words and phrases. 2016?s character of the year was gui which translates to ?rule? or ?regulation. ? As Haifeng Huang a professor at UC Merced explained in an interview the selection ?likely reflects the Chinese state?s increasing control over Chinese society as well as [its] recentralization of power in recent years? including a massive campaign by Chinese President Xi Jinping to root out corruption from the Communist Party. The word of the year xiao mubiao or ?small goal? comes courtesy of China?s richest man Wang Jianlin. In an interview earlier this year he offered a piece of advice: ?Set a small goal first for example earn 100 million yuan to start with!? (100 million yuan is roughly $14 million.) The not especially relatable or helpful guidance was met with plenty of amusement online where it became shorthand for an impossible goal. But Huang said the expression can also be used somewhat sincerely. For an ?optimistic society with decent upward mobility? he explained ?this phrase may represent a humorous but hopeful take on the future. ? Austria?s vote for its largely ceremonial presidency gave us bundespraesidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung which translates to ?the delay in the repetition of the presidential  . ? The word surfaced in a poll by the Research Unit for Austrian German and the Austria Press Agency. The Associated Press breaks down the   and   process that the word describes: ?A first round in April was followed by a May runoff between the two most popular candidates. This was annulled because of irregularities. A new date set for October was then postponed because of faulty absentee ballots to Dec. 4 when the vote was won by Alexander Van der Bellen. ? Austrians ultimately rejected a   candidate Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party which was started by former Nazis in the 1950s. His defeat contrasted with a string of populist upsets in 2016 including the vote for Britain to leave the European Union and Donald Trump?s victory in the U. S. election. The Australian National Dictionary Center for its part recognized the term ?democracy sausage? a ?barbecued sausage served on a slice of bread bought at a polling booth sausage sizzle on election day. ? The Australian federal election campaign this year was unusually long by Australian standards lasting two months. (As Uri Friedman wrote in October this year?s U. S. presidential election by one measure lasted 597 days or nearly 20 months.) By the end of the campaign The Washington Post explains ?some Australians seemed more concerned about the quality of the democracy sausages on offer than the candidates. Social media and websites directed voters to the   polling booths in their neighborhoods. ? Even the appeal of the democracy sausage and the fine assessed for not voting as mandated by Australian law didn?t bring out every eligible Aussie. This year turnout dropped to an   low since voting became a requirement in 1925: a mere 90 percent. (Turnout in the 2016 U. S. election was close to 60 percent.) As the director of the Australian National Dictionary Center Amanda Laugesen said ?Arguably the democracy sausage has been one of the best things to come out of a tumultuous year in politics and political campaigning. ? In other words across borders continents and languages politics and political dysfunction were top of mind this year. It?s enough to make you feel like you?re living through a   bundespraesidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung.
408,73217,Will America?s Nuclear Weapons Always Be Safe From Hackers?,Atlantic,Patrick Tucker,12/30/2016,2016,12,,   Future nuclear missiles may be siloed but unlike their predecessors they?ll exhibit ?some level of connectivity to the rest of the warfighting system? according to Werner J. A. Dahm the chair of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. That opens up new potential for nuclear mishaps that until now have never been a part of Pentagon planning. In 2017 the board will undertake a study to see how to meet those concerns. ?Obviously the Air Force doesn?t conceptualize systems like that without ideas for how they would address those surety concerns? said Dahm. It?s no simple or   undertaking. The last time the United States designed an intercontinental ballistic missile was 1975. At the end of the December the Air Force Science Board announced that in 2017 they would explore safety and practical concerns of making a missile for the modern age along with other nuclear weapons that fall under the command of the Air Force. ?We have a number of nuclear systems that are in need of recapitalization? said Dahm referring to LRSO ICBMs and the   stealth bomber. In the future he said ?these systems are going to be quite different from the ones that they may replace. In particular they will be much more like all systems today network connected. They?ll be cyber enabled. ? That connectivity will create new concerns in terms of safety and certification that will almost certainly require changes or additions to current DoD directives. The study comes at a critical time for the future of U. S. Nuclear Weapons. On December 22 Donald Trump confused and alarmed the world when he tweeted that he would both strengthen and expand America?s nuclear weapons capability. But there was less new in the announcement than might actually appear. In fact the Obama Administration was already working to fullfill the ?strengthening? part of that same promise having already put the United States on track to spend more than $1 trillion on modernization of U. S. nuclear weapons. For the United States Air Force the modernization list includes replacing   Minuteman with a new  intercontinental ballistic missile (also called a   strategic deterrent) developing a controversial   cruise missile called the   standoff weapon or LRSO to building and deploying an entirely new   stealth bomber. What are ?surety concerns??  Read that to mean how do you make sure that your fancy networked nuclear warfare control system can?t be hijacked or go off accidentally. Before the United States can modernize its nuclear weapons it must first make certain it understands everything that can possibly go wrong. Think back to the classic film (and book) Dr. Strangelove a story very much about surety failure. A crazed Air Force general sends his   wing to destroy their targets in the Soviet Union. Of course only the President is supposed to be able to call for a nuclear strike but an obscure contingency plan (Wing Attack Plan R) allows a lower level commander to issue the order in the event that the normal command and control has been disrupted. The Pentagon can?t call back the wing because the   can no longer receive transmissions unless preceded by specific   code that only the general knows part of a poorly   safety scheme to protect the airmen from false orders. Even after the recall code is issued and most of the plans abort their missions one continues on to a new tertiary target as the plane?s radio has been damaged in combat. (Somehow the drafters of Wing Attack Plan R forgot to insert a rule ordering pilots back to base when their radios are damaged rather than continue to target.) The lone   hits its target and sets in motion the end of the world. Surety failure squared. According to Defense Department Directive 3150. 02 which outlines the Air Force?s Nuclear Surety Program. The directive assigns ?responsibilities for DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety for the oversight of safety security and control of U. S. nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems in DoD custody. ? ?We have formal Air Force documents that detail the formal certification process for nuclear weapons. To what extent do the current models for certifying nuclear systems carry over into these modern network enabled systems and how would you   certification for systems that are likely to come out of these recap programs?? asked Dahm. The 2017 Air Force Scientific Advisory Board study will attempt to answer those questions. The board consists of 50 members that are appointed by the Secretary of Defense and are drawn from academia industry and elsewhere. Members serve for four years. The fact that future nuclear weapons will be far more networked (though not necessarily to the open Internet) will create better safety and oversight and allow for more coordinated operations. But more connectivity also introduces new potential vulnerabilities and dangers. ?You have to be able to certify that an adversary can?t take control of that weapon that the weapon will be able to do what it?s supposed to do when you call on it? said Dahm. ?It isn?t just cyber. That?s definitely the biggest piece but   ?     When was the last time we built a new nuclear system? Designed and built one? It?s been several decades now. We as an Air Force haven?t done certification of new nuclear systems in a long time. These systems are different   ?     What are the surety vulnerabilities for such a system so to speak? How would you address them? How would you certify that the system will work when you need it to work and will do what it?s supposed to do?? That?s what the study will cover.

409,73218,The Key to Putin?s Cyber Power,Atlantic,Uri Friedman,12/30/2016,2016,12,,   Michael McFaul Barack Obama?s ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 has a blunt assessment of the actions that his former boss took against the Russian government this week. The sanctions on Russian intelligence officers and organizations along with the expulsion of Russian intelligence officials and closing of Russian compounds in the United States is ?not going to change? Russian President Vladimir Putin?s behavior he told me shortly after the measures were announced. Obama?s retaliation ?  at least the retaliation that the U. S. government has made public ?  isn?t sufficient to deter the Kremlin from interfering in future U. S. elections he said. ?What the Russians Did Was Utterly Unprecedented? But in naming and punishing specific Russian agencies and individuals over the hack and leaks of Democratic emails the president has McFaul hopes put to rest the ?debate about whether the Russians were interfering in our presidential election. ? Which is why he?s so frustrated by Donald Trump?s continued insistence that the country ?move on? from the Russian cyber campaign. That campaign represents a threat to the sovereignty President Trump will be sworn to protect he said. One message of Obama?s actions McFaul added is that this threat didn?t disappear on Election Day and it won?t disappear on Inauguration Day. The standard way to understand a threat is to evaluate intent and capability to cause harm. And in the cyber domain McFaul explained Russia has both in spades. What distinguishes Putin from other world leaders is that he?s ?not afraid to use this stuff. ? McFaul was America?s man in Moscow during a pivotal moment in the U. S.  relationship: after disputed elections in Russia convinced Putin that the United States was trying to undermine him but just before Russia?s military intervention in Ukraine. While McFaul defended Obama?s record on Russia he admitted that the administration was initially slow to respond to Russian aggression. And he acknowledged that in the waning days of Obama?s presidency relations between the two countries are in a ?precarious? state. ?The Soviet Union did not annex territory? he noted. ?That?s something new. The Soviet Union did not meddle in [America?s] electoral affairs at least to the extent and as successfully as they did this time. That?s something new. ? An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows. Uri Friedman: In your view is this a tough enough response by the Obama administration to Russia?s cyber campaign during the election? Michael McFaul: Well I?m pleased there is a response. This is a very important marker to put down especially before the Obama administration leaves office. For me the most important thing is actually not the sanctions. The most important thing is the attribution that the administration had to do in order to put these entities and these people on sanctions. There are still many Americans millions of Americans including maybe even our   [who refuse] to believe that anything even happened. This action I think should end forever [the] debate about whether the Russians were interfering in our presidential election. Friedman: What is it about the level of attribution that you feel ends the debate? McFaul: You don?t punish an individual or an organization unless you have overwhelming evidence of what they did. And especially this administration and this president somebody I used to work with ?  he would never do this unless the evidence was absolutely overwhelming.   An important part of what the administration was trying to communicate [was]: This is a real threat. It didn?t end [with Election Day] on November 8 and it won?t end with the inauguration of President Trump. [It is] naive to think ?Well [the Russians] just do this stuff because tensions are high but when we get to a detente with Russia this will end. ? Friedman: The U. S. already has sanctions in place against Russia for Russia?s military intervention in Ukraine. What?s the marginal impact of additional sanctions? Do you think it actually hurts Russia economically? McFaul: I don?t think so to be honest not this set of sanctions. I don?t think that?s the intention. The intention is to exact a cost and to attribute this attack to those entities and those individuals. The Obama administration understands that this relatively small number of entities and people sanctioned is not going to have an economic impact. It?s not going to change Putin?s behavior especially because Putin not without reason believes that he?s going to have an opportunity to roll back the sanctions with the next [U. S.] administration. Friedman: You spent a couple years in Moscow as the ambassador to Russia. You know the Kremlin up close. How do you expect the Russian government to respond to these measures? What do you think Vladimir Putin is thinking and doing right now? McFaul: They?ll reciprocate without question. With respect to sanctions they have a somewhat different policy [than the U. S. does] which is they respond in their words ?commensurately? but they don?t always respond publicly. There are many more Americans on their sanctions list than we know publicly. I myself found that out just a few weeks ago ?  that I?d been on the list for a couple years. And I only found out when I tried to get a visa. In Moscow there?s lots of anticipation of the new era working with President Trump. So I wouldn?t predict a big blowup that [Trump] would feel compelled to respond to. [The Russians] want to begin the era of lifting sanctions not deepening sanctions. I do think that?s going to be harder for the  . [The Obama administration?s actions are] a response to a   threat. The entire government is on board there?s no division. For him to come in and reverse what they did he?s going to have to have a   explanation for why he?s doing that. There will be people extremely upset who work in our intelligence community if just in the name of getting along with Russia we reverse this. Friedman: [On Wednesday] when asked about retaliation against Russia Donald Trump said ?We ought to get on with our lives. ? With these measures that the Obama administration has taken to what degree will he be able to get on with his plan for better relations with Russia? McFaul: The most important thing is I hope he never says that again. [Trump released a statement saying something similar minutes after I got off the phone with McFaul.] [There?s] overwhelming data now complete with sanctioning those individuals that they?ve identified that the Russians interfered in our presidential election. As the president of the United States you?re in charge of national security. So we don?t just get on with our lives. I don?t want to make the comparison that others did to September 11 or a terrorist attack because I think those are inappropriate analogies but [the Russian cyber campaign] is a threat to our sovereignty and I hope this will help to convince [Trump] of that. If nothing more that would be a very important objective achieved. Having said all that he has tremendous leeway as president to change the course of foreign policy and to try to get along with Russia. Now I personally believe that he has not developed a strategy toward Russia yet. To get along with Russia or any other country is not a strategy. It shouldn?t be a goal of U. S. foreign policy ever. You?re getting along and then what? [Putin] throws you a nice party at the Kremlin and then what? What does he want to achieve in terms of American security interests or American economic interests? Friedman: Fight ISIS right? McFaul: But it turns out we?re already fighting ISIS and the Russians are not. To be fair that would be one [goal]. If he said ?In the interests of getting the Russians to fight ISIS this is what I?m prepared to do in terms of getting along. ? I would disagree with that strategy but at least that would be a strategy. Friedman: Do you think [Barack Obama?s] measures are sufficient to deter Russia from launching a similar cyber campaign against the U. S. or its allies in the future? McFaul: In and of itself ?  what was done [on Thursday] publicly ?  my answer would be no. If part of a broader campaign of 1) attribution 2) deterrence and 3) resilience then this could be the beginning of a much more effective cybersecurity strategy. With respect to attribution I think this is a big step. With respect to deterrence I think what we know is a small step but better than nothing. With respect to resilience we haven?t even begun that debate or conversation. Friedman: What do you mean by resilience? McFaul: To make it harder for them to do these things in the future. To build up our defenses ?  not just deterring offense but to actually have the ability to protect U. S. government officials. I think most people would be shocked at the tremendous capacity that the Russians have with respect to all things cyber in America: government business personal. Friedman: Do you think they?re the number one cyber power in the world right now? McFaul: Well we?re number one. But in terms of capability they most certainly are extremely capable. And the thing that Putin has that other countries don?t have is he?s got the intention too. He?s not afraid to use this stuff in the ways that he has. It would be unthinkable from my perspective at least for the Obama administration to steal Russian data and then use it in a way to manipulate an electoral process in Russia. [Obama] just would never do that. [Putin] has proven that he has both the capability and the will to do things like that. And not just against the United States but against lots of countries. Friedman: On numbers two and three ?  deterrence and resilience ?  Obama?s got weeks left in [his] administration. That?s a task for a new administration right? McFaul: Correct. Friedman: You get the impression [these days] that you?re in a Cold War time warp. Help us put this in historical context. How does this effort to punish Russia compare in scale to similar U. S. actions in the past? McFaul: It?s an apples and oranges thing. We?re most certainly not in a Cold War with Russia because we?re not fighting an ideology that seeks to conquer the world. We?re not fighting proxy wars against each other around the world although some may say we?re fighting a proxy war in Syria right now. So that?s how things are different. President Putin definitely sees the United States as an enemy. He sees us as propagating values that he thinks undermine Russia and Russian national interests. [That?s] a parallel to an earlier period in the Cold War. It always felt to me when I was in government that it was one side fighting. [The United States] had fought real wars after the Cold War: Afghanistan and Iraq. So we weren?t trapped in fighting the old Cold War. But [the Russians] always were. But there are things that are more sinister. The Soviet Union did not annex territory [as Russia did in 2014 with Crimea]. That?s something new. The Soviet Union did not meddle in [America?s] electoral affairs at least to the extent and as successfully as they did this time. That?s something new. The Obama administration?s response to that also goes beyond anything we saw in the Cold War. The sanctions put in place after Russia annexed Crimea and supported the separatists in Ukraine go way beyond any [sanctions] you ever saw in the Cold War. It?s a uniquely challenging moment. Maybe it will all change [to] a different dynamic in a few weeks. Friedman: I spoke with Representative Adam Schiff last week about the election hack and he advocated covert retaliation against Russia in addition to sanctions including efforts to expose corruption on the part of Putin and his inner circle. What additional measures would you like to see the U. S. government pursue in the [Obama administration?s] final weeks? McFaul: One last thing would be to endorse the idea of a bipartisan independent commission modeled after the   Commission to get much deeper investigation [into] what happened but also how we responded to what the Russians did. [The   Commission] wasn?t set up to blame the Bush administration for what happened but to dig deep with a lot of authority and resources and declassified information as a way to help us avoid the next catastrophic terrorist attack. That?s really important because [the Obama administration?s retaliation] is not enough. We won?t be ready for 2020 if we just say ?OK we?re done with this. ? Again capability and intent are different. And we can?t predict what Russian intentions or Chinese intentions or Silicon Valley rogue groups with the same capacities ?  we don?t know those intentions in 2020. But the capabilities we have a pretty good sense of. And the capabilities are only going to get better unless we do something much more serious to protect the integrity of our electoral process.   Friedman: When Mitt Romney described Russia as America?s ?number one geopolitical foe? during the 2012 election Obama mocked him saying ?the 1980s are calling to ask for their foreign policy back. ? A couple years later [Obama] dismissed Russia as a weak ?regional power. ? Is what we?re seeing this week a     attempt by the Obama administration to address a serious threat after years of underestimating it? McFaul: I disagree with that. I was in the Obama administration for five years. I think what we did in the beginning in terms of engagement with Russia was right. And we achieved a lot. To use the  ?s language we got some big deals done. We got the START [  reduction] treaty done. We got sanctions on Iran. We got a new supply route to Afghanistan. We got Russia into the [World Trade Organization]. All of those things are good for America. We didn?t change our policy. Putin changed his policy because he became paranoid about Color Revolutions first in the Arab world and then in Russia itself [in 2011] and then later in Ukraine in 2014. There was nothing we could do. I sat there and watched us try to convince him that we were not orchestrating these revolutions against either his allies or him and we couldn?t convince him. Now could we have responded a little bit faster? My answer to that is yeah. We probably tried too hard to keep cooperating with the Russians in 2012 and we probably responded a little bit too slowly to what happened in Crimea. But those are marginal calls. I think there?s been a strong but measured response to Russian belligerent behavior in Ukraine inside Russia in Syria and in our own election. I worry now given what the   has said that he?s going to forget all those things and in the name of getting along look the other way [from] very egregious acts of Russian aggression. We?re at a pretty precarious moment right now.
410,73219,U.S. Law Enforcement Fatalities Increased In 2016 ,Atlantic,Clare Foran,12/30/2016,2016,12,,Deadly shootings and ambush attacks contributed to a   high in   fatalities in the United States in 2016 according to data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund a   organization based in Washington D. C. ?He Was the Nationalist Candidate? There were 135 officers killed on the job this year and   incidents were the leading cause of death a report released on Thursday indicates. Ambush attacks on officers took place in 21 of the 64 total shooting fatalities which the memorial fund notes is ?the highest total in more than two decades. ? One of the most   ambush attacks occurred in Dallas Texas in July when five police officers were fatally shot. According to Dallas Police Chief David Brown the gunman told negotiators that ?he wanted to kill white people especially white officers? and had been disturbed by ?recent police shootings. ? The ambush followed peaceful protests of fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling  in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota both of whom were black men. Three police officers were later killed in Baton Rouge Louisiana in an another ambush in July. Texas California Louisiana Georgia and Michigan were the five deadliest states for   agents according to the report based on the total number of officer fatalities in each state. The uptick in officer fatalities took place amid calls for greater police accountability in response to lethal shootings of black men and women by police. Activism against police brutality has become a rallying cry of the Black Lives Matter   movement which rose to prominence following the death of   old Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson Missouri in 2014. 955 individuals have been fatally shot by police officers this year according to data compiled by The Washington Post. Heightened police scrutiny has led some officers to suggest they feel more likely to face attack. ?Blue Lives Matter? has emerged as a counter cry in defense of law enforcement agents. And during his campaign for president Donald Trump took pains to cast himself as a champion of police officers. ?An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans? he declared in his acceptance of the Republican presidential nomination. Trump talked of ?threats and violence against our law enforcement officials? and promised to ?restore law and order to our country. ? But although Trump has painted a vision of a chaotic and dangerous America as my colleague Matt Ford has pointed out the crime rate has decreased significantly in the United States over the past 25 years. At the same time 135 reported officer deaths for 2016 remains below the average annual number of law enforcement fatalities during the past decade which was 151 between 2006 to 2015 according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Data compiled by the memorial fund shows an overall decline in law enforcement fatalities since the 1970s. Total fatalities for this year are also less than in 1930 the deadliest year on record for officers according to the memorial fund when 307   officers were slain.
411,73220,How to Stop Short-Term Thinking at America?s Companies,Atlantic,Alana Semuels,12/30/2016,2016,12,,There was a time half a century ago when what was good for many American corporations tended to also be good for America. Companies invested in their workers and new technologies and as a result they prospered and their employees did too. Now a growing group of business leaders is worried that companies are too concerned with   profits focused only on making money for shareholders. As a result they?re not investing in their workers in research or in technology ?    costs that would reduce profits temporarily. And this the business leaders say may be creating   problems for the nation. ?Too many CEOs play the quarterly game and manage their businesses accordingly? Paul Polman the CEO of the   conglomerate Unilever told me. ?But many of the world?s challenges can not be addressed with a quarterly mindset. ? Polman is one of a group of CEOs and business leaders that have signed onto the American Prosperity Project an initiative spearheaded by the Aspen Institute to encourage companies and the nation to engage in more   thinking. The group which includes CEOs such as Chip Bergh of Levi Strauss and Ian Read of Pfizer board directors such as Janet Hill of Wendy?s and Stanley Bergman of Henry Schein Inc. and labor leaders such as Damon Silvers of the   have issued a report encouraging the government to make it easier for companies to think in the   by investing in infrastructure and changing both the tax code and corporate governance laws. ?America?s incentive system for   investment is broken? the report argues. Data bears this out. The average holding time for stocks has fallen from eight years in 1960 to eight months in 2016. Almost 80 percent of chief financial officers at 400 of America?s largest public companies say they would sacrifice a firm?s economic value to meet the quarter?s earnings expectations. And companies are spending more and more on purchasing their own shares to drive stock prices up rather than investing in equipment or employees. Polman who has been the CEO since 2009 told me that he sees business leaders managing spending from quarter to quarter and pushing sales at the end of quarterly reporting periods if numbers are off. (This dynamic backfired at Wells Fargo where employees pressured to meet quarterly targets opened accounts without customers? permission.) Companies engage in ?financial manipulation? he said to post better quarterly profits and don?t spend money on costly investments that might make their businesses do better in the long term. Business leaders afraid that shareholders will oust them if quarterly profits dip aim for earnings at the expense of anything else. (For an   look at one company that slashed research at the demands of  investors read my story on DuPont.) ?The strategy ends up being focused on the shareholders versus other stakeholders? he told me. ?If ultimately the purpose of a company is maximizing shareholder return we risk ending up with many decisions that are not in the interest of society. ? There are a few reasons why   has become more prevalent in America. There?s a growing culture of analysts and traders obsessing over a company?s quarterly performance and panicking if a company posts poor quarterly results. This culture has been enabled by the availability of information about companies on the Internet and television but it has also arisen because traders? compensation is tied to how their holdings perform every year. The recession amplified this culture ?  so many funds lost money during that time period that they too began encouraging the people who manage their money to try and make it up in the short term. Often shareholders advocate against leaders of companies that may post a year of poor profits even if that company could perform very well over a   period. CEOs and other executives often have their pay tied to annual performance meaning they personally benefit from   profits too. The Aspen Institute and its signatories have come out with a framework that they hope will discourage this kind of   thinking.   thinking is bad for America they say because the country?s economic health depends on   investments that will pay out over time. What?s more they argue   thinking shouldn?t be paramount for the majority of investors most equity is held by pension funds and other institutional investors who need their assets to perform well over the long haul. Large institutions hold nearly 70 percent of all equity issued in public markets today up from 8 percent held by such institutions in 1950. Many of the recommendations revolve around the policies that influence how companies spend their money. Currently for instance companies can defer taxes on foreign income until they repatriate that income which discourages them from bringing the money back into the U. S. If the U. S. taxed multinational firms based on the share of worldwide sales that occur in the U. S. (a policy called formulary apportionment) that might discourage firms from locating operations overseas simply to lower their tax burden. Another tax change would be to allow ?bonus depreciation? a policy that would allow half of investment in equipment to be deducted immediately rather than over a period of time. This was a policy enacted during the stimulus a 2013 bill sponsored by Harry Reid proposed making it permanent. The signatories also call for increased government spending so that companies can feel secure that they?re operating in a country that supports investment and productivity. This includes $200 billion of infrastructure investment per year. ?If the airports are crummy and basic transportation is inadequate we?re not supporting the system that makes it possible for goods and people to move easily? Judy Samuelson the executive director of the Aspen Institute?s business and society program told me. The government could also raise money for research through a financial transactions tax which would simultaneously curb the rapid trading done by some on Wall Street to earn quick money rather than invest in companies for the long term the report argues. Some of the recommendations focus on other ways to incentivize investors to hold onto assets for longer. Currently assets held for less than one year are taxed as income but assets held for a year or more are treated as   investments and taxed at a lower rate of 15 percent. Increasing the amount of time that investors must hold an asset so that it can be taxed as a   holding could encourage more investors to think about the   the report argues. An alternative would be to tax holdings on a gradual scale in which assets held for a short time are taxed at a higher rate and those held for a long time are taxed at a lower one. Perhaps most compelling of the American Prosperity Project recommendations are those that companies can undertake on their own. After all Congress has been and will likely be locked in gridlock going forward and it?s doubtful it will take up bills that address corporate taxation or tax incentives in the new session. So instead there are recommendations in the report that individual companies can implement if they truly want to put an end to  . They include giving enhanced shareholder voting rights to investors who hang onto stocks for the long term and voting on executive pay in a longer time frame so that executives? incentives aren?t aligned with the need to post big quarterly gains. They also include discouraging   earnings guidance so that companies can focus more on the long term. Companies can after all refuse to issue earnings guidance and only share financial information when they issue quarterly reports and other financial statements. There are a few companies that have already tried to undertake some of these recommendations on their own. Unilever is one. When Polman became CEO in 2009 he told investors that Unilever would stop issuing quarterly earnings guidance so that the company could focus more on the long term. The market punished Polman for doing so According to Bloomberg Unilever stock dropped 22 percent after his announcement compared to the 16 percent experienced by The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index. Since then the company has taken on some   ideas buying companies including Seventh Generation and Dollar Shave Club and investing over a billion dollars in its U. S. factories. It may be difficult to get other companies to follow. After all few other company CEOs likely have a worldview similar to that of Polman?s who is   for his independent streak. ?Ultimately the purpose of a company is to serve society and in doing so shareholders will equally benefit over time? he told me. Many heads of companies by contrast believe that they have a duty to serve shareholders and hope that the company will benefit over time. This is a mistaken assumption ?  as Cornell professor Lynn Stout has argued in her book The Shareholder Value Myth: How Putting Shareholders First Harms Investors Corporations and the Public. CEOs think they have to put shareholders first but they can put the interests of society first if they choose. Still many CEOs personally benefit when they act on behalf of shareholders the way they are paid and evaluated depends on   success. It?s likely that their incentives will need to change before they act to stop   on their own.
412,73221,Obama?s Faith in White America Was Not Misplaced ,Atlantic,Daniel Foster,12/30/2016,2016,12,,Over the next few weeks The Atlantic will be publishing a series of responses to   Coates?s story ?My President Was Black.? Readers are invited to send their own responses to hello@theatlantic. com and we will post a sample of your feedback. You can read other responses to the story from Atlantic readers and contributors here. I deeply dislike the man whose victory may vacate ?   ?  who in some sense already has vacated ?   ?  Obama?s legacy. I dislike that man as much as I can dislike anyone I never have and never will meet and I condemn a great deal of what his partisans imagine he stands for. But I have never hated President Obama. Not even a little. I found him frustrating and wrongheaded. And of course I wanted him to lose twice. But I never doubted his basic honor nor failed to appreciate the import of the very fact of his presidency. I watched with ?  is there such a thing as begrudging awe? ?  the jubilee in Chicago in 2008. I retweeted tiny Virginia McLaurin born ten years before the 19th amendment and 45 before Brown vs. Board dancing with the Obamas in the Blue Room. The breath caught in my throat when the little boy asked if he could touch the hair.   Coates?s president was black. So was mine. But if even I the abominable shared the odd moment of wonder with Coates during Obama?s presidency I also glumly share his pessimism at its end. Because for all the joy he invests in the personages of the Obamas Coates?s essay is an autopsy. Obamaism is dead Coates argues because Obama bought into America?s founding myths instead of dismantling them because he cut unapologetic celebrations of blackness with genuflections to respectability politics because he offered white America a vision that ?reinforce[d] the majoritarian dream? by erasing ?the nightmare endured by the minority. ? Coates allows that Obama who had ?the luxury of becoming black with minimal trauma? came to his views authentically. Indeed the ?hybridity? of Obama?s biography his trust in and comfort amidst white America his sincere embrace of its republican assumptions his basic optimism put him in ?the only tradition in existence that could have possibly put a black person in the White House. ? But the price of victory was that in critical moments the president was blinkered by those assumptions and so could not glimpse the essential   reparative politics that lay beyond them. This story told under many glosses in Coates?s work is positively Sophoclean in its gray determinism: False consciousness enmeshes black bodies in an evil order that in turn foreordains their failure. And Coates offers an added helping of the dialectical with his casual assurance that Obama?s victories somehow necessitated the  ?s. That 2016 wasn?t even just a racist reaction but a restoration ?  America regaining its bigoted equilibrium after a minor perturbation. This highly stylized psychohistory of blackness and whiteness in America is at the very least unhelpful and probably false. Likewise Coates?s appraisal of Obama?s legacy seems to me both unduly Whiggish and unfair. Whiggish in that Obama never in fact lived up to the promise of his early ecumenical republicanism ?  unfair in its implication that that promise was never worth making. By Coates?s lights it was the 2004 keynote at the Democratic National Convention that established Obama?s commitment to ?the literature of prospective presidents? over the literature of ?the struggle? that is to a literature that speaks ?not to gravity and reality but to aspirations and dreams? a winsome promise of no more white America or black America but only a United States of America. In the years that followed that address nabobs swooned and mouthed words like ?Lincolnian? progressives and Blue Dogs alike found favorable timbres in his slogans the fabled Obamacons saw a way up and out of a divisive and diminished administration and broader swaths still saw a man who might yet free Americans from their racial baggage. But in 2016 ?  hell in 2010 ?  that speech and the lore it produced seem from a bygone era and the Obama who spoke of unity looks little like the Obama who ruled by a tenacious majoritarianism ?  whose great accomplishments were scaffolded by perverse exertions of executive power and the uncut goonery of Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. In the interval progressive politics at its loudest became about Twitter burns from baccalaureates armed with   Critical Theory and looking for scores to settle. The president himself never sank to this level and admirably       on campus and elsewhere. But nevertheless under his watch the Left disappeared up its own fundament replacing Obama?s sober ecumenicalism with a series of diminishingly original comedians on increasingly obscure cable networks snarking to camera about unflattering images of Ted Cruz projected over their shoulders. This   of the Left proceeded apace with the construction on the Right of a kind of discursive ark a place of refuge fueled by an emergent Tea Party and a waxing Fox News. In due course the   panopticon of social media helped produce hermetically sealed political ontologies on the Left and Right completely   and utterly irreconcilable. The politics of demonization gave way to something even worse: politics as onanism. How else to explain   culture or the Mizzou protesters who didn?t want their protests covered or the Black Lives Matter activists who deemed a meeting at the White House counterproductive to the movement or the blunderbuss nihilism of the Republican nominee?s campaign rallies. All of this is very bad. Most of it is not proximately the president?s fault. But even the bits of it that arguably are are not the result of his excess faith in the American promise any more than it was reverence for  ?  liberal democracy that catapulted the latest inchoate plurality to victory. It?s true that there was plenty of racist opposition to Obama and it?s true that the   has the support of many racists both brazen and shy. But one can?t pin Hillary Clinton?s loss solely on racist blowback. Electoral landslides are easy to account for squeakers are overdetermined. The nature of the  ?s win was so narrow and his path to it so bizarre that there is an infinite supply of counterfactuals that credibly explain it. It seems to me then trivially true that if there were fewer racists in America Hillary Clinton would be president elect. Just as it seems trivially true that she?d be president elect if she?d used a State Department email server or advocated a   energy policy or visited Wisconsin and Michigan a dozen times more each. But it also seems plausible that most of the white people who voted for both Obama and his successor and whom Coates counts among the ?badge holders? of white privilege don?t imagine themselves privileged. That they don?t know what ?white innocence? is or could possibly mean. That Hillary Clinton?s loss is not a sign that America is irredeemably bigoted. In an elegant bit of rhetoric Coates argues that Obama had to be exceptional to win while all the   needed was ?white bluster. ? But he?ll no doubt be aware that by curriculum vitae candidate Obama was not exceptional in 2008 a fact pointed out by both John McCain and Hillary Clinton. What?s more all of the pathologies that led by Coates?s account to the rejection of Obamaism were as present in 2012 as in 2016. And in 2012 voters were even presented with an alternative to Obamaism in Mitt Romney a man white in all ways who as his opponents would have it even hated women and minorities if you applied enough brute hermeneutic force to his rhetoric. If white America?s original sin remains uncleansed if Obama were really such an aberrance how strange it is that America rejected him only when he stopped appearing on the ballot? The racism Coates sees in America is constitutive metaphysical. He?s quick to assign collective intentionality to white people to spot white supremacy across individuals and contexts and epochs to practice rhetorically the same   essentialism that got us here in the first place. White supremacy is both the great evil at the heart of the American order and inseverable from it. Cut it off and you lose the patient. Coates?s charge is that Obama had to ignore this to govern. And on that score he is absolutely correct. If America?s racial agony is coded into our alleles there is very little to be done about it within the   budget window. But in place of Coates?s imagined     conspiracy I?d posit something a bit more parsimonious. That while injustices accrue systemically caring about them has to be done individually. Plenty of Americans brown and white care plenty of the time. They care when confronted with video of Walter Scott?s murder or toddlers? lifeless corpses in Aleppo. They care about tsunamis in countries they can?t place on maps and they cared on Edmund Pettus Bridge when caring meant skin in the game. But they care in fits and starts when they can spare the psychic energy. When their kids are fed and their own anxieties subdued. This is how it has always been and how it will always be. There?s nothing criminally white or indelibly American about the localism of our hearts or the limits of their capacity for grief even if this feature leaves some dreams unduly deferred. This localism is woven into the fabric of our republican order. It endows us with structures that allow individuals to freely pursue rival conceptions of the good structures that imagine their equality before law abstracted from the accidents of their birth. If that imagining slows the achievement of some restitutive justices ?  however   or   ?  that a more nakedly sectarian politics would otherwise hasten then it falls on all of us to take a basic stand on whether that baby is worth the bath water. Despite our legion of disagreements I never doubted the president?s position on this matter. Coates opens with F. Scott Fitzgerald so I?ll close with him. This from an obscure and otherwise mediocre short story called ?The Swimmers? is one of my favorite things anyone has ever written and I?ll use just about any excuse to repeat it in print: France was a land England was a people but America having about it still that quality of the idea was harder to utter   it was the graves at Shiloh and the tired drawn nervous faces of its great men and the country boys dying in the Argonne for a phrase that was empty before their bodies withered. It was a willingness of the heart. I think of that famous picture of Jesse Owens at the Olympic podium in Berlin standing under a laurel crown above a couple of fascists right hand raised in a defiant salute to a country as keen to string him up as raise him up. If America furnished some of the uncomfortable contradictions in this picture of Owens did it not also furnish his willing heart?  
413,73222,Obama?s Environmental Legacy in Two Buttes,Atlantic,Robinson Meyer,12/30/2016,2016,12,,When historians go searching for the encapsulating symbol of President Obama?s environmental legacy ?  and all the idealism and ire that accompanied it ?  they need look no further than two buttes rising from the desert in southeastern Utah. On Wednesday with a stroke of his pen Obama created the Bears Ears National Monument. The monument grants federal protection to the twin geological formations that rise above the horizon which are called ?Bears Ears? in English and nearly every local Native language. It also protects the more than 2 000 square miles of desert and shrub that surround them ?  a land of hidden canyons soaring peaks and starry silent nights. For the coalition of environmentalists and Native leaders who had long sought protection for the land it was a momentous victory. ?It actually brought tears to my face? said Eric Descheenie a former leader of the   group that had long lobbied for the monument. ?It?s so significant. It?s so hard to even try to add up what this really means. At the end of the day there?s only a certain place in this entire world on earth where we as indigenous peoples belong. ? Not everyone was as moved. Utah lawmakers had also long sought to protect most of the area but they had hoped to avoid the creation of a national monument. A national monument is much like a national park except that monuments are created unilaterally by the president under the authority of the    Antiquities Act. ?This arrogant act by a lame duck president will not stand? said Senator Mike Lee a Republican in a statement. ?I will work tirelessly with Congress and the incoming Trump administration to honor the will of the people of Utah and undo this designation. ? A     victory now poised to be undone by Trump and a   Congress ?  that description alone may characterize Obama?s sizable environmental record. But the Bears Ears site captures so much of what made the president?s legacy so inspiring to his supporters and so frustrating to his critics. First in protecting the land the president extended federal protection to a beautiful and biodiverse part of the country while also broadening the ?American story. ? Five sovereign Native nations ?  including the Navajo Hopi Zuni and Ute ?  had petitioned the president earlier this year to grant federal monument protections to the area. All five tribes attest that the area is dense with burial grounds and cultural sites. In the 19th century Navajo leaders used the area?s canyons to hide from the U. S. government?s campaign of forced relocation ?the long walk to Bosque Redondo. ? Outside archeologists know the area for its unmatched record of rock carvings which go back thousands of years before the common era. Rebecca Tsosie a law professor at the University of Arizona who is of Yaqui descent* said that one of the best aspects of the president?s proclamation was that it recognized Native people still use and need public lands today. ?The Antiquities Act was a statute that was very paternalistic toward Native people. It said that Native people are part of America?s past they?re part of America?s history? Tsosie told me. ?If you read the president?s proclamation it extends the act toward contemporary people. It?s a wonderful notion ?  it doesn?t freeze anything in the past. ? Second the move was classic Obama in its executive ambition. Bears Ears is the 29th time the president has invoked the 1906 Antiquities Act to expand or create a new national monument. Obama has used the law more than any other president and used it to protect far more acreage than any other president (though most of those acres are on the Pacific seafloor). And that ties into its third quintessential   quality: The move immediately kicked off partisan rage. This wasn?t unforeseeable. Locals lawmakers environmentalists and tribal representatives have argued over how to conserve and develop the Bears Ears area for years. Almost everyone agrees that most of the area should be protected. But they could not settle on how much how that should happen or what kind of protection the new park should receive. And many state Republicans wanted to see nearby acreage developed for commercial use or   extraction. Jason Chaffetz the Republican congressman whose district includes the new monument castigated the president on Wednesday for ?[politicizing] a   conflict. ? ?The midnight monument is a slap in the face to the people of Utah attempting to silence the voices of those who will bear the heavy burden it imposes? he said. He promised to try to undo the monument however he could. He was not alone in his opposition. Nearly every Utah Republican opposed a new federal monument on the site. In May Utah Governor Gary Herbert signed a resolution passed by the state legislature that specifically opposed the creation of a national monument. What irks Republicans so much now is that they feel like on this particular issue they weren?t asleep at the wheel. Chaffetz and Rob Bishop another House Republican from the state invested three years in a bill meant to protect the Bears Ears area. That bill the Utah Public Lands Initiative would have also opened up thousands of acres nearby to mining or development. It affected far more than the buttes though. Bishop described it as a kind of ?grand bargain? to decide the fate of 18 million acres in southern and eastern Utah. Under the bill huge expanses of wilderness in the state would have received lasting federal protection other expanses would be opened up to development and extraction ?  and in return the federal government would permanently lose the ability to set aside new national monuments in seven Utah counties. This was intentional. As Bishop told my colleague Michelle Cottle earlier this year he loathes the Antiquities Act and wishes to disarm it whenever possible. Talking to Western land managers last summer he called it ?the most evil act ever invented. ? ?If anyone here likes the Antiquities Act the way it is written die? he added. He feels it both disturbs the balance of powers delegating way too many powers to the president and is out of step with the times. It was enacted ?when there were [45] states and no environmental laws? he told Cottle. The only problem: Bishop and Chaffetz never found a winning coalition for their Public Lands Initiative bill. No Democrat in Congress supported it. Many environmental groups in Utah found it made too many cuts to the conservation area. And the five tribal nations with cultural claims to Bears Ears walked away from negotiations more than a year ago feeling unheard and unheeded. None of those conditions individually would have killed the bill. But crucially Chaffetz and Bishop who are both Congressional Republicans never seemed to get Congressional Republicans on board with the measure either. Over the summer the Public Lands Initiative bill sped through the House Natural Resources Committee which Bishop chairs. Then it stalled out. The House did not adopt it for a full vote during its September session. It did not raise it again during its   session after the election. And even if it made it through the House the bill never had a Senate version. And here lies the rub of Obama?s environmental legacy. Throughout the long three years that Bishop and Chaffetz?s bill was making it through the legislative process the Bears Ears site was getting looted. As word of the site?s archeological riches got out ?pot hunters? ?  that is people looking for Native artifacts to sell on the private market ?  began raiding its canyons and burial grounds for goods. In the spring and summer of 2016 there were six confirmed theft incidents from the Bears Ears area according to The Washington Post. This vandalism could be shocking in its disrespect. In one case someone erased an ancient carving from a rock face using an electric saw. In another someone dug up a   ceremonial chamber that had been previously left pristine.   The Antiquities Act was written in part to preserve cultural sites like these. In 1906 Congress delegated the power to create national monuments to Teddy Roosevelt?s White House because of the rise of ?pot hunting? ?  that is private raiders who were stealing artifacts (like pots) or disturbing burial grounds on federally owned land. These are the act?s eponymous antiquities: Native cultural objects that the law designated should really belong in ?reputable museums universities colleges or other recognized scientific or educational institutions. ? (You can see why   Native people like Tsosie find the law paternalistic.) Since its creation nearly every president including Democrats and Republicans has used the Antiquities Act to protect new sites of historical interest or natural splendor. The Grand Canyon was famously first protected under the Antiquities Act as were the Muir Woods the Petrified Forest and all of Utah?s ?Mighty Five? national parks. In that light President Obama has arguably acted in the spirit of the law by extending   protections to the Bears Ears area. He saw an urgent problem that Congress wasn?t fixing and used his statutory powers to make things right. In another light Obama saw a problem that Congress was fixing albeit slowly ?  and he didn?t like how it looked like it might end. So he used his final days in office to impose his will on a skeptical and resistant local population. Last month this is more or less the scene that Senator Mike Lee of Utah painted in The Washington Post. A new national monument ?would   an ongoing healthy debate further sow distrust in government among the American public and push us another step closer to an imperial presidency? he warned. Tsosie has a different view. ?Congress has been unable to act in certain ways in the recent months? she told me. ?I think it?s clear on many levels and not just this that there?s many many things that have just gotten bogged down there because of politics. [Bears Ears] was one of those issues that could have ended up in the political heap in the latter days of an administration. ? She was glad it didn?t. The fate of Bears Ears will depend largely on whether Utah Republicans can get the often sclerotic Senate to act. Under Article IV of the Constitution Congress has the sole ability to manage ?the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. ? It delegated some of those powers under the Antiquities Act but it could easily   them. For instance Congress could pass a law rescinding the Bears Ears National Monument in particular while establishing the Public Lands Initiative compromise. But Republicans might now be so irked that they try to repeal the Antiquities Act altogether. (The Heritage Foundation called for this last year.) At least under current rules either of these plans would require a   supermajority in the Senate. Opponents to Bears Ears would have fewer options in court or through executive action. The Supreme Court has broadly upheld the president?s powers to establish big new national monuments under the Antiquities Act. And President Trump will discover that the act itself works as a kind of   chute allowing him to set land aside for conservation but not to sweep it back in again. In other words presidents can unilaterally make national monuments but they can?t unilaterally unmake them. So there?s the president?s accomplishment: tremendous conservation amid tremendous controversy. Perhaps Obama has now permanently preserved an area of spectacular beauty and unparalleled cultural interest. Perhaps he has enabled Republicans to attack the legal architecture of federal conservation. Perhaps they would?ve done the latter anyway. Perhaps both will come true. For now it?s the monument?s supporters who are jubilant. Tsosie described a recent visit to the area with cultural experts from multiple nations. At certain places she said ?one tribal representative and another tribal representative would come together and tell their own tribe?s history of the place ?  and then find these new understandings of that history? in the sharing. ?That wouldn?t be possible but for that place and but for that history? she said. ?The Navajo the Zuni the Hopi the Ute they all have cultural sites and history there in that area ?  [the site] is the record of how Native people lived as peoples in places   with other people. ? In recognition of this Obama also established a tribal council to oversee and advise the federal government in maintaining the national monument. It?s an inspiring idea. If the monument survives and if the tribal council is able to   the area with consenting local governments and federal administrators then Bears Ears National Monument will be a jewel in the West ?  a historical treasure trove a biodiversity hotspot and a testament to the inclusive potential of American public life. 
414,73223,The CDC?s New Quarantine Rule Could Violate Civil Liberties,Atlantic,Ed Yong,12/30/2016,2016,12,,On August 15th with little fanfare the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took steps to improve its ability to deal with infectious outbreaks. The agency proposed a new rule that would expand its powers to screen test and quarantine people traveling into or within the United States in the event of a crisis like the historic Ebola outbreak of 2014. On the face of it this sounds like a good thing. The threat of infectious diseases is omnipresent and growing. Familiar threats like flu Ebola or measles continually rear their heads often in new guises while completely new dangers like MERS or SARS can take the world by surprise. When that happens the CDC must act quickly and decisively ?  and its new powers will purportedly help it to do so. But some epidemiologists lawyers and health organizations say that the rule in its current form poses a serious threat to civil liberties allowing authorities to detain and examine people with little heed to due process and informed consent.   ?They?re giving themselves the benefit of the doubt? says Jennifer Nuzzo an epidemiologist at the UPMC Center for Health Security and a   of a recent paper criticizing the proposed rule. ?I don?t worry about the CDC. I worry about people above them making them do things they don?t want to do because they?ve given themselves these broad powers. Those powers will make their jobs easier until they don?t. ? The CDC tried this play in 2005 proposing a rule that would have expanded their quarantine powers and required airlines to maintain a traveler database. But after a wave of critical comments including from the travel industry they shelved the rule. Its new incarnation is similar but perhaps even broader in scope. It covers ?  emergencies? which are defined as any ?communicable disease event? that the Director thinks could spread or ?is highly likely to cause death or serious illness if not properly controlled. ? (The Director can be changed by the President at any time without Senate confirmation.) During such events the CDC could screen people at airports and other transport hubs apprehend those they suspect of being ill for three days and potentially quarantine or isolate them pending a medical review. It is already authorized to detain people suspected of carrying diseases like plague Ebola and (somewhat improbably) smallpox. But the new rule does away with a formal list. It extends the same powers to any ?quarantinable communicable disease? and uses wider range of symptoms (from a list that federal agents can update as the need arises) for defining ?ill? people. There are good reasons behind these semantic expansions. The current system was enshrined in 1944 and needs an update in the face of the diseases that have arisen since. For example the existing list of warning symptoms doesn?t cover many important signs of known diseases like Ebola and MERS. Meanwhile new and unknown illnesses are emerging all the time. ?The CDC trying to equip itself with sufficient flexibility to respond to diseases we?ve never heard of in a way where it doesn?t have to revisit these rules every few years? says James Hodge Jr a professor of   law and ethics at Arizona State University. ?I?m supportive of that. ? But Hodge Nuzzo and others feel that the CDC risks sacrificing personal liberty at the altar of flexibility and expediency. ?The rule allows the CDC to move on somebody based on some belief that they might pose some amorphous risk to others? says Hodge. ?That?s not a standard that survives constitutional scrutiny. ? For a start the rule is sparse when it comes to due process. It allows the CDC to detain travelers indefinitely before deciding whether to quarantine them saying only that the agency ?doesn?t expect? such apprehensions to last for more than 72 hours. It doesn?t make provisions for legal counsel if people can?t afford a lawyer themselves. And it puts any reviews of the agency?s decisions under the auspices of its own employees rather than a neutral third party. Using the rule ?a future administration could hold travelers in government custody for days or weeks without providing an explanation or an opportunity for the individuals to challenge their detentions? write Emma Roth and Kyle Edwards from Yale Law School. The rule also gives the CDC ultimate authority to carry out medical tests and treatments stating that ?the individual?s consent shall not be considered as a prerequisite to the exercise of any authority. ? That?s medically unethical says Hodge since informed consent has been a bedrock of medicine for decades. ?If you don?t get it you could have additional quarantine but you don?t get to force informed consent on people. ? Perhaps the most striking thing about these criticisms is how easy it would be for the CDC to have its cake and eat it. ?There are really basic due process steps that could be put in place that would not undermine the CDC?s powers but that would put in checks and balances so that when the powers are exercised it?s done in a way that respects civil liberties? says Alexandra Phelan from Georgetown Law School.   The stickier problem is that there?s little evidence to support screening or quarantining travelers. Consider the Ebola outbreak. The CDC screened more than 38 000 travelers flying into the U. S. by interviewing them and checking their medical records. They then monitored over 10 000 people for 21 days. And they caught exactly zero cases of Ebola. You might ask: So what? Why take the chance? Why not ensure that we?ll catch the rare exceptions in the future? Here?s the thing and it bears emphasizing: What you think would work in an outbreak often does not work. In these situations   ?common sense? can completely backfire. ?With Ebola? says Nuzzo screening doesn?t work because ?you?re not transmissible until you?re really sick and then you?re not moving. ? It?s telling that Thomas Duncan a Liberian man who was diagnosed with Ebola while visiting family in Dallas didn?t spread the virus to anyone in his family or his community. He only transmitted it to two nurses who were caring for him long after it was obvious that he had Ebola. Quarantines could also have serious unintended consequences. ?You create the expectation that you can keep cases out by monitoring them and there?s no evidence that we can do this? says Nuzzo. If the disease does enter the country that would seriously damage the credibility of health workers ?  the CDC included. When doctor Richard Spencer fell sick with Ebola in New York after having helped with the outbreak in Guinea he was vilified. People went on a witch hunt to find all the places he?d been to or eaten at even though there was no risk of him spreading the virus at any of those places. ?If we start monitoring people it enforces that message. ? The distrust and confusion will be exacerbated if people fear that they will be quarantined unfairly cases will go underground and diseases will spread. And if health workers share those fears they?ll be unwilling to travel to outbreak zones to help. That happened in the last Ebola outbreak: thanks to the CDC?s quarantines the number of American health workers traveling to West Africa fell by 25 percent. Many worried that they would lose their jobs if they were isolated for weeks upon their return. Quarantine also creates severe stigma. In 2014 two   workers and a family of six Liberian immigrants were quarantined in Connecticut. ?Though none had been exposed to Ebola or posed any threat to public health the state confined these individuals to their homes for weeks? write Roth and Edwards who represented them. ?The state failed to provide these individuals with food or other basic necessities and failed to inform some that they had the legal right to challenge their quarantine orders in court. To this day Liberian Americans in Connecticut experience shame and stigma as a result of wrongly being labeled a threat to public health. ? By contrast other states used far less restrictive measures like daily phone calls with health workers. That proved to be just as effective. Rather than immediately shooting for quarantines the CDC could amend their rule to use such options where possible.   How the CDC will react to these criticisms is unclear. They left the rule online for a   period of public comment that ended on October 14. ?Important people in this field did not know about this until the comment period had closed? Nuzzo says. ?If I was the CDC and wanted to put these regulations through and make them as good as possible I wouldn?t publish an   document and hope whoever needs to know sees it in 2 months. ? Still the agency received 15 794 comments. The vast majority of these were   and incoherent says Hodge who reviewed them all. Around 500 to 600 were meaningful and came from health agencies like Doctors Without Borders legal scholars the airline industry and more. The CDC has to respond to these and then issue a final rule which must be approved by senior members of the Department of Health and Human Services and potentially by the President. In a statement Kathy Harben from the CDC?s Division of Public Affairs said: ?During this active   period we are unable to discuss the proposed rule or disclose how CDC will respond to the public comments. CDC will carefully review and consider each comment before publication of a final rule. ? But Hodge says ?We were given some inside information that they?re trying to push this through prior to the change in administration. ? That?s not comforting given   Donald Trump?s documented responses to outbreaks of the past. During the Ebola outbreak as I noted in a recent article he: promoted false information about the disease repeatedly called for the U. S. to stop all flights from   countries and said that American health workers who became infected should be stopped from   the country and ?must suffer the consequences. ? These statements provide little reassurance that he will respect scientific evidence or civil liberties during a future crisis. The CDC came out against travel bans at the time but their new regulation ?  though   ?  might pave the way for similarly Draconian measures. ?Its regulations inadvertently create a space for decisions that are not   and might violate constitutional liberties and principles of health ethics? says Phelan. ?It?s a space where ideology can play out. ?
415,73224,Will the Alabama Crimson Tide Keep Rolling?,Atlantic,Robert O'Connell,12/30/2016,2016,12,,Minutes into an   game against Texas AM the University of Alabama defensive end Jonathan Allen danced around his blocker and set his sights on the quarterback Trevor Knight. A running back stepped up to try to slow Allen. It was a common enough sequence but what came next was a rarer sight. The back crouched to deliver a blow and Allen ?  a 6?3?   native Alabaman ?  simply leaped went horizontal and in one motion cleared the block and brought Knight to the ground. It was like watching an armored truck sprout wings and lift off the road. By the time the play reached YouTube someone had set it to the Superman score. On December 31 Alabama will play the University of Washington Huskies in the semifinal of the College Football Playoff. The Crimson Tide college football?s lone remaining undefeated team and a   betting favorite has held the top spot in the Associated Press poll every week of the season. Allen?s airborne sack is just a pebble in the mountain of highlights the team has produced this year but it?s also an apt summary. The Tide is bigger faster stronger and better than every opponent at nearly every position. Other teams can do everything correctly and nevertheless be overwhelmed. Go to the right spot and the Tide will still roll over you. The Price of   Concussions The story of college football over the last decade has been variations on the theme of Alabama triumph. Last year?s championship victory over Clemson University gave the head coach Nick Saban four titles in his nine years in Tuscaloosa. Under Saban Alabama uses a conservative but highly effective approach predicated on running the ball and playing stout defense. That style coupled with the results it?s brought about has not always endeared the team to casual football fans many of whom participate in an   ritual of rooting for a postseason Alabama loss. Those fans will almost certainly be disappointed this New Year?s Eve but they?ll just as surely be watching because the Crimson Tide has given college football something every sport can use: a dominant force and entrenched favorite a presence that makes each season historic in one way or another. Saban has termed this    strategy wherein repetition breeds excellence ?The Process. ? A short pinched man who paces the sideline and whose smoothed hair turns into a sort of indignant halo when he yanks off his headset in a rage Saban speaks of consistency the way clergymen speak of saints. ?It?s about committing yourself to being the best you can be on that particular day? is one in a ream of similar quotes. ?Improvement is a steady march and you have to be committed to it. ? Coupled with Saban?s gift for recruiting ?  Alabama?s   freshmen usually spend a year or two sitting behind its   juniors and seniors ?  The Process leads to teams that both astonish with the caliber of their play and make for   upset targets. The most memorable college football games of recent vintage all feature the Tide. In last year?s championship the Alabama system withstood a furious effort from Watson watching the game was like seeing a building shudder but remain standing through an earthquake. The year before in the national semifinal a   Ohio State team beat   Alabama behind   quarterback Cardale Jones. It was this game not the actual   against Oregon a week later that secured Jones?s   status. Perhaps most famously the 2013 Iron Bowl ?  the annual rivalry game between Alabama and the   Auburn Tigers ?  ended when Auburn cornerback Chris Davis returned a missed Alabama field goal 100 yards for a   touchdown. The shock and strangeness of the play made it extraordinary but the fact that it came against dynastic Alabama ?  number one at that moment too ?  made it unforgettable. This is the   gift that some teams can give their sports. A juggernaut of a certain caliber not only thrills its own fans but raises the stakes of entire seasons. When LeBron James joined the Miami Heat in 2010 the whole NBA took on a new urgency. When the New York Yankees rattled off four World Series victories in five years at the tail end of the 1990s they won the disdain and viewership of a generation of fans that hadn?t been around to hate them two decades prior. During the heyday of Tiger Woods golf reached a larger audience than ever with a narrative previously unimaginable. From time to time teams and players come along who are good enough to make every game a story. Such is the case with Alabama. If Saturday?s game goes as expected it will be a football master class. Hurts will veer out of the way of Washington rushers and loose   darts and the Tide defense will handcuff an overmatched Huskies offense. Saban will stand with his arms crossed and his brow furrowed ?  a posture that for him passes as a celebration. But if Saturday?s game ends up differently it will be a miracle. The Washington quarterback Jake Browning a   artist whose hopeful heaves contrast nicely with Alabama?s rigidity would join Ohio State?s Jones as a college football tall tale and the coach Chris Petersen as optimistic as Saban is strict would earn himself heroic status and likely a hefty raise. Despite the grumbling that will ensue if the Crimson Tide wins it is for unaffiliated fans a   proposition. The likely outcome is a demonstration of pure athletic excellence an astonishing run continued the unlikely one would be one of the year?s best sports stories. January 9?s title game should the Tide reach it would have similar resonance. When a team as good as Alabama takes the field there is no room for the underwhelming ?  only degrees of the incredible.
416,73225,Embracing an Ordinary Economy,Atlantic,Alexia Fernndez Campbell,12/30/2016,2016,12,,In the past half century many politicians have promised to return the country to the golden years following World War II: an era of continuous strong economic growth. During that period American incomes rose sharply which allowed more families than ever to buy homes and cars and fulfill what many touted as the American dream. But those high growth rates ?  which were around 5 percent ?  were an exception not the norm according to the economist and historian Marc Levinson. The world will likely never see prosperity expand at that rate again. It may seem like a bleak prediction but Levinson argues that promising otherwise is misleading. As my colleagues Alana Semuels and Derek Thompson have noted it might not even be necessary for the economy to grow as much as some politicians have suggested ?  and in any event most politicians (including presidents) can do very little to revive the economy. In Levinson?s new book An Extraordinary Time: The End of the Postwar Boom and the Return of the Ordinary Economy he provides historical context to explain why Americans ?  and people across the globe ?  should expect slower economic growth in the years to come. Levinson spoke with me about why everyone should embrace the ?ordinary? economy and the role that the federal government plays in shaping it. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity. Alexia Fernandez Campbell: In the book you argue that productivity growth not economic policies is what really makes the economy grow. Can you explain that? Marc Levinson: Productivity growth is really what fuels economic growth. And economic policy has a very limited effect on productivity growth. That?s not to say the government can?t do anything but the major causes of productivity growth are innovations that happen in the private sector. That means inventions that means new ways of doing business new ideas which end up affecting the economy in unpredictable times and in unpredictable ways. And the government just has very limited ability to orchestrate that. Campbell: Wouldn?t you say this is an era of   innovation? Levinson: Well innovation is not the same thing as productivity growth. I?ve written about the history of container shipping. The shipping container was developed in the 1950s but it didn?t really start to have a big effect on productivity until the 1980s. Why? Because businesses needed to figure out how to take advantage of it. You don?t just close down your existing businesses and do everything differently. It took several decades before businesses began to reshape their supply chains and develop what we now call globalization because of this change in transportation costs. We spent a lot of money much of it government money in the 1940s and 1950s developing computer technology and developing some of the precursors to the internet. That showed up in productivity growth in the 1990s when there was three or four years of productivity that was not as good as in the ?50s and ?60s but much better than we?d had in the ?70s and ?80s. And so there were government expenditures on technology and they paid off 30 or 40 years later. And some of the spending on innovation will probably have no impact on productivity. Campbell: You also argue that while the world experienced its biggest economic boom in the 30 years following World War II that growth likely won?t be repeated. Why not? Levinson: There was a period of extremely rapid productivity growth in the   period. Before in all of the wealthy countries millions of people were working farm fields by hand. They were working fields behind horses and mules. Then these people started moving to factories and instantly became much more productive just by working in front of a machine instead of walking behind a horse. There were low education levels at the start of that period and most people didn?t go to high school. By very rapidly increasing education levels around the world during the ?50s and ?60s there was this huge growth in productivity. The roads were generally narrow and quite congested in the period after World War II. We were able to build expressways and dramatically improve speed as well as safety. That meant that businesses could do their work much more efficiently could sell to larger markets. It meant that workers could take jobs that were further from home. So all of those were great advances but they were   advances and you can?t repeat that story. If you build another exit on the freeway that doesn?t do the same thing for productivity as building the freeway in the first place. So this is not to say that government spending on infrastructure or education or research is a bad thing. I think it?s a fine thing. But it?s going to have a much more modest economic impact than the spending that it did on these things in the 1950s and 1960s. Campbell: Can you briefly talk about how Americans? lives changed during this Golden Age? Levinson: During the   period rapid economic growth brought very rapid income growth. And that played out in higher standards of living. It?s pretty hard now to go back and recall the conditions that people lived in. Most farm families at the end of World War II didn?t have electricity. A lot of people who lived in the cities didn?t have complete plumbing in their houses. People were able to buy cars because their incomes rose so quickly. They were able to go to college to take vacations. Their living standards really rose remarkably. And this was true in all the wealthy economies not just the United States. Campbell: Why is adjusting interest rates taxes and spending not enough? Is there anything policymakers and politicians can do to really make a difference? Levinson: In the short term there?s a lot that the government can do. If there?s suddenly a big surge in government spending it?s going to bring the unemployment rate down for a little while. But government?s ability to do that sort of thing for very long is quite limited. You can?t really use those kinds of tools to raise your     rate.   growth really depends on productivity growth and a government?s ability to affect productivity growth is at the margin. Yes an improved education system leads to more qualified workers and that will improve productivity growth. That?s a great thing but we?re talking about a fraction of a percent here not the very large gains in productivity seen  in the ?50s and ?60s and early ?70s. So I?m not going to tell you that government is powerless here. I?m going to tell you that government is much less powerful than people like to think. Campbell: Why do you think so many Americans ?  when it comes to elections ?  put so much hope in the idea that politicians are going to revive the economy? Levinson: This is not just in the United States. If you look around the world you?ve seen this trend globally before and again now. In the   period most of the governments around the world were of a   sort what we would call liberal in the United States. And they believed in a major role for government the government had a very substantial part of the economy. Many of these countries engaged in intense economic planning figuring that they could permanently stabilize the economy and put an end to unemployment. And that worked fine up to 1973 or it seemed to. Then when economic growth slowed around the world voters blamed these governments for their inability to get things back to where they had been. And so in one country after another you saw voters turn to more conservative politicians who were promising different approaches to restart economic growth. This was the era of Margaret Thatcher and this was the era of Ronald Reagan and Helmut Kohl and Yasuhiro Nakasone in Japan. And the sales pitch was that these people were going to use   mechanisms to produce higher productivity growth. Well that didn?t work either. People forget that now but productivity growth under Margaret Thatcher in the U. K. was no higher than it had been before she came into office. The same was true during Reagan?s time as president of the United States. So voters look for change when they don?t think the government is delivering the goods. And I think we?re seeing that now. In many countries in the world voters are expressing their dislike their distrust of their government. They want to try something different and they?re hoping that somehow what they?re trying is going to bring them better economic conditions. I?m afraid that they?re likely to be disappointed because I think governments have very little ability to deliver these things. Governments can affect the distribution of income. And we?re having an interesting discussion about that in the United States. But I think governments have much less effect on the rate of economic growth. Does the Economy Really Need to Keep Growing Quite So Much? Campbell: Can you talk more about how governments can affect the distribution of income? Levinson: If you consider an economy that?s growing at 5 percent a year ?  which was the norm in the rich world between 1948 and 1973 ?  if one person is seeing his income grow faster than that somebody else might be seeing his income grow slower. But still they?re both coming out pretty well. If we?re looking at economic growth of 1. 5 percent it?s a different story. If one person is experiencing good income growth then somebody else may be experiencing none at all. So income distribution becomes a much more contentious issue. And now there?s slower economic growth in all of the wealthy economies and in many of the developing countries so you?ve got people fighting over a pie that?s not growing very quickly. Campbell: How does the government play a role in that? Levinson: The government can use a variety of policies to fix that. The government can adjust the tax system to even out the distribution of income. The government can use spending programs to channel more income to certain people. There are many policy options for evening out the distribution of income. Although I?ve got to say the evidence is that the worsening distribution of income is not just a U. S. problem. You see this in many other countries too. It?s probably more extreme in the United States but if you look at Japan or Germany or Spain you see a large number of people who are just on the edge of the economy. They?re not doing very well. And their incomes are not growing compared to everybody else. And so this is really a global trend and it?s been difficult for countries to combat it. Campbell: It sounds like you?re saying that people should lower their expectations. Is that true? Levinson: I think they need to set the bar lower in terms of what to expect of our governments by way of economic growth. Expectations are based on an experience from a particular period of time and it?s going to be extremely difficult to repeat that. That doesn?t mean that the government can?t provide a more even distribution of income. So if people want to advocate changes in the tax system or if people want to advocate better social benefits for this group or that group perhaps it will be possible to achieve that without hurting economic growth. But those things aren?t going to change the fact that the economic pie overall is expanding at a pretty slow rate and governments really can?t do much to speed up that rate.
417,73226,2016: A Year Defined by America?s Diverging Economies,Atlantic,Annie Lowrey,12/30/2016,2016,12,,In many ways 2016 has been the strongest year economically since the   or even the late 1990s. Unemployment was low. Wages were increasing. The markets hit new highs. Consumer confidence rose. Yet Donald Trump unseated the incumbent party and won the presidential election promoting economic pessimism and promising restoration: He swore to Make America Great Again describing the country as falling behind workers as jilted growth as anemic and the current period of expansion as a sham. How could a message like Trump?s take hold in an economy like that? The answer is that it did not take hold with everyone ?  or more to the point everywhere. In ways that have been overlooked and   for years the strength of the   recovery has varied dramatically not just from income bracket to income bracket but from place to place as well. And it so happens that the places left behind are also places that wield outsized political power ?  enough power to vault the loser of the popular vote to the presidency and to make the economic story of 2016 more about stagnation failure and the dissolution of the American dream than it was about the headline economic numbers. And those headline numbers were undeniably good. This year offered unremarkable but steady growth ?  about 2 percent the     annual pace that has characterized the Obama recovery. But over time that     annual pace has nudged the economy to a pretty good position relative to where it was eight years ago. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4. 6 percent its lowest level in nine years and ?in the vicinity of maximum employment? according to Janet Yellen the chair of the Federal Reserve. Businesses added about 2 million jobs and measures of underemployment dropped as well. ?It?s a pretty good year bordering on a very good year in terms of jobs? Mark Zandi the chief economist at Moody?s Analytics told me. Competition for workers led businesses to boost wages with earnings jumping faster this fall than at any other point during the recovery. ?The job market was pretty solid for   workers? said Zandi. ?  hikes helped and you saw a lot of retailers and   restaurants get ahead of those increases too. ? Indeed economic growth started to reach down to   and even poor families towards the end of the Obama administration. According to Census data median household income jumped 5. 2 percent between 2014 and 2015 the first increase since 2007 (though it is still lower than it was in 1999 adjusting for inflation). Millions of people were lifted above the poverty line with the drop in the poverty rate the biggest in a half century. Those trends are expected to continue next year. 2016 proved encouraging in financial markets as well. The total net worth of American households surged past $90 trillion driven by a powerful buildup in the value of houses and stocks. At the national level the housing market rose to new heights though home prices remained below their   peak after accounting for inflation. The stock market climbed to heady new territory as well. But those aggregate   numbers deceive as much as they elucidate. Income inequality became a dominant theme in the 2012 presidential election given its power in explaining why steady growth and a booming stock market were leaving so many behind. Now other sorts of disparities have taken on new importance. ?In the recent past the focus on inequality has all been about where you fall in the distribution whether in the 10 percent 1 percent or top tenth of a percent? said Jed Kolko the chief economist at the   website Indeed. ?Now that discussion is shifting to differences between groups with those groups being geographic and also different in terms of the types of jobs available and education levels. ? It is these geographic inequalities that help to explain why the recovery left so many voters enraged and the peculiar structure of the American electoral system explains why that rage proved so politically potent. The recovery has been characterized by yawning gaps between the rich the middle and the poor. But as Trump?s election made clear it has also been characterized by yawning gaps between cities the suburbs and rural parts of the country. ?Once you go beneath those big national largely encouraging statistics you see a lot of variation? said Mark Muro a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ?This is about   cosmopolitan metropolitan areas pitted against   rural counties and some small metros. It is absolutely clear that the economic story has been much more difficult in that second group of    counties. ? Indeed the employment rate in rural areas was actually 2. 9 percent lower in   than it was in early 2007 just before the Great Recession started: There has been no jobs recovery in those   swaths of the country. The employment rate in metropolitan areas in contrast is 4. 8 percent higher than its 2007 level and businesses are adding jobs twice as fast in urban areas as they are in rural ones. The   counties that boomed during the Clinton expansion started to lag during the Bush expansion and really fell behind during the Obama expansion. ?The urban counties of large metros actually did better in the recession and recovery than they did? during the   years of the 2000s Kolko said. And some metros are doing far better than others with New York and the Bay Area in particular booming minting millionaires and launching new businesses. (One stark data point: Wages are so high in San Jose San Francisco and New York that some economists think building more housing to let more people move there would boost national economic output by an astounding 10 percent.) The story is not just about New York beating rural Illinois but New York beating St. Louis. Government policies that had made the country more equal across regions ?  among them antitrust protections ?  were forgotten or rolled back in the late 20th century. And fortunes diverged. According to a report from the Economic Innovation Group an   research and advocacy organization the economy is growing more and more reliant on a smaller and smaller number of ? ? counties some of them in or near Los Angeles Miami and New York City. Just 20 counties out of more than 3 000 nationwide accounted for half of the net increase in new businesses between 2010 and 2014. The number of counties seeing net job growth has dwindled too. All in all this adds up to in the report?s words ?a massive and historically unprecedented imbalance? in geographic dynamism. The kinds of jobs in places like Dallas and Las Vegas and San Francisco versus eastern Kentucky or   Texas or the   Dakota border might explain why the recovery feels more durable in denser areas too. Workers in rural areas are far more likely to be involved in industries like farming forestry mining and manufacturing sectors in which job growth has been undercut and remains threatened by offshoring and automation. ?These are thin economies.   ?     Other than the hospital or local government there isn?t a whole lot going on? Zandi said. It?s just stagnation. ? Workers in urban areas on the other hand are more likely to be involved in knowledge or service jobs like corporate law or home health work that are harder to offshore or pass off to a robot ?  which is true even for many jobs that are not particularly  . Rural areas are lagging their urban counterparts in terms of home values ?  the single biggest component of most households? net worth ?  too. The rise in home values has been sharpest of late in coastal cities like Seattle and Boston. And the market for downtown luxury condos has recovered in a way that the market for exurban ranch homes has not with the spoils concentrated on the high end. Data compiled by the   firm Weiss Analytics and reported by The Wall Street Journal shows that home prices in ZIP codes where the average house is worth $500 000 to $1 million are up 39 percent since the crash in places where houses are generally worth $100 000 to $150 000 home prices are up just 16 percent. The   appreciation rate for houses in those cheaper generally more rural ZIP codes is a quarter what it is for houses in those posher generally more urban and coastal ZIP codes. As rural areas have stagnated and urban areas have become more vibrant (as well as more unequal) optimism itself has become more unevenly distributed during the recovery. According to Gallup data people living in big cities urban suburbs and college towns were the most sanguine about the overall economic outlook as of 2015 and they had grown much more positive since 2009 ?  right when the recovery started to take off for them. People living in (in Gallup?s words) ?evangelical hubs? the ?  country? ?aging farmlands? and ?rural middle America? on the other hand were dour about the economy?s prospects as of 2015 and had become only somewhat more optimistic since the darkest days of the crisis. Race and ethnicity play into the geography of the recovery too: Black and Hispanic families are more likely to live in urban areas than white families and their representation in the workforce has grown through the recovery. As of 2015 there were 66 million white   workers with   jobs down from 72 million in 2007. In contrast according to Department of Labor data the number of black   workers with   jobs remained roughly the same for Hispanic and Latino workers it grew to 15 million from 13. 6 million. More than half of the job gains since late 2007 have gone to Hispanics who make up 14 percent of the labor force 29 percent of the job gains went to Asians who make up 5 percent of the labor force and 25 percent of the job gains went to blacks who make up 11 percent of the labor force according to an analysis from the Economic Cycle Research Institute a nonpartisan think tank. Demographic changes ?  specifically the workforce becoming less white ?  explain much of the shift. But ?part of the reason may be that these jobs predominantly in [the service sector] were created in metropolitan areas rather than in rural areas and small towns where factories were shuttered and the manufacturing jobs disappeared? the report concluded. This hardly means that black and Hispanic workers have come out ahead of white workers in the recovery. By all accounts white Americans continue to enjoy far better economic conditions than do Americans of color. The unemployment rate for   white workers is just 3. 7 percent. For black workers it is 7. 8 percent and for Hispanic or Latino workers 5. 3 percent. Moreover the racial wealth gap sits at its worst level in a generation and as Valerie Wilson of the   Economic Policy Institute wrote the ?rise in overall wage inequality [has] mechanically separated black and white workers? wages? over the past 35 years since black workers were more likely to be working   jobs to begin with. Finally variance in education levels has overlapped with place and race to create divergent experiences of the recovery. People in rural areas are less likely to have a college degree and the growth in the share of people completing college has been slower in rural areas too. But job gains during the recovery have been strongest among workers with more education with the economy adding 8. 4 million jobs for people with bachelor?s degrees. Those jobs are clustered in big metro areas not in rural ones. Taking these disparities into account then the state of the economy meshes well enough with the outcome of the election. On the whole Trump voters were as likely to be employed as those who voted for Hillary Clinton. They had on average higher incomes. Many lived in places with an unemployment rate down in the neighborhood of 3 percent. Yet the trajectory of their communities felt far worse. Trump had extremely deep support in rural places that felt more stagnant where the opportunities were dimmer and where output and productivity were lower. To wit: Clinton?s counties account for   of the nation?s economic output and Trump?s just a third. For many voters that sense of stagnation and being left behind mixed with the potent forces of racial animus sexism cultural disdain and political polarization. Indeed economic hardship alone may not explain Trump?s victory so much as a desire in some regions for a more general political  . Still in the end place race and class became far more important to understanding how the economy influenced voter behavior than anything that was happening to GDP or median household income. And there are signs that that will continue to be true going forward. Democrats are sorting into       areas that are more racially diverse ?  and hold less weight in the Electoral College. Republicans are sorting into       areas that are whiter ?  and hold more weight. What can be done to revitalize those counties that feel left behind that the recovery in many ways has bypassed? That is the hard part. Policy is much better at redistributing money to individuals than it is at revitalizing regions. The federal government has every lever it needs to address income inequality and very few to address the problems of living in an economy reliant on wheat prices coal mines or the operation of factories. ?We have a well   sense of   economies? said Muro of the Brookings Institution referring to economists? understanding of cities. ?Where we don?t have many ideas at all is in terms of economies that don?t have critical mass. One of the few ideas we have seems to be to invite people to move [to them]. ? Economists do have a few other ideas. Infrastructure investment in struggling parts of the country ?  building rural prisons say or constructing a beautiful wall through a sparsely populated desert ?  would help though such implementation can take time. Policies to help certain industries through tariffs or tax incentives or government stimulus ?  punishing foreign automakers perhaps or subsidizing American steel companies ?  might even things out as well and Trump has shown a remarkable willingness to meddle in companies? internal affairs and boost certain businesses over others. But the truth is that the forces holding rural America back and pushing urban America forward are profound ones. Just as income inequality has become a fixture in many Americans? understanding of the economy so too must geographic inequality. And not just in election years. 
418,73227,The Year in Religion and Politics,Atlantic,Candice Norwood,12/30/2016,2016,12,,Every December The Atlantic looks back on the previous year ?  to highlight not just the ?big moments? but also the progression of ?big ideas. ? Below the third of three installments looks at the year in religion coverage. A contentious presidential race that reshuffled political coalitions put religion in the national spotlight in 2016. Many religious voters feeling ostracized in a changing national landscape chose to support Donald Trump ?  a candidate who hardly seemed to exemplify Christian morality but who nevertheless promised to ?make America great again. ? Those who could not connect with Trump?s controversial rhetoric instead challenged his candidacy dividing religious communities. Over the course of the year Atlantic writers also delved into other prominent issues ?  from the battle over religious freedom to the country?s growing Islamophobia. The Freedom to Choose: Religious liberty came to the fore of the national conversation after the Supreme Court?s landmark 2014 decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. In 2016 it produced a push for legislation that would give businesses public bathrooms and religious colleges the right to limit services to LGBT people. Emma Green followed these bills closely throughout the year. She covered the challenges state legislatures face working to protect LGBT   while also upholding religious freedom. In another story she examined what the death of U. S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will mean for the future of   decisions. Jonathan Merritt also weighed in writing that the problems these laws claim to address don?t actually exist. Alan Noble offered a plea for accommodation between activists and religious colleges and Alan Levinovitz argued that trigger warnings served to make campuses hostile to religious students. Living in Fear: Donald Trump?s presidential campaign and policy platforms sparked questions over how Muslims should be treated in the United States. Research suggests that his divisive rhetoric ?  from calling for a ban on Muslim entry into the country to strategizing plans for a nationwide registry ?  may fuel Islamophobia and hate crimes wrote Clare Foran. And Nafisa Eltahir looked at the bind facing religious Muslims who can downplay their religious identity to avoid discrimination but may find that approach ?can only bring exhaustion along with the loss of distinctive elements of Muslim culture. ? A Community Divided: Donald Trump proved to be a controversial figure within evangelical communities as well. Molly Ball highlighted the split among evangelical leaders after Trump gave a speech at Liberty University in January Emma Green returned to the campus in October to find students fatigued with politics and the Republican Party that gave them Trump. Jonathan Merritt examined the shift away from looking to politicians for moral leadership and Yoni Appelbaum argued that in Trump evangelicals had found a champion not a moral exemplar. Christianity in the Contemporary United States: White evangelicals began the year feeling besieged and ended it in triumph. Emma Green reported on a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute and Brookings that found almost half of Americans believe Christian discrimination is as much of a problem as discrimination against minorities. She also explored the historical context of Trump?s appeal to evangelicals. Robert P. Jones delved deeper into these feelings of displacement and asked ?why white Protestantism as a whole ?  arguably the most powerful cultural force in the history of the United States ?  has faded. ? And in the wake of Trump?s election Green found white evangelicals newly hopeful. The Politics of Abortion: The tension between maintaining religious freedom and protecting women?s health continued to play out in American politics this year. Stephanie   argued that U. S. courts tend to favor conservative Christian viewpoints when ruling on these cases. Garrett Epps shared how this might play out in a Supreme Court case involving a group of religious nonprofits that do not want to provide contraception coverage for their employees. The 2016 candidates also weighed in on the debate. Hillary Clinton has been a   advocate but the University of Chicago professor Myriam Renaud argued that ?her Methodist upbringing has shaped her ambivalence about the procedure. ? Donald Trump promised to appoint a Supreme Court justice who would overturn Roe v. Wade ?automatically. ? But many including Peter Beinart questioned how Trump really feels about abortion.
419,73228,Will Law Enforcement Support Trump?s Immigration Plans?,Atlantic,Priscilla Alvarez,12/30/2016,2016,12,,In an interview with 60 Minutes last month   Donald Trump made yet another pledge to remove undocumented immigrants from the United States saying he would deport up to 3 million of them who ?have criminal records. ? Similar promises ?  like building a wall along the U. S.  border and blocking federal funding to   sanctuary cities ?  were a cornerstone of his campaign. But as he assumes the presidency Trump will face not only continued public opposition to his plans but potential obstruction by state and local law enforcement who he would need to implement any new policies. In many cases federal immigration agents rely on local and state police forces to identify individuals who are in violation of immigration laws and if so to turn them over to the Department of Homeland Security?s   arm. Rick Su a law professor at the University at Buffalo who has researched immigration and local government explains the significance of the cooperation this way: ?The fact of the matter is local law enforcement in this country encompasses the vast majority of   resources. ? He added: ?As much as we talk about federal policy and the growth of the federal government their capabilities are quite limited given how large the country is. ? Obama: Reaching Out to Adversaries Alienating Allies But the collaboration between different levels of law enforcement has hit roadblocks in the past. Take the Secure Communities program which originated in the George W. Bush administration. Under the program local authorities shared digital fingerprints of people booked in jail with the feds who could then screen a national database to see if any matched with individuals suspected of immigration violations. Over time however the program appeared to drive a wedge between local authorities and the communities they served. The Obama administration ended it in 2014 citing backlash from governors mayors and state and local enforcement officials. When it comes to his promised immigration policies the   has already faced backlash of his own. From the public but also from mayors and governors ?  like Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy ?  who?ve pledged to limit cooperation with federal immigration agents during the Trump presidency. I spoke with Su to get a sense of how state and local governments might process the  ?s proposals. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Priscilla Alvarez: Donald Trump has pledged to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. What does this proposal mean for state and local governments? Rick Su: I think it has tremendous implications only because interior enforcement of immigration in recent years has been extremely dependent on state and local participation.   ?     If we are going to be talking about the kind of numbers that President Trump is interested in he will need in some ways some degree of participation ?  unless he wants to greatly expand federal enforcement agencies. He would need state and local participation in order to accentuate the numbers that he wants. But because of their involvement states and localities have also been developing their own interests and policies on immigration. Alvarez: What?s an example of the effect that federal immigration policies have on state and local law enforcement? Su: The collapse of Secure Communities would be a good way of looking at it. And this wasn?t dramatic involvement [of   and federal law enforcement] these weren?t like the Bush administration raids [some of which controversially took place at people?s workplaces]. These were supposed to be    in the booking process and the detention process.   ?     At first I think it was considered to be very innocuous very   . I think what ended up happening is as you had more and more accounts that during any encounter with police departments ?  whether as a victim as a witness or maybe as a perpetrator or a suspect ?  they would screen you automatically for immigration status you started having a lot of local police departments local police chiefs express concerns that that was making it more difficult for them to reach out to the communities that they want to help and protect. Just as federal immigration enforcement now is reliant on local police departments local police departments have also realized that they are also incredibly reliant on the communities themselves that help them with policing efforts. If you don?t have the cooperation of the community that itself becomes a problem. You can?t entirely do it from a   enforcement perspective. I think that?s when you started seeing a lot of people ?  and a lot of communities ?  rebel against the development of Secure Communities. And eventually President Obama scrapped it even though it was originally imagined as something that was much less visible and much less intrusive than what previous administrations had done. But as a result it made local communities much more attuned to the kind of relationships they have with the federal government. Alvarez: There have been a number of mayors and governors who have voiced their opposition to Trump?s immigration proposals. Is that an example of the type of resistance Trump may face? Su: The urgency has been raised because of what Donald Trump is proposing and because I think local law enforcement knows what would be involved if he actually wanted to carry out the numbers.   ?     These are policies and positions [opposing some federal immigration measures] that mayors have actually been taking already with less visibility for a long time. So in some ways they?re reasserting or reaffirming their position in light of different circumstances and maybe with more urgency. Alvarez: In the end Trump?s deportation proposals ?  and their execution ?  come back to which individuals he?ll mark first for removal. In 2014 the Department of Homeland Security said that they were prioritizing people who were threats to national security and public safety. Su: My impression is that the reason why the priorities at the federal level change was in large part because they started having and opening up a dialogue and communication with the local communities that would be affected by this. As a result what I saw [over time] in a lot of the shifting of federal priorities was actually a reflection of what the federal government was hearing from state and local officials. That in some ways was really interesting because you had a system in which the federal government wanted for their own interest to convince state and local officials to cooperate. But as a result state and local officials were able to give a broader perspective to the need and consequences of local immigration enforcement to the federal government. In some ways the Trump administration coming in is not only an immigration question. There?s a bigger picture: How dedicated are they to centralize Washington control? And how committed are they to listening to what?s happening in mainstream America?
420,73229,December?s Best Reads: Painkillers a Pentagon Scandal and Google?s New Financial Philosophy,Atlantic,Gillian B. White,1/1/2017,2017,1,,At the end of each month the editors of The Atlantic?s Business channel round up their favorite stories about money business and economics from around the web. The list includes pieces that are informative unique   beautifully told. This month?s pieces include plenty of investigations ?  one about spending abuses at the Pentagon another about dubious intake policies at   hospitals ?  and stories that focus on recurring questions such as what the American dream really is and who gets to be a part of it. If you?ve missed a recent month?s roundup you can find some here and here. ?Pentagon Buries Evidence of $125 Billion In Bureaucratic Waste? Craig Whitlock and Bob Woodward | The Washington Post For the military the major allure of the study was that it called for reallocating the $125 billion for troops and weapons. Among other options the savings could have paid a large portion of the bill to rebuild the nation?s aging nuclear arsenal or the operating expenses for 50 Army brigades. But some Pentagon leaders said they fretted that by spotlighting so much waste the study would undermine their repeated public assertions that years of budget austerity had left the armed forces starved of funds. Instead of providing more money they said they worried Congress and the White House might decide to cut deeper. So the plan was killed. The Pentagon imposed secrecy restrictions on the data making up the study which ensured no one could replicate the findings. A   summary report that had been made public was removed from a Pentagon website. * * * ?The American Dream Quantified at Last? David Leonhardt | The New York Times I mentioned to Chetty a Stanford professor and his colleagues that I thought they had a chance to do something no one yet had: create an index of the American dream. It took them months of work using old Census data to estimate   decades but they have done it. They?ve constructed a data set that shows the percentage of American children who earn more money ?  and less money ?  than their parents earned at the same age. The index is deeply alarming. It?s a portrait of an economy that disappoints a huge number of people who have heard that they live in a country where life gets better only to experience something quite different. * * *  ?Google Makes So Much Money It Never Had to Worry About Financial Discipline ?  Until Now? Max Chafkin and Mark Bergen | Bloomberg Businessweek Without any warning on the afternoon of Monday Aug. 10 2015 [Larry] Page released a letter to investors and the public. He introduced Alphabet a new holding company. Google and the Other Bets would be subsidiaries each with its own CEO. ?Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence? he wrote. ?The whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands. ? Alphabet would also begin reporting Google?s earnings separately each quarter meaning that investors would finally know how much money X and the Other Bets were losing and exactly how profitable the Google cash machine was. At the end of the letter Page attempted a joke. ?Don?t worry? he wrote ?we?re still getting used to the name too!? Alphabet?s earnings reports have laid bare just how healthy Google was under Pichai. In addition to   revenue growth in its ad business over the past year Google has unveiled a promising new assistant to compete with Amazon?s Echo and has beefed up its   division. ?More information is always better for investors because you hate to invest in black boxes? says Dan Niles founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners an investment management firm that holds Alphabet stock. But Niles adds ?the real key is that they brought in Ruth Porat. ? * * *  ?Intake? Rosalind Adams | Buzzfeed Millwood Hospital is part of America?s largest psychiatric hospital chain Universal Health Services or UHS. Its more than 200 psychiatric facilities across the country admitted nearly 450 000 patients last year. The result was almost $7. 5 billion in revenues from inpatient care last year and profit margins of around 30%. More than a third of the company?s overall revenue ?  from both medical hospitals and psychiatric facilities ?  comes from taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid. A yearlong BuzzFeed News investigation ?  based on interviews with 175 current and former UHS staff including 18 executives who ran UHS hospitals more than 120 additional interviews with patients government investigators and other experts and a cache of internal documents ?  raises grave questions about the extent to which those profits were achieved at the expense of patients. * * *  ?White Resentment on the Night Shift at Walmart? Tracie Macmillan | The New York Times From my reporter?s perspective I could see similarities between the lives of the people I spent the night shift with and those of folks I?d met covering poverty in New York City: Unpredictable work schedules damaging health and home life no dependable child care wreaking havoc on work transportation and health care so tenuous that basic household functions like grocery shopping and doctor?s appointments fell by the wayside wages that almost never matched expenses. For all the variations that race and geography produced there was a sameness to the tone of life for everyone I met who was working class which usually meant they worked but were still poor.

Jeff Passan | Yahoo Sports Trying to play Baseball Nostradamus is tricky of course because the   potential for seismic change in the sport makes predictions a   down the road murky. ?The ink isn?t even dry on this agreement yet? reminded one sage source. And yet this agreement is full of interesting levers that will maneuver the sport in a new direction ?  and many of them stem from a single decision in the last 48 hours of negotiations that divided the union and allowed MLB one of its more surprising victories in nearly five decades of   relations. When a contingent of players from the Dominican Republic showed up in Dallas it was a great sign for the union. Engaging Latin American players had proven difficult for a group whose membership had grown increasingly Latino in recent decades and here they were ready to fight for what infuriated them: the prospect of an international amateur draft proposed by MLB. The fervor with which the players railed against the draft came from a place more emotional than logical. The rearing of young baseball players particularly in the Dominican Republic is part of an economy that supports thousands. It also can take boys as young as 12 rescue them from poverty supply them with meals and training and prepare them to sign with a major league team at 16 years old. Almost every Dominican player goes through this system. It becomes a part of him. * * * ?My Awkward Money Talk With Sallie Krawcheck?

That taught Sallie that she never wanted to be in that position. She says she started working in the third grade filing papers at her dad?s law office. By high school Sallie was lending her parents money to fix the furnace when it gave out. ?I wanted to make my own money.

Adam Weiner | Politico Although he is all but forgotten now Chernyshevsky was one of the great destructive influences of the past century: first in his home country where his writing helped spawn the Soviet Union and now of all places in the United States where his rational egotism continues to reverberate in American political and economic thought. For decades Rand has been a muse to American politicians ranging from Ronald Reagan to Ron Paul to Paul Ryan to Clarence Thomas ?  not to mention businessmen like Ted Turner and Mark Cuban to say nothing of Greenspan at the Fed. The libertarian movement claims her as one of its original inspirations. And Rand?s Atlas Shrugged has become a cult classic continuing to sell hundreds of thousands of copies every year.   ?     [I]n the writings of the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach Chernyshevsky found the idea of the ?? the replacement of god by man in a materialist universe. Into this roiling cauldron of ideas Chernyshevsky dropped one last secret ingredient: Adam Smith?s ?invisible hand? the notion that an individual?s selfish gain is a gain for all society. The rational pursuit of   should form the basis for all human interactions and once this ?rational egoism? becomes universal it will result in happiness harmonious economic and political conditions and an ideal reconfiguration of the world. Or so Chernyshevsky argued in What Is to Be Done? which Chernyshevsky wrote while in prison for sedition and which despite its eclectic jumble of philosophical premises and its deplorable prose style became an instant classic in Russia. * * *  ?I Make $2. 35 an Hour In Coal Country.

421,73230,?He Was the Nationalist Candidate?,Atlantic,Emma Green,1/1/2017,2017,1,,As Donald Trump prepares to take office R. R. Reno of First Things is feeling ?guardedly optimistic. ? The editor of the conservative religious magazine cautiously supported the Republican?s candidacy. Reno does not believe Trump will fix what he sees as America?s frayed social contract. But he does think the incoming president will disrupt the current political system which he considers deeply flawed. The   Showdowns Coming in 2017 I spoke with Reno about his outlook for the coming administration. We discussed Reno?s reasons for supporting Trump (?I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for [Trump?s] policies? he said) the   (a kind of performance art he argues) and how Christian principles should influence policy (?Americans are uniquely tempted to imagine that we are a church   ?     This is one of the reasons why we?re such a dangerous country? he said). At its center though our conversation was about the possibilities and limits of   democracy ?  what makes a nation and what?s happening to visions of a global   world. Reno has sketched an intellectual framework for supporting Trump. As the new U. S. president translates his   rhetoric into actual policies this framework will be tested. It may also provide a useful way of tracking how firmly Trump comes to oppose the forces of globalization as Reno is hoping he will. The discussion below has been edited for clarity and length. Emma Green: Why do you support Trump? R. R. Reno: I wrote against him in February for an issue of National Review ?  the ?Never Trump? issue. My argument was that the Republican Party deserved Trump because its elites were so out of touch with the voters. I didn?t take Trump seriously ?  I thought he was a vanity candidate out to burnish his brand. But he was the nationalist candidate. America?s social contract is frayed and people are no longer confident that the people who are leading them have the same interests as they do. You see this in reactions to the election from liberals. They feel disenfranchised just like people on the right would have felt disenfranchised by Hillary Clinton?s election. That?s a bad sign for society when people feel like losing an election is akin to being cast out in the cold. Green: You wrote about this anxiety for the upcoming issue of First Things ?  this feeling people have of being homeless in their own country. What do you make of this anxiety? What?s your sense of where it comes from? Reno: The   era is ending. The Cold War posed an existential threat that kept people in a state of unity. After 1989 a lot of those unifying forces weakened. And globalization has had a powerful effect. We?re at the center of the globalizing project in the United States. We?re the prime beneficiaries but at the same time we?re experiencing it in a particularly acute way. It?s not clear what our politics and society are for. Green: I think a Muslim who is unhappy with the election outcome might say ?No I?m anxious right now because I believe Donald Trump might put me on a registry? or ?I have family members who are immigrants and they might be deported. ? Reno: Those are legitimate fears. Green: And they?re based on specific things Trump has said or that people tapped for his administration have said. Have these fears shaped your public and private support for Trump? Reno: It?s difficult to be a Muslim in the West because you look like the people who are trying to kill people. But you can?t have mass terrorism without people being fearful of Muslims. Responsible leadership tries to minimize that because it?s irrational. We?re fortunate in the United States: We have a small Muslim population and we also have a strong tradition of civil liberties. That combination makes me optimistic that we won?t have mass deportations or internment camps. That?s not a rational fear. Green: But Trump and his surrogates have suggested these things are very possible. Like when a Trump surrogate went on Megyn Kelly?s Fox News show and pointed to Japanese internment as the legal precedent for a Muslim registry ?  a policy Trump has appeared to support. Or Kris Kobach the Kansas secretary of state who may be considered for an administration position carrying a memo into a meeting with Trump detailing how immigrants and refugees will be tested for their belief in Sharia law. Reno: I can never get my hands around what the concrete worry is. Mass deportations? That seems so far from anything that?s possible it strikes me as an irrational worry. But special screenings of refugees from Middle Eastern countries? That?s quite realistic. We don?t know how severe terrorism will become. Maybe it?s already crested in which case these are pointless worries. But maybe it will get worse. I have talked to friends ?  moderate friends ?  who basically can?t defend any limitations on immigration. Limiting Muslim immigration may seem unnecessary now but what about a terrorist incident where 1 000 people died ?  would that justify it? My friends would say ?No. ? What about 10 000 people? They?d say ?No it?s never justified. ? Well what about if 100 000 people get killed with a dirty bomb? At some point the person is not a serious person if they don?t allow that there are situations where you would have to use dire measures to protect the citizens of our country. That?s why some voters voted for Trump. They were beginning to suspect that the people who run the country are not ultimately serious. Green: Some of Trump?s immigration policy was premised on fear of terrorism. But much of it was putatively based on creating jobs and strengthening the economy ?  or you could argue it was based on stereotypes about people from Mexico and Latin America. Reno: That they?re criminals bad people that sort of thing. Green: Right exactly. That strikes me as a different attraction for voters. In what way did Trump?s rhetoric and promise to build a border wall and limit immigration seem to you to be the right path for the country? Reno: I never took the wall thing seriously. I took it as a dramatic symbol for taking control of our immigration. If we have open borders who wins and who loses? It seems obvious to me that a    person like myself gets cheaper labor to clean my house and cut my lawn and my neighbor down the street with a   education is the one who loses. Green: So your support for limiting immigration particularly from Latin America is an economic argument? Reno: No it?s not. It?s a political argument. You can?t have a country if you don?t have borders. When I voted for Trump I was as much voting against the fantasy of open borders as I was voting for his policies which were never very clear anyways. Hillary Clinton could have laid out a plan about how to limit illegal immigration and what to do about the 11 million people who are here illegally. But she didn?t because on the left you cannot publicly have a policy that limits immigration. I mean can you think of any Democrats who have a public position that limits immigration? Green: Well the Obama administration has deported more people than the George W. Bush administration did or any other president. Reno: But do they have a public policy on it? When you?re voting public positions make a difference. If you?re concerned that we?re moving toward a   globalist future where there are no borders ?  which is my concern ?  you?re going to vote for the candidate who is opposed to that future. I hope Trump implements immigration policies in a humane way and I?ll certainly be a spokesman against him if he doesn?t. Green: Does being a Christian affect your views on immigration? When there was a surge on the border in 2014 and particularly children fleeing violence in Central America Christian organizations including Catholic dioceses on the border were often the first groups to offer them places to stay. How do you merge your viewpoints as a citizen of the United States and a Christian public thinker? Reno: It?s a mistake to expect the laws of the country to reflect the imperatives of the New Testament and the Sermon on the Mount. I applaud the efforts of the Church to provide for people in need regardless of where they?re from or how they got here. But I think it?s a mistake to turn around and expect a nation to act that way. Americans are uniquely tempted to imagine that we are a church and that we are a universal nation. This is one of the reasons why we?re such a dangerous country. In a globalist vision of the future somebody coming from Nicaragua wins and a person who is born in Sacramento loses. And a person who runs a company in Silicon Valley really wins big time. Green: How does the person in Silicon Valley win? Reno: People at the top of a meritocracy benefit most from having a global stage on which to act. It?s not an accident that we have growing income inequality in an era of globalization. Green: But what?s the argument against people from Nicaragua being able to come here escape poverty and violence and make a better life? Reno: Well how many? Green: I guess that?s up to you. What?s your ideal level of legal immigration? Reno: That?s a policy argument. I?m not sure I have any dog in that fight. We are a nation that has always had immigration ?  no one is arguing that we should not have immigrants. Green: But you think a low number of new immigrants is probably better? Reno: Moderate. We have to have a welcoming   society that is capable of maintaining social unity. I would argue that you can?t have   democracy ?  there are no   democracies. They?re all in states of civil war or parts of empires. Green: Well but the United States is a   democracy. Reno: No it?s not. It?s very homogeneous. When foreigners come to the United States they?re always shocked by how homogeneous we are. We just do a very good job of assimilating people and making them into Americans. Green: So if by ? ? you don?t mean a diversity of religions a diversity of ethnic backgrounds a diversity of national origins and a diversity of individual political ideologies ?  all of which the U. S. has ?  what do you mean? Reno: Shared heritage common identity. When you?re traveling abroad and you meet another American it doesn?t matter if they?re Asian African American or whatever ?  you hang out with them because you have shared habits of mind and sensibilities. Green: So you?re pointing to a cohesive sense of national identity. Reno: I think that?s pretty strong in the United States. Green: How are you feeling about the administration as it?s shaping up? Are you feeling optimistic pessimistic? Reno: I?m guardedly optimistic. My biggest worry is that the administration will become a conventional Republican administration. That would be a disappointment. Green: Is there evidence to suggest that will happen? Reno: Well some of his appointments are pretty straightforward Republican types: You have Mike Pence [the vice president] and Reince Priebus [the chief of staff]. But then there?s Stephen Bannon [Trump?s senior counselor and West Wing strategist] Rex Tillerson [the secretary of state] and the generals [who have been appointed to various positions]. Those are not   Republicans. Green: Do you like Bannon? Reno: I?ve never met him. He seems like a firebrand. He gave a speech at the Vatican about capitalism that struck me as very sensible ?  that without a spiritual basis it?s quite destructive. Green: Are you familiar with Breitbart and some of the things that ran on that website while Bannon oversaw it? Reno: I don?t follow Breitbart. Every once in a while they link to something we post and we get a huge amount of traffic. But I?ve looked at it. Who?s that guy ?  Milo  ?     Green: Yiannopoulos. Reno: Yeah. He strikes me as a performance artist on the right much like that woman who smeared chocolate on herself. He?s the equivalent of her in a way. I?m not sure I quite grasp the furor against people like him. I never felt that way against Andres Serrano who had the ?Piss Christ? where he put the crucifix in the jar of urine which created a big furor among the Christian right. I kind of rolled my eyes ?  it was such a tired trope. People who transgress on the right do it for the same reason why people transgress on the left: It?s a way of gaining some kind of existential freedom from a system that?s extremely constraining. There?s not much room on the left anymore for bad boys. I think the right is actually attractive to people who want to be transgressive at this point. That?s why you get this   stuff. Some of it is perverse and sincere in some ways I suppose but I see a lot of it as performance art. Green: Do you think it?s constructive and useful? Reno: I?m not that interested in it. I think it?s fake just like I think a lot of performance art on the left is fake. Fake is not the right word ?  it?s sincere at some dimension. We just live in a very complicated world where there are no alternatives. We feel like we?re trapped and for those of us who don?t like aspects of our societies it?s very difficult. Political extremism in the 1930s really had traction. I just don?t see 2016 as being like that or 2017. Maybe I?m wrong. Maybe I?m being naively optimistic. Green: Here?s another area where people have predicted potential shifts under Trump: his relationship with the press. He made many negative comments about the media during his campaign whether he was insulting The New York Times or calling out individual journalists on Twitter. Reno: Oh yes he?s clearly hostile to the media. But if you play with fire you?re going to get burned. The politicization of the newspaper over the last nine months has been astounding to me. The relentless   stuff in the news section [of The New York Times] not just in the editorial page ?  that was pretty wow. The media is in the business of making money and that has become more and more transparent. These people on TV they get paid millions of dollars and they?re manipulators. One of the things I resent on the right is Fox News which sells conservatism. When Trump attacks these newscasters and pundit types more power to him. Green: But the free press is the main organ of accountability for any government administration. Do you think attacks on the institution of the press are good for democracy? Reno:  These are hard questions. I look at The New York Times and network TV ?  these are great institutions of American society. I don?t want to see them [dismantled]. But Donald Trump is a symptom. You?ve got Stephen Colbert you?ve got Bill Maher you?ve got the guy on 30 Rock ?  Alec Baldwin. There?s this seamless web of entertainment news and the endless quest for political power and wealth. They?re all fused together now. He knows it better than anyone Trump. He?s been at the center of it for his whole adult life. Green: And you think he?s the one to fix this ?  a person who has spent his life profiting off of this complex you?re describing? Reno: Is he going to fix it? No he?s not going to fix it. Is he going to disrupt it? Well he already has. Will the disruption make things worse or better? I don?t know. I?m guardedly optimistic. But only guardedly. Green: What is the role of a magazine of Christian thought like First Things in the era of Trump? Reno: We?ve got to keep people focused on the fact that politics is not the most important thing. I think that?s very helpful ?  a transcendent orientation. Three covenants animate us: The covenant with God the covenant with family and the civic covenant ?  our collective project that we believe in together even though we fight bitterly about aspects of it. At First Things our hope is to try to restore all three of those covenants. That?s what really provides people with a sense of home and a place to stand in the world.
422,73231,And Scene: Hell or High Water,Atlantic,David Sims,1/1/2017,2017,1,,Over the last two weeks The Atlantic has delved into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2016. Today: David Mackenzie?s Hell or High Water. (The whole ?And Scene? series will appear here.) From its opening shot Hell or High Water isn?t coy about its sympathies. As the camera pans across a   town in West Texas it catches a prominent bit of graffiti tagged on the white bricks of a local bank branch. ?3 TOURS IN IRAQ BUT NO BAILOUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE US? it reads. Watching David Mackenzie?s film is the equivalent of having a shotgun muzzle waved in your face: After all this is a movie about unsubtle folk ?  bank robbers with focused if misguided Robin Hood complexes ?  living in unsubtle times. In a year when much was written trying to delve into the psyche of Middle America Hell or High Water did the same while trying to have some fun in the process. This is first and foremost a genre film a   crossing the angry   of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre with the barren modern Texan landscapes of Friday Night Lights. After their first successful robbery of the day brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) clad in ski masks drive to the next town over to stick up another branch driving past signs advertising home refinancing and debt relief. At the next bank Toby and Tanner run into a customer depositing a box of old pennies he found in his barn. ?You got a gun on you old man?? Tanner asks him. ?You?re goddamn right I got a gun on me? he replies with a snarl. As they exit the building with a handful of cash the customer grabs his revolver and shoots as they flee firing wildly at their getaway car. It?s a rollicking telling scene that doesn?t take itself too seriously despite the intense action and high stakes. Moments like these suggest Hell or High Water is a worthy resurrection of Hollywood pulp at a time when ?genre filmmaking? largely refers to expensive inoffensive franchise blockbusters. Made on a small budget and released in August when films like Suicide Squad dominated at the box office it was one of the surprise successes of the year and now seems headed for Oscar glory. The film?s screenwriter Taylor Sheridan also wrote last year?s Sicario which took a dark granular look at the bloody worthlessness of the War on Drugs. Both films he told Indiewire are about the ?  American frontier? the border states gripped by foreclosures high rates of drug addiction and the pervasive   sentiment that helped spur Donald Trump?s swift rise in the Republican primaries. ?I was exploring the death of a way of life and the acute consequences of the mortgage crisis in East Texas? Sheridan said. One might as well call Hell or High Water ?Economic Anxiety: The Movie? for the way that it cleverly illustrates how the desolation of rural America can drive truly unforgivable behavior. The nobler Toby and the   Tanner are committing their crimes for a good reason though it takes a while for their plot to fully come into focus ?  long enough that the audience is vaguely on their side without totally understanding why. But their desperation still wreaks havoc despite Toby?s good intentions (like so many   he doesn?t want anyone hurt) things slide into baser violence. Chasing them around the state are Texas Rangers Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) a grouchy odd couple who gently but persistently mock each other (Alberto ribs Marcus?s age and Marcus makes casually horribly racist jokes about Alberto?s Mexican and Native American heritage). The ?wit? on display is often painful but that?s part of Sheridan?s point ?  that the country?s divisions are drawn so deeply Marcus?s insults are one of the only ways he can relate to his partner. Hell or High Water is as jarring and uncomfortable as it is tense and fun. Yes there are parts of America that still feel like a cowboy nation ?  and everyone at the bank be they security guards or customers might be toting a gun on their hip. It?s a depiction of a region that feels at once authentic and cartoonish reinforcing stereotypes we might be loath to acknowledge while deepening them all the same.

423,73248,ISIS Ends Its Separate Peace With Turkey,Atlantic,Graeme Wood,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Ever since New Year?s Day when a gunman killed at least 39 partiers at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul watchers of the Islamic State have engaged in a familiar morbid countdown. How long until the Islamic State issues a statement taking credit for the attack? This morning the wait ended with a press release from the group avowing its authorship of the carnage. Turkish newspapers report that many of the victims died from head shots  . First they were wounded or cornered then executed. The killer remains at large. It is proper to resist the temptation to assess the gravity of this attack by noting that its body count is less than that of Omar Mateen?s Islamic   attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando (50 dead) or the coordinated attacks in Paris in November 2015 (130 dead). Allocating column inches according to these benchmarks is the very definition of normalization. (If this attack had taken place five years ago it would have prompted smothering coverage for days not a quickly expiring moment of media attention and a return to regularly scheduled coverage.) Moreover in this case especially the politics of the attack and its avowal make the Reina massacre much more pivotal than many others with higher tallies of casualties. The Islamic State has now formally ended its separate peace with Turkey. Since the group?s sack of Mosul in   when it took captive 46 Turks including diplomats from the consulate there the Turkish posture toward the Islamic State has been inconsistent at best. Turkey negotiated the hostages? freedom (at what price is unclear) and its border remained permeable to anyone who wished to cross it ?  rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar   but also jihadists bound for the Islamic State ?  for well over a year. At the same time Turkey allowed U. S.   State operations out of Incirlik Air Base. The Islamic State for its part fulminated against the Turkish ?secular? government (never mind that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is himself an Islamist) in its propaganda and even mounted a few attacks. But it never claimed an attack outright. Few doubted that the Istanbul Airport raid was the Islamic State?s handiwork and many smaller attacks have likewise been attributed but not avowed. (A car bombing in Diyarbakir in November was claimed for the Islamic State by its Amaq News Agency. But the attribution for that attack is still murky as it was claimed by a Kurdish terror group as well.) Turkey has up till now been unique among victims in never having its victimhood acknowledged by its assailant. Whatever value this fiction held it has now ended. This time is different. The press release states that the attack was ?ordered by the prince of the believers? Abu Bakr   and not merely addressed to him by an adoring fan. The Islamic State chooses its words carefully and these ones imply responsibility at the highest level. Moreover the new aggression comes after Turkey?s own tilt against ISIS through military campaigns along the western edge of the Islamic State?s territory and Baghdadi?s personal call in November for attacks against Turkey?s ?apostate? government. Last week Turkey participated in a   ceasefire involving a slate of rebel groups including several jihadist ones but not the Islamic State. That agreement demonstrates overt unforced alignment with Assad and his   allies. And it is accompanied by further Turkish military gains against the Islamic State in   the group?s former stronghold in western Syria. Just weeks ago the Islamic State chained two captured Turkish soldiers by the neck doused them with gasoline and burned them alive on camera. Hostilities are open and the game is on. The countdown I mentioned earlier ?  the   vigil kept by Islamic State analysts for the moment the attack was claimed through the group?s official channels ?  is rarely undertaken with such certainty of the outcome. The target of the attack a gathering of mostly Muslim merrymakers celebrating the end of a year as marked on the Christian calendar was pure Islamic State bait. The   raid likewise bears the group?s hallmarks. But we knew too that Turkey was by now an overripe target and another longer countdown for its inclusion on the list of countries targeted aggressively and openly had reached its conclusion as well.
424,73249,And Scene: American Honey,Atlantic,David Sims,1/2/2017,2017,1,,Over the last two weeks The Atlantic delved into some of the most interesting films of the year by examining a single noteworthy moment and unpacking what it says about 2016. Today: Andrea Arnold?s American Honey. This will be the final installment of the ?And Scene? series which can be found in its entirety here. If someone had told me a year ago that one of the most alluring cinema images of 2016 would be a ponytailed Shia LaBeouf dancing on a supermarket checkout counter I might have scoffed. But Andrea Arnold?s American Honey is a film that exists to refocus its audience?s view of things ripping us from the theater and jamming us into an environment and a part of the country that we might not fully understand. One of the most visually electrifying films of the year American Honey was also my personal favorite. Nothing crystalized its unique and surprising appeal more than the idea that an exiled marquee idol could worm his way back into moviegoers? hearts by behaving obnoxiously. As Rihanna?s ?We Found Love? blares on the   speaker system early in the film the teenager Star (newcomer Sasha Lane) spots Jake (LaBeouf) from across the store and is immediately intrigued. Jake is clad in gray suit pants held up by suspenders and a   button down and his prominent braided   is slung over one shoulder but he radiates a strange sort of   charisma all the same. The scene plays out like a childish flirtation ?  Star sticks out her tongue at him he replies in kind then starts dancing along to Rihanna eventually jumping on top of a conveyer belt and leading those around him in dance. Much like my last pick for this series Hell or High Water American Honey is not subtle about the message it?s trying to get across. ?We found love in a hopeless place? Rihanna croons as Star looks on at Jake seduced she follows him into the parking lot where he offers her an opportunity to escape her depressing life in Oklahoma. Star is gorgeous and charming but also hostile and defensive. She?s seeking any kind of escape but has no idea how to chart a path to the future she wants. Taking Jake up on his offer she joins his ?mag crew? tearing around Middle America in a van with other misfits selling magazine subscriptions    and crashing in motels along the way. Arnold a British director   in her own country?s aimless youth (her 2009 film Fish Tank is a spiritual sibling to American Honey) spent years researching her script by traveling around the country with mag crews. Their rootlessness and strange (if limited) sense of independence speaks to something appealing about America ?  that you can pick up sticks and move on in search of something different ?  as well as to the inherent limitations of that way of life. Seeing Jake is love at first sight for Star: She?s drawn in by his swagger his idiosyncratic style his joyful willingness to flout the rules of society. Their relationship as it plays out over the next two and a half hours is fiery but doomed from the minute it begins. American Honey has a garishness to it that some critics found reductive. Star?s   boss Krystal (Riley Keough) is an imperious often cruel matriarch who spends one crucial scene wearing a   bikini. In her travels across the country Star encounters families ripped apart by drug addiction   workers who have no idea how to interact with women outside of paying them for sex and various other strangers who often straddle the line between helpful and predatory. Still every lurid detail feels part of a cohesive whole. Star is a window onto a world that won?t make all viewers feel comfortable but that shouldn?t be ignored simply because of the unease it may inspire. In Jake?s initial dance and everything that follows Arnold distills the twin prongs of his appeal: He represents the thrill of   and a chance to escape both of them classic American dreams in all their dishonesty.

To sign up please enter your email address in the field provided here.     Tragedy in Turkey: Authorities are still searching for the attacker who killed 39 people and wounded at least 70 in a shooting at an Istanbul nightclub early on New Year?s Day. Yesterday ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack describing the gunman as a ?heroic soldier? acting on the orders of the Islamic State?s highest leader. Though ISIS has been suspected of terror attacks in Turkey before it hasn?t claimed one outright until now while the Turkish government has had an inconsistent stance toward the terrorist group. For these reasons writes Graeme Wood the Istanbul attack is pivotal: It adds Turkey to the list of countries against which ISIS is waging outright war. Confusion in Congress: Last night House Republicans voted suddenly and secretly to deeply undermine the Office of Congressional Ethics. Today amid outrage ?  and hours after   Donald Trump tweeted a lukewarm critique of the move ?  the Republicans called an emergency meeting to reverse their decision. The   marks an embarrassing moment for the legislators but it also foreshadows an era of ambitious and aggressive policymaking from the GOP majority ?  as well as the resistance from Democrats to go with it. Transition Trouble: With less than three weeks to go before Trump takes office his transition team is lagging behind schedule to fill positions in the new administration largely because many of the nominees haven?t been fully vetted yet. On top of late starts to the   process the team faces an extra hurdle in the fact that Trump has chosen a number of wealthy business executives whose complex financial portfolios make their potential conflicts of interest particularly hard to straighten out. Meanwhile Trump has his own conflicts of interest to worry about (you can follow our running list of them here). He has insisted that his business interests won?t sway him ?  but as numerous studies on the financial biases of doctors have shown that?s a resolution much easier made than carried out.

Megan Garber on the new reality TV: Television has long had a fraught relationship with the ?regular? person. Many of its shows from Leave It to Beaver on down have relied on the power of aspiration ?  the ideal family the ideal group of friends impossibly beautiful people inhabiting impossibly beautiful places ?  to amplify the appeal of the ?normal? worlds they?ve served up to their viewers. . .. Many of the new shows of 2016 though took that approach ?  the everyday gilded with the shiny stuff of fantasy ?  and stripped it of its varnish. The concerns that were so often in the past relegated to the plot lines of individual episodes (a   here an illness there) were put   as series overtly emphasized what used to be matters of taboo: money infidelity weight special needs. In a year in which so many things beyond politics themselves were political many TV shows continued a trend that had been brewing with the rise of social media and Peak TV.

427,73268,The Era of Republican Overreach Begins,Atlantic,Russell Berman,1/3/2017,2017,1,,?Let us not be timid? Paul Ryan exhorted members of the House on Tuesday moments after 239 Republicans had in   fashion   him as speaker. He was girding his party for what he called ?the opportunity of a lifetime? ?  the chance to remake Washington under   Donald Trump and unified Republican control of government. Ryan needn?t have worried about his members? gumption: They had committed their first act of political overreach before the 115th Congress was even sworn in. The night before a majority of House Republicans had voted behind closed doors to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics a   independent body that had arisen out of the last era of GOP scandal. They had acted rashly and against the better judgment of their leaders including Ryan who had accurately warned them that such a move would undermine the party?s effort to open the new Congress in a mood of unity and optimism. A predictable uproar ensued and with a modest push from Trump Republican lawmakers hastily reconvened to rescind their amendment barely five minutes before the 115th Congress gaveled into session. The GOP?s Ethics Disaster The episode was an    prologue for the period of Republican rule on which the nation is now embarking. It was in a sense a test of the political boundaries for a party that insists it has won a broad mandate from the voters. If Trump could get away with all manner of offensive comments damaging revelations ethical malfeasance and still get elected president what would stop lawmakers from neutering a pesky ethics office that had ensnared many of them (and Democrats too!) in investigations? As it turned out Trump?s victory did not mean the end of public scrutiny it did not immunize politicians from nasty headlines or angry phone calls emails and tweets. Republicans backed away from their ethics gambit but as Ryan made clear they are intent on acting swiftly on an ambitious policy agenda to dismantle key parts of the Obama presidency and replace them with   conservative reforms. ?We have a lot to do ?  and a lot to undo? House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in a message to lawmakers over the weekend. GOP leaders plan to devote the next two weeks to teeing up legislation that Trump can sign in his  first weeks in office. The House will vote this week on bills to prevent Obama from issuing a slew of new regulations on his way out of office and to ensure Congress has a say in major new regulations going forward. The first day in the Senate brought the introduction of a budget resolution that will lay the groundwork for repealing core pieces of the Affordable Care Act. The two chambers hope to send the actual repeal bill ?  sans an Obamacare replacement ?  to Trump?s desk in the next month or so. ?The people have given us unified government? Ryan said in his    opening address. ?And it wasn?t because they were feeling generous. It?s because they wanted results. How could we live with ourselves if we let them down? How could we let ourselves down?? If Republicans are feeling pressure to deliver results for their voters so too are Democrats under pressure to deliver a fight for theirs. The beginning of a new Congress usually brings a brief respite from the usual partisanship. Young children clog the Capitol halls as lawmakers bring their families to their   the two chambers gavel in with rituals of pomp and circumstance and   members learn the way to their offices (and to the bathrooms). But on this opening day Democrats in both the House and the Senate were digging in for battle. In a   of Republican rules designed to punish actual member protests Democratic House members embellished their speaker votes for Nancy Pelosi by adding the preamble ?Because the people?s House should be ethical accountable and open to free debate. .. ? During her ceremonial introduction of Ryan upon his election as speaker Pelosi digressed to warn Republicans that if they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act cut Medicare or otherwise roll back Obama?s legacy ?Democrats will stand our ground. ? And in the Senate the new Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York used his own opening remarks to warn both Trump and the Republican majorities that Democrats would hold them accountable across the full range of promises that they made during the campaign. ?We will hold Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great? Schumer said. ?But we?ll fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness ?  instincts that have too often plagued this country and his campaign. ? Democrats are banking on Republicans falling short ?  that the party unity on display in Ryan?s election on Tuesday will quickly fade that the slim GOP majority in the Senate will stumble and bicker that an inexperienced and impatient president will grow frustrated with his party?s struggle in Congress. And most of all Democrats are waiting for Republicans to overreach to interpret a narrow presidential victory as an endorsement of conservative dogma and push forward with   changes to entitlements the tax code and consumer protections. That they believe would invite a public backlash ?  much like the one that greeted Republicans on Tuesday after their   ethics maneuver. Republicans may have learned that the law of political gravity still applies to them. But their chastening on ethics isn?t likely to humble them on policy. GOP leaders have been waiting for this moment for a decade and don?t expect them to be timid.
428,73269,How Atheists and Agnostics Let Christians Dominate Congress,Atlantic,Emma Green,1/3/2017,2017,1,,The 115th Congress is back in session and at least one thing looks the same as usual: 91 percent of its members identify as Christians. This proportion has basically remained constant for more than five decades as long as this kind of data has been available according to a new study from Pew Research Center. What has changed is the U. S. population: Only 71 percent of American adults identify as Christians. Some religious minorities including Muslims Hindus and Buddhists are slightly underrepresented in Congress relative to their population sizes in the United States while others including Jews and Mormons are slightly overrepresented. But these groups aren?t the source of the demographic mismatch between Congress and the rest of the country. The Americans who are vastly underrepresented in Congress are those who don?t identify with any religion at all: Only one member of Congress Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona says she is religiously unaffiliated while 10 others declined to state their affiliation in surveys and interviews with CQ Roll Call. The Futility of Representing Religion With a Bar Chart There are at least two good explanations for this phenomenon. The first is that religiously unaffiliated Americans don?t vote. Another way of putting that is that young people don?t vote: According to the Public Religion Research Institute      are three times as likely to be religiously unaffiliated compared to people over 65. Even though the religiously unaffiliated share of the American population has significantly increased from 14 to 22 percent between 2004 and 2014 the share of religiously unaffiliated voters only increased from 9 to 12 percent. This chart offers a stark illustration of how politically disengaged these voters really are: Religiously Unaffiliated Americans Don?t Vote  Scholars and journalists have long decried the civic apathy of the young. But at least in terms of religious demographics it makes sense that there has not been a political revolution under the banner of irreligion: ?Religiously unaffiliated? is a category popularized by pollsters. It is a useful demographic tool but not a very useful way of understanding how these Americans think about politics. ?Religiously unaffiliated? means these Americans don?t feel like they?re part of any particular religious tradition or denomination. But that includes a huge and diverse group of people. Those who formally identify as atheists and agnostics are actually a minority representing roughly 3 and 4 percent of the American population respectively. Others in this group which includes roughly 23 percent of Americans might be in the process of changing religions or feel like they have no spiritual home in a formal house of worship. They include people who believe in God and people who might be married to a spouse with a different faith background. And they include lots of people who don?t find religion particularly important or relevant in their lives. This above all is why it?s suspect to suggest that religiously unaffiliated people are underrepresented in Congress: They are not actually a coherent demographic group. It makes some sense that people who have mixed feelings or don?t care about religion wouldn?t bother organizing to get more of their kind in Congress. It?s also possible that at least some of the members who claimed a specific faith on their CQ Roll Call survey are only nominally religious anyways. After all any pollster worth his galleons knows it?s tough to elect atheists to political office.   If this is truly a crisis of representation there?s good news. Religiously unaffiliated Americans who are bothered by their lack of a voice in Congress can use one simple trick to start making change: They can vote.
429,73270,When America Last Had Two Presidents at One Time,Atlantic,David A. Graham,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Over the holiday weekend the Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell (who has sometimes written about the 37th president in this space) delivered what might be called a historical bombshell. Using notes from H. R. Haldeman Nixon?s chief of staff he reported that despite years of insistence it was not true Nixon had in fact used back channels to kill peace negotiations to end the Vietnam War on the eve of the 1968 presidential election in order to give himself a leg up in that race. Farrell writes: But Nixon had a pipeline to Saigon where the South Vietnamese president Nguyen Van Thieu feared that Johnson would sell him out. If Thieu would stall the talks Nixon could portray Johnson?s actions as a cheap political trick. The conduit was Anna Chennault a Republican doyenne and Nixon   and a member of the   China lobby with connections across Asia  ?    . Nixon told Haldeman to have Rose Mary Woods the candidate?s personal secretary contact another nationalist Chinese figure  ?   the businessman Louis Kung  ?   and have him press Thieu as well. ?Tell him hold firm? Nixon said. The discovery is despite coming four decades after the events it describes and 23 years after Nixon?s passing timely because Nixon feels especially relevant these days ?  if not now more than ever certainly now more than any time recently. As Farrell notes Nixon?s moderation and effectiveness in enacting major reforms appeal to Democrats dismayed with the rightward drift of the Republican Party. There are also less flattering comparisons: Nixon?s legendary volatility has drawn parallels with Donald Trump?s       style and suggestions that generals might refuse to follow illegal or dangerous orders harken back to the days when Nixon?s defense secretary James Schlesinger effectively placed himself between the president and any order to use nuclear weapons. And then of course there?s a   at the Democratic National Committee during the heat of a close presidential campaign ?  it could be Watergate or it could be last summer?s hacking attacks. Richard Nixon: We Shall Not See His Like Again  But the dynamic of late 1968 with one president on his way out the door but trying to accomplish what he could and another aspiring president attempting to undermine those policies also speaks directly to the present moment in American politics. In fall 1968 Johnson was attempting to find a way to end the war which he had inherited from President John F. Kennedy and expanded and which had already destroyed his political fortunes leading him not to run for reelection. A successful negotiated end to the war would not have saved his presidency but it might have helped redeem his legacy. But Nixon worried that would help elect his rival Democrat Hubert Humphrey. As Farrell explains Nixon ?  a former vice president senator and U. S. representative ?  had a large network of contacts he could draw on to help torpedo the peace talks. Anna Chennault a Republican fundraiser had close ties across Asia through her lobbying on behalf of nationalist China. Through her and with the help of Chiang   they pressured South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu to stall talks. Rose Mary Woods Nixon?s secretary who would later become famous for erasing tapes from the Oval Office worked another connection. Other elements of the effort were far simpler: Nixon threatened CIA Director Richard Helms with firing if he didn?t cooperate. In the end Nixon?s meddling worked scuttling any peace deal. Perhaps it helped contribute to his victory in the presidential race too which he won by less than a percentage point in the popular vote. Whatever the benefit to Nixon the costs of not ending the war are clear: More than 21 000 Americans were killed in Vietnam between the end of 1968 and the American withdrawal. The effect of this strange maneuvering was that for a time foreign leaders were negotiating with two different American heads of state one elected and one not yet in office a situation that is now being repeated with Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Nixon?s extensive government experience allowed him to intervene even before he was elected president while Trump had to wait until after his upset win. Since November 8 however Trump has not been shy about jumping in.   presidents are not a new phenomenon and countries have long known that they can   through the last days of one administration to get to the next. What sticks out about Trump?s   is his willingness to break traditions by using the bully pulpit even before he possesses it. He has openly disputed the overwhelmingly assessment of the U. S. intelligence community on whether Russia is responsible for the hacks. When the U. S. government lowered sanctions on the Kremlin over those attacks Trump all but promised to reverse course once inaugurated. When the UN Security Council considered a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied territories Trump first lobbied the U. S. to veto it and then promised things would be different when he came to power. There?s plenty of space for Trump to continue bedeviling Obama in the remaining few days of his term. The president is seeking to move as many prisoners as possible out of the facility at Guantanamo Bay before he leaves office. Taking prisoners has been a good way to curry favor with Washington for the last eight years but with Trump noisily backing the facility would a foreign leader want to take the risk of annoying the incoming president a man who does not carry a grudge lightly? Nixon?s meddling in the Vietnamese negotiations is reminiscent of Trump?s interactions with Obama in another way related to the alleged Russian hacks. The White House became convinced during the presidential race that Russia was behind the attacks on the DNC and others and some analysts concluded they were intended to hurt Hillary Clinton?s campaign and help Trump?s. But Obama expecting a Clinton victory and wary of being seen as meddling in the race was hesitant to go  . Finally in early October the White House formally accused the Putin regime of involvement though it still tempered its language only offering a   condemnation after Trump?s victory. Johnson too learned of Nixon?s moves before the votes were cast ?  he had the FBI track Chennault Nixon?s Chinese national fixer. He was furious. But Johnson like Obama held most of his fire never going public with the accusation because he did not feel he could prove it. Still he seethed in a conversation with Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen an Illinois Republican. ?I?m reading their hand Everett. This is treason? he said according to Farrell. ?I know? Dirksen replied. Publicly Obama has not used any language nearly this strong though he was unsparing in his assessment of Trump?s qualifications during the campaign. But some liberal writers have been happy to haphazardly label Trump?s reaction to the hacking scandal as treasonous. Does Obama privately feel that strongly about Trump?s conduct? Some day when he?s been   for many years perhaps his presidential papers will offer a hint. For now though he?s just one of two presidents ?  and perhaps the weaker of the two.
430,73271,The Free-College Dream Didn?t End With Trump?s Election,Atlantic,Emily DeRuy,1/3/2017,2017,1,,When Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election to Donald Trump hope that the federal government might make the nation?s public colleges and universities free dwindled. The Democratic Party faithful among others were dejected. Until now. In a sign that   higher education could continue to expand in a more piecemeal fashion New York Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled a plan on Tuesday to offer   degrees at the state?s public colleges and universities for residents from families earning less than $125 000 a year. The idea is significant in part because New York is home to the nation?s largest   system ?  serving some 440 000 students ?  and the plan which will need to be approved by state lawmakers could affect 940 000 families with   children according to the governor?s office. What?s more Cuomo ?  a Democrat ?  and other advocates hope that if New York successfully makes   college a statewide reality then other states will follow. Bernie Sanders Clinton?s main Democratic challenger during the presidential primaries and a vocal advocate of   public colleges joined Cuomo who is reported to be considering a run for president in 2020. The pair explained the proposal in remarks at LaGuardia Community College in Queens. The days when a person could graduate from high school and count on a   manufacturing job ?are over? Sanders said. In the current economy ?you need a college education if you?re going to compete. ? Despite Trump?s   promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States research from Anthony Carnevale the head of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University and others back up the idea that college is still generally a solid investment. People with college degrees still earn more than those without them and   are less likely to be unemployed as more jobs than ever require a degree. But Cuomo said rising college costs and the need for many families to take out costly student loans are making it harder to get a college education than it was in previous generations. He equated beginning college with debt to ?starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg. ? Just as society decided generations ago that it would fund public high school because the economy depended on it Cuomo said society should say the same about college today. While the governor hailed his statewide proposal as the first of its kind in the country he is not the first politician to advance the idea. In 2015 Tennessee became the first state to make community college free for   seniors through a program championed by Republican Governor Bill Haslam. More than 20 of California?s community colleges now offer at least some funding and other support often with help from private businesses and foundations to local students. And where the Obama administration failed to move forward its plan to make community colleges across the country free ?  in part because of Republican resistance to Washington intervening in what some conservatives view as a state issue ?  there appears to be at least some bipartisan support for the idea of free college. Democrats have long framed the matter of free college as a way of giving all students equal access to educational opportunities no matter their backgrounds while Republicans have argued that free college benefits local economies. Cuomo touched on that argument when he said he hoped the New York proposal would be ?a   call to this nation? if the United States wants to be competitive globally. In recent years the United States has fallen behind other countries in the percentage of students who complete degrees and there are sizable gaps in college completion between white students and students of color who make up a growing portion of the nation?s young people. Less than 40 percent of students in New York?s   public universities and less than 10 percent of those at   public schools earned their degrees on time in 2013 according to the governor?s office and average   debt in the state had risen to more than $29 000 by 2015.   tuition in New York currently ranges from around $4 300 to $6 500 a year. There is no guarantee though that Cuomo will be able to convince state lawmakers to move his plan forward and not all students would be covered. The governor?s office says the plan will cost about $163 million a year once it?s fully phased in which Cuomo would like to see happen by the fall of 2019. Making   college a reality ahead of a potential 2020 presidential run would be a political boon in a Democratic primary. According to the governor?s office the program would be funded through the state?s   program ?  which provides close to $1 billion in grants to students ?  federal grants and other state funds. But whether state lawmakers who have resisted earlier   plans are willing to endorse the idea remains to be seen. And while Cuomo has supported state Dream Act proposals which would open up such funding to undocumented students who graduate from high schools in New York they are currently barred from receiving these grants meaning undocumented students likely would not be covered by the   proposal. It?s also worth noting that university fees and    costs often present as much of a barrier as tuition does to college completion with students of color   students and   college students less likely to earn degrees than their peers. But speaking briefly after Cuomo Sanders who grew up in New York said he hoped the announcement would serve as a message to the state?s children that if they work hard they will be able to get a college education regardless of how much their families earn. ?That is a message that is going to provide hope and optimism to   families all across the state? he said. If New York makes the proposal a reality he predicted other states will implement similar plans.
431,73272,Donald Trump?s Interests vs. America?s Dubai Edition,Atlantic,Jeremy Venook,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Though the biggest controversy over the New Year?s Eve celebration at      Donald Trump?s Florida estate was apparently whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having ?partied? there video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day brought renewed scrutiny to   Donald Trump?s own presence at the event. During a   speech given in front of the party?s   attendees Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani?s family saying ?The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight and they?re seeing it and they love it. ? CNN identifies Sajwani as a ?billionaire developer in Dubai? who has ?paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai. ? Trump?s spokeswoman Hope Hicks defended the remarks by clarifying that the   and Sajwani ?had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social. ? Whether or not Hicks?s statement was true Trump?s commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the   praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company?s interests. Previously he has   business partners in Turkey and Argentina while on official calls with the countries? leaders he also met and took photos with associates from India shortly after the election. Moreover as with several of the countries in which   buildings are located the United Arab Emirates has a questionable record on human rights Human Rights Watch specifically states that the nation ?uses its affluence to mask the government?s   problems. ? By singling out Sajwani Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations. According to Politico tickets to celebrate with the   at    went for upwards of $500 the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400 000 off of ticket sales for the event. (There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization such as a charity or campaign fund as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.) Whether or not the   sees it as such the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding an auction for a    meeting with Trump?s daughter Ivanka and a charity event that offered a reception with the   and a hunting trip with his two sons both of which have since been cancelled as well as ongoing speculation that foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington D. C. That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year?s Eve party lends credence to these concerns ?  it?s an instance of someone receiving the  ?s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events. The Background Since his election an   level of attention has been paid to the unprecedented conflicts of interest that   Donald J. Trump seems likely to bring with him when he assumes office. His responses to the concerns have been varied and at times contradictory. His first statement on the subject which came via Twitter suggested that he would make little effort to avoid entangling his business and his office and would instead attack those who point that out: Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! A few days later in a conference with the editorial staff of The New York Times he appeared similarly defiant asserting ?The law?s totally on my side the president can?t have a conflict of interest. ? The  ?s public stance since the election has been inconsistent at best and contradictory at worst. In an   tweetstorm on November 30 Trump announced that he would be ?holding a major news conference? on December 15 about a plan ?being crafted which take[s] me completely out of business operations? although he stressed again that he is ?not mandated to do this under the law. ? As the date approached his spokeswoman announced that he would be delaying the press conference until January. Soon after Monica Langley of The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump Organization will not be selling off its global   holdings instead Trump will be stepping down from his leadership role in his business empire and leaving it to his adult sons. However as long as the   retains a financial stake in the company the move does not mitigate his many conflicts of interest. As such several Senate Democrats led by Elizabeth Warren have drafted legislation aimed at forcing Trump to divest or face impeachment. So far the only indication that Trump may actually be distancing himself from his financial holdings is that on December 6 Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller announced that Trump had sold off his stocks in June. However neither provided any evidence of the sale and considering the  ?s history of questionable or downright false statements regarding his finances ?  see for example David Fahrenthold?s   exhaustive debunking of Trump?s claims regarding his charitable giving and namesake foundation ?  the claim remains suspect. Until proof of the transaction has been established such as by releasing broker records this article will proceed based on his FEC filings which remain the most recent documentation of his financial holdings. Central to the discussion is that as Trump has repeatedly pointed out the president and vice president are exempt from the Office of Government Ethics? rules preventing conflicts of interest within the executive branch. More recently attention has shifted to the Emoluments Clause a relatively obscure section of the Constitution barring the chief executive from receiving gifts from foreign governments which numerous experts say Trump might violate if his properties receive preferential treatment from other world leaders. However case law on the clause?s possible application is sparse. At any rate legality does not imply propriety. Unless Trump acts to put appropriate distance between himself and his business ventures these questions are likely to continue throughout his time in the Oval Office. Below is an attempt to catalogue the more   examples of conflicts of interest that have emerged so far the most recent entries appear at the top. That Virginia Vineyard Among the dozens of properties   Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville Virginia the source of his namesake wine. Since Trump was elected the property has requested temporary   visas for six foreign workers according to The Washington Post. The visas which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a   or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U. S.  employees. Trump of course will be in charge of appointing a new Secretary of Homeland Security once he assumes the presidency which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His current nominee retired general John Kelly has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS?s policy on the matter. On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the  ?s stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by   Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the   visa the   has on multiple occasions spoken critically about the   program which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry. But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example according to a Reuters report from August 2015 nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1 100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump?s    Club in Florida which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006 including 70 applications in 2015. (Meanwhile The New York Times reported that since 2010 only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the    have been hired.) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration: There is significant evidence that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words Trump?s track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now by applying for visas for his vineyard Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.  Back to table of contents That Las Vegas Labor Dispute On top of owning various properties and enterprises Trump and his company employ roughly 34 000 people according to an analysis by CNN. On December 21 several hundred of those workers resolved  a labor dispute against the   ?  one in which had it continued for even a few weeks more Trump would have had the unprecedented power to make appointments to affect its outcome. Here?s the situation: In October 2015 several hundred employees primarily housekeeping staff at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas voted to join the local branch of the Culinary Workers Union. Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC which owns the hotel and is itself owned by Trump and the casino magnate Phil Ruffin contested the vote first by enlisting an   consulting firm (for whose services it paid $500 000) and then by filing complaints with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Shortly before the election the NLRB not only rejected Trump and Ruffin?s complaints but also found that because the pair had refused to negotiate with the nascent union they had violated federal law and their hotel was operating illegally. Trump and Ruffin have since appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On December 21 more than a year after the hotel?s workers first voted to join the union the workers announced that they arrived at their first first   contract achieved according to an employee quoted in ThinkProgress despite significant pressure from ownership that attempting to unionize would cost workers their jobs. According to the union the new agreement ?will provide the employees with annual wage increases a pension family health care and job security? comparable to that of other Las Vegas hotels. Moreover the Culinary Workers Union?s parent organization UNITE HERE has reached an agreement to represent workers at Trump?s   hotel in Washington D. C.. Although this dispute has been resolved it is included here because it exemplifies the type of situation in which Trump?s business interests are likely to overlap with his duties as president. Once he assumes office Trump will be tasked with appointing members to fill current openings on the NLRB the very body that ruled against him shortly before the election and will be tasked with resolving any future disputes between the hotel?s owners and its employees. Moreover as Slate noted the chief justice of the D. C. Court of Appeals is none other than Merrick Garland whose nomination to the Supreme Court has spent months languishing in the   Congress and will likely be withdrawn once Trump becomes president. Finally if disputes of this nature go beyond the Court of Appeals the case would go to the Supreme Court to which Trump will be appointing a justice once he assumes office which is expected to tip the balance decisively in a more conservative (and likely  ) direction. In other words no matter how far up the chain future disputes of this nature go Trump?s presidency will give him new power to influence the results.  Back to table of contents That Kuwaiti Event According to an anonymous source and documents obtained by ThinkProgress representatives from the Trump Organization pressured the ambassador of Kuwait to hold its embassy?s annual celebration of the country?s independence at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D. C. The event held annually on February 25 was originally scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown the location was allegedly changed after members of the Trump Organization contacted the country?s ambassador. ThinkProgress?s source ?described the decision as political? suggesting that the embassy chose to relocate the event in an effort to curry favor with the  . The Kuwaiti ambassador has since disputed the report telling The Washington Post that he had not been contacted by the Trump Organization and that the move ?was solely done with the intention of providing our guests with a new venue. ? If ThinkProgress?s account is correct Kuwait?s decision represents an escalation of a situation that has been developing since Trump?s election. The Trump International Hotel has been the subject of continual scrutiny for the conflict of interest it poses in part because its lease explicitly bars elected officials from holding it but mainly because Trump?s ownership of the hotel will almost definitely result in a violation of the Emoluments Clause which prohibits the president from receiving payments from foreign powers ?  something that will arguably be happening any time a foreign government books a room at the hotel. Already the hotel has begun advertising itself as a destination for diplomats and dignitaries and the embassies of Azerbaijan and Bahrain have both scheduled events in the building. However before the ThinkProgress report there was no evidence that the Trump Organization had individually reached out to a foreign government in hopes of getting it to relocate an event to the hotel. Back to table of contents Those Certificates of Divestiture In addition to the many possibilities for   Trump to pursue his financial interests in office the unique makeup of his cabinet also creates a new set of financial motivations. While Trump?s own fortune automatically makes his administration the wealthiest in history he has also surrounded himself with an unprecedented collection of billionaires and   whose investments are likely to also come under scrutiny. Unlike the   himself those who are up for Trump?s cabinet such as his proposed Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will be legally obligated to divest from any holdings which may pose a conflict of interest. However as The Washington Post noted even selling off their holdings offers an opportunity for Trump?s cabinet members to enhance their fortunes. A federal program known as a ?certificate of divestiture? allows   appointees and employees to avoid   taxes when selling their assets. The program has existed since 1989 and most recently received attention when President George W. Bush appointed Hank Paulson then the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as his Treasury Secretary in 2006. Paulson was forced to sell off $700 million in shares of the bank the certificate of divestiture enabled him to avoid a potential $200 million in   tax liability. According to The Washington Post the Office of Government Ethics is currently researching whether the   himself would qualify for the tax break even if he doesn?t the unprecedented wealth of Trump?s cabinet promises to push this provision and the financial incentives it creates to the limit. Back to table of contents That Carrier Deal One of   Donald Trump?s first major economic moves as   was the deal that he and Vice   Mike Pence struck with the   manufacturer Carrier which had planned to move 2 100 jobs from its Indiana plant to Mexico. Finalized on November 29 the compromise kept 730 of the plant?s jobs in Indiana in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years. The deal immediately attracted praise and criticism on both sides of the aisle with much of the scrutiny going toward the tradeoff between jobs and tax breaks and Trump?s idiosyncratic   negotiation techniques. An additional detail soon emerged regarding the deal: According to his FEC filings (which despite Trump and his spokesman Jason Miller?s unverified statements that the   sold off his stock in June remain the most recent public record of the  ?s finances) Trump holds stock in Carrier?s parent company United Technologies. In 2014 his investment in the company was between $100 001 and $250 000 while in 2015 the stock is listed as worth less than $1 001 which could indicate that he sold some or most of the stock each year his holdings earned him between $2 500 and $5 000. The paucity of information in the FEC filings makes it difficult to ascertain why his holdings appear to have decreased regardless the investment is not only one of several hundred but also a relatively minor one among Trump?s many holdings some of which are worth over $5 000 000. As a result it?s difficult to know how much if at all Trump may have considered the stock particularly considering that he didn?t appear to remember his initial promise to save the Carrier plant. Additionally Trump does not have stock in the next company he called out on Twitter Rexnord Corporation (which is also based in Indiana) or its parent company The Carlyle Group. Still Trump?s deal with Carrier demonstrates the unprecedented challenge the  ?s conflicts of interest create: Unless he either puts his holdings in a truly blind trust or divests completely a significant number of the decisions he makes will involve some level of financial incentive for himself as well as for the country. Back to table of contents That   Issue Over the past few months a number of experts have called for   Donald Trump to either sell off his business holdings or if the illiquidity of his assets prevents him from doing so to put as much as possible into a blind trust managed by a lawyer or other trustee with whom he will have no contact. Pursuing one of these two options is seen by many as an important step to distancing himself from even the appearance that he will be considering his own financial prospects in addition to those of the nation while in office. In response Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he intends to cede control of his business to his three adult children Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric although as has been previously noted doing so would barely even create the appearance of a blind trust given how his children are close advisers members of his transition team and well his children. (Trump has also alluded on Twitter to an upcoming press conference in which he intends to more fully explain his plans although doubts remain that the arrangement he proposes will actually create the necessary barriers between Trump and his business.) Moreover even if one does take take the   at his word that his children will be entirely separate from his administration events since his election strongly suggest otherwise. All three have been seen in contexts that significantly diminish the appearance of separation Roughly two weeks before the election Donald Jr. met with a   group in Paris to discuss his father?s policy toward Syria and according to Politico was involved in his father?s search for a Secretary of the Interior he was also spotted hunting in Turkey shortly after his father?s phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan in which the   praised a Turkish business partner. Eric meanwhile appeared in photos with his father and a group of Indian businessmen mere days after the election. Officials within the State Department have begun to express frustration with the optics of the Trump family?s current system. Much of the focus though has been on Ivanka whom many consider to be among her father?s most trusted advisers and the various ways she has indicated that she will remain a part of both the family business and her father?s administration. Ivanka also appeared in the photos with the family?s Indian business partners and she and her husband Jared Kushner ?  also one of Trump?s advisers ?  sat in on a meeting between the   and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reports later emerged that at the time Ivanka was in negotiation with the Japanese apparel company Sanei International whose parent company is owned in large part by the Japanese government. A number of outlets have reported that while Melania Trump will be the official First Lady Ivanka plans to assume a policy portfolio akin to that of previous first ladies one issue she apparently plans to take on is climate change on which she recently met with her father and former Vice President Al Gore. Even the optics of physical distance are diminishing: According to CNN Ivanka and Jared plan to move from New York to Washington D. C. once the Trump administration begins. That the  ?s children appear involved in both the Trump administration and the Trump Organization presents a major threat to the   norm that presidents should distance themselves from business interests that could interfere with their official duties. Finally removing himself from    operations will do little to change the fact that Trump will retain substantive knowledge of the illiquid assets involved in his business such as the numerous buildings and other products that bear his name especially if he remains in frequent contact with his children. Even assuming that Trump does separate himself from any consideration of his holdings his children will still likely be major players in the family?s organization which will still bear at least the Trump name ?  arguably one of their most valuable properties as much of the family?s wealth derives from licensing the name to   companies. Given the family?s     (Ivanka for example briefly appeared to be distancing herself from the campaign and several properties considered rebranding under the name ?Scion? when it appeared Trump would lose) the situation epitomizes the way Trump?s and his family?s business interests may very well prove inextricable from his actions as president. Back to table of contents Those Fannie and Freddie Investments After railing against elites during the campaign Trump has so far stocked his prospective cabinet with an array of billionaires whose policy positions seem likely to significantly benefit those who are also doing very well. Trump?s putative treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin is no exception: His resume includes stints as a banker at Goldman Sachs a Hollywood producer and the operator of a bank that has been described as a ?foreclosure machine? and once foreclosed on a homeowner over a   discrepancy. One of Mnuchin?s apparent beliefs is that the government should cede control of the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which the government acquired during the 2008 financial crisis. The two financial institutions? stocks rose by more than 40 percent after Mnuchin stated that he believes the Trump administration ?will get it done reasonably fast. ? Doing so would be broadly compatible with Trump?s general antipathy toward regulation of the banking industry. However The Wall Street Journal identified an additional wrinkle to the story: When Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?s stocks rose one major beneficiary was John Paulson an adviser to the Trump campaign and a business partner of Mnuchin?s. Paulson?s hedge funds include significant investments in both Fannie and Freddie. Trump himself has invested between $3 million and $5 million across three of Paulson?s funds according to his filings with the Federal Election Commission (which remain the only available window into the  ?s financial holdings). In other words as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?s stock prices increase ?  and they have so far more than doubled since the election on the expectation that the incoming Trump administration will be more lenient toward the financial sector than Obama ?  Trump?s portfolio benefits. Back to table of contents That Phone Call With Taiwan When news first emerged that the   spoke on the phone with Taiwanese President Tsai   on December 2 the immediate reaction was uproar over his apparently impetuous breach of decades of U. S. protocol toward China and Taiwan. As my colleague David Graham explained since 1979 the United States has participated in the ?artful diplomatic fiction? of officially recognizing the mainland People?s Republic of China as the only legitimate Chinese government while maintaining loose unofficial recognition of ?  and significant economic and military ties to ?  Taiwan. That Trump would speak to the president of Taiwan especially before doing the same with Xi Jinping the president of the PRC flies in the face of a diplomatic tradition that has undergirded almost 40 years of U. S.  relations. Amid the days of dissembling that followed the phone call an additional worrisome detail came out: The Trump Organization has apparently been exploring expansion into Taiwan. Soon afterwards the Trump Organization denied that it planned to do so however even before the controversy arose the mayor of Taoyuan Taiwan the municipality in which the Trump Organization allegedly wants to build described in a televised interview a meeting with a representative of the Trump Organization in September to discuss prospective   projects and at least one Trump employee was found to have posted on Facebook that she was in Taiwan at the time on a business trip. The phone call and the many statements that have followed are of particular interest because of the extent to which they dovetail with some of the biggest concerns about Trump?s approach toward governance. In the ensuing 48 hours Republican officials offered several sometimes entirely contradictory explanations of what initially appeared to be an impulsive move by Trump depending on who was speaking the phone call was actually initiated by   (which if technically true ignores that it was Trump?s staff who arranged the conversation) was just ?a courtesy? or manifested a policy shift weeks in the making ?  although regardless it was made without first consulting the White House or State Department. The defense of the move and the questions it creates regarding conflicts of interest have largely hinged on the belief that since voters apparently don?t mind the reaction was overblown. On this issue though whether or not voters care is immaterial to the central question. The   of the United States breached decades of international protocol created to preserve a precarious balance of power. That decision raised not only the possibility that Trump was blundering into a potential international incident but also that he may have done so in part out of consideration for his business prospects. Back to table of contents That Deutsche Bank Debt Though he often brags about leveraging   law to become ?The King of Debt? Trump?s numerous bankruptcy filings have left most large Wall Street banks reticent to lend to him according to The Wall Street Journal. Among the few exceptions is Deutsche Bank which ?has led or participated in loans of at least $2. 5 billion? to the   since 1996 with at least another $1 billion in loan commitments to   companies more than $300 million of those loans have come since 2012. The  ?s indebtedness does not itself pose a conflict of interest but Deutsche Bank?s ongoing legal troubles very well might. The Justice Department is currently negotiating with Deutsche Bank regarding a preliminary settlement of $14 billion to resolve probes into allegedly misleading predatory lending practices in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis while it is believed that Deutsche Bank will push back against the sum there has been no public news regarding negotiations since the initial figure was reported in September. Trump will soon be naming many of the officials with jurisdiction over this and other deals prompting several House Democrats to send a letter to federal financial agencies calling for close scrutiny of how Trump may seek to influence the settlement through his appointments ?  although doing so would be just as in keeping with his general stance toward financial regulation as with active protection of his pocketbook. Other Democrats have called for the proactive appointment of independent prosecutors to avoid any appearance of conflict if the case is not resolved before Trump takes office. Fears that Trump may unduly consider his indebtedness to Deutsche Bank in deciding his administration?s policy toward the financial sector go beyond general anxiety about deregulation. Deutsche Bank is undergoing a period of struggle that may have it on the verge of failure already. Its stock valuation has dropped by more than half since July 2015 in January it posted its first   loss since 2008 and one of its many tranches of bonds ?  one specifically designed to be a     safety valve in times of trouble ?  has recently begun to crash. In June the International Monetary Fund called Deutsche Bank ?the most important net contributor to systemic risks? among globally important financial institutions. If the bank were to fail it could have major consequences for not only Trump?s businesses which would lose their sole remaining lender but for the global economy as well. Arguably the $14 billion fine the Justice Department is seeking to impose has exacerbated rather than alleviated these struggles. Based the company?s market capitalization ?  the number of shares multiplied by their price ?   of roughly $16 billion the sum would leave Deutsche Bank critically low in liquid assets with which to absorb future troubles. although the institution?s own   of $68 billion argues otherwise. But given the complexity and potential volatility of the situation it is important for any decision to be free from outside influence something Trump?s outstanding debt threatens to jeopardize. Back to table of contents That Secret Service Detail During the election the Trump campaign put no small portion of its funds toward paying for use of the candidate?s own properties perhaps the most notable of these expenditures was the nearly $170 000 the campaign spent in July on rent for its headquarters in Trump Tower. These expenses raised the possibility that as Trump predicted in 2000 he ?could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it. ? Now that he will be president he may be able to profit off of the Secret Service by virtue of the fact that he and his family will live in Trump Tower and fly in his private jets ?  which requires the agents tasked with guarding them to pay him rent and airfare. The first way Trump could monetize his own protective detail is by having family members travel in his two planes and three helicopters. This is not so much speculative as foregone: Over the course of the campaign the Secret Service which traditionally pays for its own travel during elections spent $2. 74 million to fly on a plane owned by one of Trump?s own companies. Once Trump takes office he will fly exclusively on Air Force One while Mike Pence will be riding Air Force Two. However their families may still be flying on Trump?s private planes ?  along with their protective details which would effectively direct even more money to Trump. (Previous first families have flown with a detail whose legal purview covers ?the immediate family members? but none have done so on planes they themselves own.) A bigger question regards Trump Tower in New York where the   appears likely to spend a significant amount of time. For the past few decades it has been common practice for the Secret Service to provide protection for the president and vice president?s   House residences which sometimes entails paying rent to the officeholder. (Joe Biden for example
432,73273,Don?t Read Too Much Into the Vermont Hack Debacle,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,1/3/2017,2017,1,,On Friday evening The Washington Post reported that hackers affiliated with the Russian government had penetrated the United States electric grid by attacking a utility company in Vermont. The story was originally illustrated with an image of the headquarters of a Russian spy agency which it alleged was behind the intrusion. Then on Monday the Post published a new story walking back its allegation of Russian interference. Now it says the internet traffic that raised the red flag may in fact have been harmless. The confusion would seem at first to provide new ammunition to cybersecurity skeptics like   Donald Trump who has claimed repeatedly that it?s very difficult to attribute cyberattacks to their perpetrators. He has said that the hacks into Democratic organizations and operatives before the election could just as easily have come from Russia China or ?some guy in his home in New Jersey? despite the intelligence community?s official October assessment that the Russian government directed the attacks. But the nonexistent Vermont   attack shouldn?t shake Americans? confidence in the ability of security researchers and intelligence agencies to root out the identity of an attacker. It?s a difficult job and it can?t always be done quickly but performing accurate digital forensics is the bread and butter of both private cybersecurity companies and government intelligence agencies. Consider the differences between the mess kicked up around the Vermont power company and the attribution of the cyberattacks that targeted Democrats before the election. This weekend?s misinformation about the Vermont case was the result of leaks from government officials to the Post based on an initial report from the company Burlington Electric Department. After the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security published a document with details about Russian   and instructions about how to report suspicious online activity to appropriate federal agencies Burlington Electric performed a scan of its networks. It found ?suspicious internet traffic? related to a single computer on the network which was not connected to the electric grid system the company said in a statement and shared that information with the authorities. The company also said that government officials told them of similar traffic elsewhere in the country indicating that Burlington Electric wasn?t the specific target of a cyberattack. Somewhere in the   game of telephone between Burlington Electric the federal government and reporters at the Post the relatively mundane details about the malicious activity on the company?s network ballooned into a Russian assault on the U. S. electrical grid. ?It?s unfortunate that an official or officials improperly shared inaccurate information with one media outlet leading to multiple inaccurate reports around the country? said Mike Kanarick the company?s communications director in a statement. That?s a very different path than the one that led investigators to the perpetrators of cyberattacks on Democrats which resulted in the leaks of emails and opposition research from the likes of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. As far back as September 2015 the FBI reached out to the DNC to alert it to potential Russian activity it had detected in the DNC?s computer systems. But those warnings which were delivered with little urgency weren?t immediately heeded ?  and it wasn?t until April 2016 that the organization hired Crowdstrike a cybersecurity firm to scan its networks. Crowdstrike immediately found evidence of two separate intrusions from Russian intelligence agencies and publicized its findings the following month. And in October one month before the election the U. S. intelligence community announced that its 17 agencies were ?confident? of Russia?s involvement. Of course believing that Russia was behind the hacks on Democrats requires trusting the federal government?s ability to make that determination and the truthfulness of its account as well as the integrity and skill of the security researchers at Crowdstrike who were hired by the DNC. Trump Is Wrong That Investigators Have to Catch Hackers in the Act The combination of the groups? conclusions strongly suggests that Russia was indeed behind the cyberattacks but decisive evidence hasn?t been made public ?  and it probably never will be. ?I?ll be honest with you: When you?re talking about cybersecurity a lot of it is classified and we?re not going to provide it? said President Obama at his   news conference last month. The president asked the intelligence community to serve up a complete analysis of   hacking before the end of his term on January 20. Parts of it will be shared with lawmakers who may choose to release unclassified details to the public. Whether people will believe what does get released will depend on whether they trust the government to get it right and to act in good faith. But whatever your degree of confidence in the feds an official   assessment should carry far more weight than a leak from an overzealous unnamed official based on incomplete information to newspaper reporters who got it wrong.
433,73274,Why the Technology in ?Rogue One? Is So Old-Fashioned,Atlantic,Bryan Alexander,1/3/2017,2017,1,,We expect certain storytelling forms to pay special attention to setting. Historical fiction spends a great deal of energy in recreating the past. Fanfiction does something similar for its source material. Science fiction and fantasy fans expect  . Rogue One a combination of all of these forms does this very well on multiple levels.   It is after all science fiction and the Star Wars universe has long had a strong fantasy vibe. Being a work by other creators in a beloved franchise built by others the movie is very much like fanfiction.  And given the way the movie?s setting and plot slot into a specific timeline within the Star Wars universe it?s pretty close to a work of historical fiction.  Accordingly we get meticulous recreations of shots dialogue plot points sound tracks characters spacecraft various other technologies and famously or notoriously two actors one dead the other aged nearly a   past her original performance. The technological aspect tugged at my mind.  The presentation of a galactic empire?s tech and infrastructure was staunchly retro even reactionary. To explain: David Edelstein notes that the movie ?rehashes the plots of about a thousand World War II   Western films in which a brave squadron ?  a Magnificent Seven a Dirty Dozen a Force Five ?  prepares to sacrifice itself in the name of a greater cause. ?  That?s because the technology looks and acts like it?s from WWII.  We see switches cables heavy doors grenades machine guns (?blasters?) a staff and sniper rifles but no radiation weapons or gamma ray bursters.  Stormtroopers drive a truck rather than enjoying say a   trawler. Spaceships are there but act entirely as fighter and bomber aircraft or as naval warships.  We never worry about the vast distances between stars time dilation the enabling technology artificial gravity or really anything at all about space travel. Similarly computers are basically typewriters and radio receivers.  The movie?s main plot point the Death Star plans which activate the first movie?s action are essentially physical not digital.  They are stored as a physical object in a gigantic file system then mostly passed from hand to hand. When they briefly act electronically it?s as a radio transmission often with specialized radio operators complete with giant headsets. There are very few mobile devices and they don?t matter. There is a robot companion yes   but in the style of many robot depictions he is in practice a skilled human being.  In appearance he resembles something from early Soviet technology hulking and either   or actively hostile. He?s dieselpunk not  . Speaking of cyberpunk in Rogue One there is no sign of the communications world after the internet. There aren?t any networks. Nobody hacks anything or checks anything online. Coding doesn?t appear to be a thing.  There seem to be few networked sensors as when attack after attack surprises enemies who only detect them visually (i. e. no radar no distributed sensor arrays). Documents are unique it seems and hardly copied. This is true even of military documents ?  ironic given that one of the key motivators for creating ARPANET was preserving those very things. Weirdly communication satellites don?t seem to exist or at least matter. The movie is even more retro than this WWII level when it comes to media.  There are no cameras or microphones.  Nobody records films photographs or surveils anyone else.  When a hologram recording (in all ways a film strip) plays nobody makes a copy.  The one person who watched it simply remembers the gist without bothering to shoot someone a copy or even write it down.  In fact there aren?t any media either entertainment or news.  You might expect a   empire fighting an insurgency to have a serious propaganda effort under way.  Instead it?s a semiliterate nearly   realm. (For comparison?s sake consider the continuous stream of media populating Children of Men enjoying a ten year anniversary.  Newspapers radio television offer an ongoing stream of information about that world.) Rogue One?s fierce   nature expresses itself in what we see of its world?s society and politics. Previous Star Wars movies described rebooted medieval and early modern sociopolitical structured lodged in interstellar space.  Hence an emperor rules an empire and senators work alongside aristocrats and feudal power arrangements.  Unlike say Frank Herbert?s Dune universe where changes in technology made older structures functional again Star Wars just ignored any technological impact to copy and paste pulpy history onto the future. Rogue One continues this unsurprisingly with some updates towards the 19th and 20th centuries.  There?s the empire of course with its   mix of Nazis and Ming the Merciless.  Under its sway we see criminals religious fanatics and leftover warrior knights (Jedis the Star Wars version of our world?s Teutonic Order).  Family relations are also from the early 20th century a classic nuclear family (only one child) anchoring the protagonist.  Her gender roles are partly retro too as her mother matters far less than her father and she risks her life and mission to save a child from a firefight. Advanced technology has not extended lifespans or eased health problems.  There are no signs of genetic engineering medicine beyond 1950 (other than whatever the heck was involved in the heroine?s mentor?s outfit) or starvation alleviated by improved nutrition or even replicators.  Cities are   colonial in overcrowding and poor conditions.  It is as if technology has been abstracted away from social life or is arrogated to a powerful elite who otherwise keeps the populace in relative degradation. Perhaps the galaxy is run by a group of historical reenactors who insist everyone join their hobby in a kind of vast dystopia. So why does Rogue One do this?  Obviously it wants to hew to the original movies mostly the first one and Empire Strikes Back so the movie matches its technology with theirs. We get a nice echo of that late ?  ?80s grungy technology vibe as seen in for example Blade Runner and Alien. We don?t get   keyboards smartphone or time dilation problems because the source material lacks them. Beyond that formal reason why would this fiercely retro approach appeal to today?s audience?  And appeal it does with box office above $64 million as of today per IMDB. We could ask them same question about similarly retro steampunk as others have done.  The answers include a desire to flee what some see as daunting   in our present day responding to feelings akin to Toffler?s famed future shock. But steampunk is a distinctly different era anchored on Victorian Britain not the 1930s not dieselpunk. People like steampunk for many other reasons including the fashions and I think a strong sense of appropriated cultural smugness. No Rogue One turns to the second World War because it wants that struggle?s cultural cachet. Evoking WWII sets the movie up for epochal struggles a strong good versus evil theme a seamy resistance plot and especially massive amounts of sacrifice and death ?  the very opposite of steampunk.  I wonder how this appeals to an America a decade and a half into the global war on terror.  Was the studio hoping to tap into residual anxieties about distant enemies and the burdens of empire? Were they counting on   somehow fading away? I suspect the   technology milieu engages two audiences. For younger people who?ve grown up with some degree of digital immersion this must appear to be an exciting alternate dimension. Rogue One is in this way akin to vinyl records and postcards.  For older people (generalizing here) it?s nostalgia. Not only does it remind us of seeing the first movie back during the Carter administration but is also recalls traces of the world we thought we once inhabited. The tangible tech bereft of PowerPoint and sleek touchscreens reminds us of say shop class working on cars wiring up circuits. For both audiences Rogue One slyly connects with the maker movement. Meanwhile both audiences can enjoy the movie then write about it on their smartphones as they leave the theater checking Twitter and Facebook for friends? opinions and consulting Rotten Tomatoes for more reviews. Let?s see how this determined   plays out in 2017?s popular culture.
434,73275,The Bachelor Gives Nick the Redemption Edit,Atlantic,Megan Garber,1/3/2017,2017,1,,There are many ways to be a villain on The Bachelor. You can be overly aggressive in pursuit of the Bachelor or Bachelorette whose heart ?  and in the meantime whose rose ?  you are seeking. You can be disrespectful of your fellow contestants. You can be overly emotional. You can be not emotional enough. Or you can be if you are Nick Viall all of those things at once: a   villain ?  someone who is not villainous in one particular way but whose villainy instead accretes episode by episode by way of bad behavior and good editing. In his two seasons as a contestant on The Bachelorette Nick a   software salesman from Wisconsin annoyed the other guys by bragging about his connection with the Bachelorettes in question and also by writing fawning poems and also by singing weird songs with sexually explicit lyrics. During the live After the Final Rose special that concluded Andi?s season Nick violated one of the cardinal if unspoken rules of Bacheloretteism: He discussed what happened between the two in the Fantasy Suite ?  the one place where a couple can interact away from the show?s otherwise omniscient cameras. And he revealed that he and his   had indeed had sex during their stay in the Suite. Cue for Andi the  . So it was a matter of   controversy then when in August The Bachelor announced that Nick for all this aggregated awfulness would get rewarded with a prize that is even more valuable than a telegenically red rose: He would be the next Bachelor. Come January Nick would have 30 women ?  not just beautiful women but also ?accomplished? ones the show goes out of its way to insist ?  vying for his heart. It was a casting decision that presented a challenge for a show that for all its glitter and fluff revolves around its own implied moralities: about marriage and the path that should lead to it about sex about the things that make one in one of the show?s recurring phrases ?deserving of love. ? With Nick who snagged the bachelorship over the expected candidate the sensitive cowboy Luke The Bachelor?s producers needed to find a way to have it both ways: to benefit from the   drama of a controversial Bachelor while also maintaining the moralism of a televised mating routine that demands that its participants all of them be ?there for the right reasons. ? Their solution it seems: The Bachelor is insisting that its star while still ?controversial? has changed. Nick is a villain no longer it claims but a man whose prior mistakes have now made him more intent than ever to Find Love. ?This is the season of redemption? Kathy Griffin ?  yep that Kathy Griffin ?  announced in a special leading up to Monday?s season 21 premiere. And during the premiere itself The Bachelor?s host Chris Harrison laid things out yet again: ?From bad boy to Bachelor? Harrison said with ceremonial solemnity ?we?ve all seen Nick grow. ? With Nick?s season the show that perfected the villain edit and more recently the crazy edit is giving its viewers a new one: the redemption edit. The groundwork for Nick?s comeback story was established this summer when he made his third appearance on the franchise?s shows as a contestant on Bachelor in Paradise. That season?s villain spots being already occupied by Chad and Lace and Ashley the show found another role for Nick: as a   adviser to Ashley as a good boyfriend to Jen as an affable friend to all. Nick?s willingness to participate in three rounds of   established him as the best thing the show can imagine a person to be: as someone who believes  in Love and who is willing to undertake whatever ritual humiliations Journey might be necessary to find it. The Crazy Edit: The Colorful Cruelties of Bachelor in Paradise That narrative spilled over into the new season of the show. Nick The Bachelor?s Season 21 made clear on Monday would redeem himself from his previous villainy not just by abandoning the antics of the past but also by searching with earnestness of heart and purity of purpose for ?a woman to spend his life with. ? Monday?s premiere began with Nick receiving adorable dating advice (be   be honest ?don?t mumble?) from his young sister. It continued with the typical stuff of Bachelor  : with shots of Nick joking with his large family (he?s one of 11 kids) and running pensive and shirtless and looking longingly into the middle distance. But the episode also added for good measure a heavy dose of payback. Many of the show?s new contestants as they introduced themselves to their suitor on the   driveway of the Bachelor Mansion made a point of bringing up Nick?s past to him. Taylor a therapist from Seattle announced at length that her friends had warned her about Nick and his villainous ways. Many of the other women ribbed him for being a   loser on the show. They all tempered the typical   with acknowledgements that this time around the Bachelor isn?t perfect. Instead he?s perfectly flawed. He is probably dear viewer a lot like you. And so with that The Bachelor has found something that might well be as compelling    as villainy: forgiveness. The Bachelor has always relied on fairy tale frames for its narrative drama now it will be Nick ?  Snow White clad in a   suit ?  who may or may not be saved by his lover?s kiss. Will he be able to redeem himself in the eyes of the women competing for him and in the eyes of the members of Bachelor Nation? Will he be there in the end For the Right Reasons? Will he be finally Deserving of Love?  If Nick ?gets down on one knee? at the end of the series Chris Harrison noted soberly during Monday?s premiere ?he?s also asking that person to forgive him for all the mistakes he?s made in his life. ? Or as Nick put it to a fan as he embarked on his    tour of the nation: ?If we hug will you like forgive me??
435,73276,Mariah Carey Feeds the Schadenfreude Cycle,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,1/3/2017,2017,1,,On New Year?s Eve Mariah Carey gave 2017 an ominous   by grimacing and complaining rather than singing or even correctly   through two songs later saying that technical errors prevented her from hearing her backing tracks. It was the kind of moment a fiction writer wouldn?t put on page for fear of being too unsubtle. Without 29 years in the public spotlight without her unbeaten slew of No. 1 hits as a solo artist without the gymnastic comparisons her vocal range once inspired without her zany ?diva? persona ?  the     diet the      policy the ?I don?t know her? moment ?  and without her every recent singing error having gone viral the internet might have served up some ?welp 2016? jokes and moved on. Instead there were cracks like this ?   2016 was channeling The Little Mermaid and ended the year by stealing Mariah Carey?s voice.  ?  and images like this ?   A photo posted by vincenzo (@vincent_casimir_) on Jan 3 2017 at 1:47am PST  ?  both of which knowingly or not flip an internet fandom trope in which Carey is shown as Ursula and her presumed rival Ariana Grande plays Ariel. It?s a perfect example of how Carey has become a catchall target of attitudes about aging femininity and talent after all the   read of The Little Mermaid is way too easy with a girl made to trade her speech for love and an elder woman evilly coveting a younger woman?s abilities. Donald Trump Makes War on Celebrities Carey has also long embodied America?s conflicting attitudes around celebrity with the hunger to create idols matched by a hunger to tear them down. Her original success came from a physical gift ?  a vocal range ?  comparable to athletic ability extraordinary but bound to diminish with time. Around that talent she built a persona a business a following and an impressive recording catalogue all of which remain intact even as her voice does what voices do: age. Her recent E! reality show Las Vegas residency and bookings like Times Square on New Year?s Eve demonstrate a demand for her to remain in the public eye. But the gleeful social media response to this latest bust of a performance also demonstrate how some element of tragedy is now part of her appeal. Carey knows America likes to laugh at her for evidence see her tweet after the performance or see the fact that she is blaming the New Year Eve debacle on sabotage. She wandered around without singing for two of the three songs she?d been set to perform her camp says because Dick Clark Productions repeatedly ignored Carey?s technical warnings ?  perhaps for cynical reasons. ?We live in this viral world where anybody will do anything for a viral moment? Carey?s manager Stella Bulochnikov told EW. Dick Clark Productions has called such allegations ?absurd? but regardless of the truth of the matter a viral moment happened serving up something for everyone. The people who like to tell Carey to just quit got to sound off again. The folks morally opposed to   and backing tracks ?  even in a loud   environment like Times Square on New Year?s Eve ?  got to preach their beliefs. Carey?s status as a    performance artist commenting on fame and delusion simply by existing was further cemented. The national pastime of resenting the rich while also paying them continued. And more than anything the Mariah Carey fan army got to do what it now exists to do: defend. It?s all a reminder that schadenfreude is one of the most powerful forces in pop culture ?  a negative complement to the praise that makes any particular celebrity successful. Justin Bieber?s tabloid antics release   adult disdain for a boy superstar Kanye West?s mental health troubles gave some an opportunity to discredit his boasts to genius Kim Kardashian?s robbery was a chance to condemn conspicuous consumption. And Mariah Carey may not have performed her hits on New Year?s Eve but other people got the pleasure of singing their same old songs about her.
436,73277,27 Movies to Look Forward to in 2017,Atlantic,David Sims,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Another year another spell of films to anticipate delight in and dread. There will be sequels superheroes and Star Wars of course but there?s plenty else on offer from Hollywood this year ?  and smaller projects in the hopper that are sure to surprise in the coming months. Here?s a look at some of 2017?s most notable projects. Split (January 20)  What It Is: M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense Signs) having rediscovered his skill at making entertaining horror schlock with 2015?s The Visit is back for more with a truly absurd   act. James McAvoy plays Kevin a menacing predator who kidnaps three teenage girls and locks them in his basement they then realize that Kevin suffers from some (entirely fictional) form of   disorder that manifests as 23 different characters in one body. If You Need Convincing: After years in the Hollywood wilderness with flops like The Last Airbender and After Earth Shyamalan has rediscovered his mojo by tapping back into the   charm that made him a star director in the first place. Split looks like a ridiculous but entirely   thrill ride early reviews from Austin?s Fantastic Fest were largely positive. John Wick: Chapter Two (February 10)  What It Is: A sequel to one of the biggest cult surprises of the decade this Keanu Reeves action thriller promises more of the same from 2014?s    sensation John Wick. Reeves plays Wick a terrifying former hitman for the mob he?s lured out of retirement for some   reason ridiculous balletic violence ensues. Joining the cast this time around are Common Ruby Rose and Reeves?s Matrix   Laurence Fishburne. If You Need Convincing: John Wick was one of the most genuinely electrifying things Hollywood has produced in years. It was trash but glorious trash with a visual panache and penchant for   that kept it from feeling disposable. It also correctly deployed Reeves one of Hollywood?s most fascinating stars when given the right vehicle. The John Wick director Chad Stahelski is at the helm for Chapter Two though his partner David Leitch has moved on to other projects. Hopefully lightning can strike again. The Great Wall (February 17)  What It Is: An epic fantasy drama from Zhang Yimou one of the masters of contemporary Chinese cinema about a gritty band of soldiers and bandits trying to protect the Great Wall of China from a monster invasion during the Song Dynasty. The most expensive Chinese film ever made The Great Wall has already grossed a stupendous $150 million in its native country. If You Need Convincing: You may considering the controversy that broke out last year upon the release of the film?s trailer which emphasized Matt Damon over the other actors and drew complaints of whitewashing. Zhang and Damon have pushed back against the notion saying the film is a historical fantasy and that Damon?s character was always written as white and is one of five heroes in the film (the other four are Chinese). Whatever the case the film may herald the dawn of a more international era in   filmmaking since worldwide audiences are more and more crucial to Hollywood profitability. Get Out (February 24)  What It Is: A satirical horror film from the director Jordan Peele one half of Key  Peele. When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) visits his white girlfriend?s family estate for the first time he realizes that something bizarre is afoot and frantically tries to escape after another African American in town warns him to ?get out. ? Allison Williams Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford   as the initially pleasant but ultimately sinister family. If You Need Convincing: Peele is a comic genius and a   horror fan. For his debut feature (he wrote and directed) he?s teamed with the veteran producer Jason Blum (Paranormal Activity Insidious and many more) to make something both genuinely scary and  . Peele has described Get Out as a   Stepford Wives. Logan (March 3)  What It Is: A   to Hugh Jackman?s   performance as the mutant superhero (coming 17 years after his first appearance in  ) Logan takes place in a vaguely apocalyptic future where the clawed menace embarks on one last effort to protect a young mutant girl. If You Need Convincing: Superhero fatigue may well have set in a long time ago for some viewers but Logan looks like a surprisingly   intense work uninterested in tying into another other sequels or spinoffs. Its director James Mangold made the last highly underrated Wolverine movie this one is rated R and promises both an adult tone and an actual ending for the character. Kong: Skull Island (March 10)  What It Is: The latest attempt to revive one of the most famous monsters in Hollywood history this King Kong take veers away from the 1930s   of the last remake (Peter Jackson?s 2005 film which hewed closely to the 1933 original). Instead set in the ?70s Skull Island follows a group of explorers and soldiers who stumble across the giant ape. Tom Hiddleston Samuel L. Jackson Brie Larson and John Goodman star. If You Need Convincing: Another King Kong film seems painfully unnecessary and the film is being positioned as the start of a new franchise that will eventually cross over with Godzilla. But the trailer has a surprisingly peppy   quality to it promising glorious fun from its monster rather than the usual grim tragedy.     Beauty and the Beast (March 17)  What It Is: An unnervingly   remake of the 1991 Disney animated classic starring Emma Watson as the   Belle trapped in a castle with its monstrous lord (Dan Stevens) a prince transformed into a furry beast by a witch?s curse. Expect singing dancing and great heaps of CGI as these two crazy kids try to figure things out. If You Need Convincing: Well Disney certainly doesn?t think you will. Its   remakes of animated classics (Maleficent Cinderella and The Jungle Book) have all been colossal successes a good way to simultaneously appeal to older generations and younger viewers craving spectacle. From the opening bars of its score Beauty and the Beast will play on its audience?s every nostalgic desire and it?ll capture hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. The Fate of the Furious (April 14)  What It Is: The eighth (and certainly not final) entry in the sprawling cinematic franchise that has morphed from entertaining   drama into an arcane colorful   series of   spy capers. After bidding a sad goodbye to Brian (the late Paul Walker) in Furious 7 Fate is charting darker territory with hero Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) seemingly turning to evil thanks to a new character Cipher (Charlize Theron). One imagines that all is not as it seems. If You Need Convincing: Watch the previous seven Fast  Furious films. Their convoluted evolution from   car hijinks into a   action soap opera is unlike anything in recent Hollywood history and will bond you to the franchise. The franchise?s incredible run can?t last forever but so far it?s shown no sign of slowing down. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May 5)  What It Is: The first of three (yes three) Marvel movies in 2017 returns to the intergalactic fun of Peter Quill aka   (Chris Pratt) Gamora (Zoe Saldana) Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and all the rest. Kurt Russell is on board this time as Peter?s mysterious father no doubt it will all have something to do with Infinity Stones again. If You Need Convincing: Guardians of the Galaxy is pound for pound the most entertaining film Marvel has ever produced and its   James Gunn is back on board for the sequel. Also Groot (Vin Diesel) is a little baby tree now and if you aren?t sick of seeing him in advertising yet you will be. Alien: Covenant (May 19)  What It Is: After largely baffling audiences with Prometheus his 2012   to Alien Ridley Scott seems to have returned to more conventional territory with Covenant another adventure set before his 1979   horror classic. It?s about a spaceship that stumbles on some weird eggs on a mysterious planet and then gets terrorized by an alien. Sound familiar? If You Need Convincing: Scott seems aware that he alienated viewers by veering away from the Alien formula in some ways with Prometheus. Though he?s retained that film?s star Michael Fassbender (who plays dual roles here) he otherwise seems to be attempting a   of Alien down to the new hero Daniels?s (Katherine Waterston)   short hair. Baywatch (May 26)  What It Is: A shameless effort to revive another ultimate ?90s brand Baywatch features plenty of chiseled stars (Dwayne Johnson Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario among them) as a team of   lifeguards. They?ll fight crime run around on the beach and wink to the camera as much as possible. David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson will contribute their expected cameos. If You Need Convincing: Then you?re not the ?  demographic that studios are banking on these days. At best Baywatch might have the knowing comic touch of Zac Efron?s Neighbors films more likely it?ll resemble the director Seth Gordon?s other perfunctory   efforts like Horrible Bosses and Identity Thief. Wonder Woman (June 2)  What It Is: She fought alongside Batman and Superman last year and now she gets a starring role. After decades of attempts the famed Amazon warrior certainly the most iconic female   superhero is finally getting her own movie directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and starring Gal Gadot. A period piece the film will explain how Wonder Woman ended up in the modern world departing her home island to fight in World War I alongside her love interest Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). If You Need Convincing: The DC Comics film universe has been deathly grim so far with neither Batman v. Superman nor Suicide Squad winning over critics. Wonder Woman looks far brighter and more colorful in contrast. Marvel is still yet to produce a film starring a female superhero so look for Warner Bros. to draw as much attention as possible to Gadot?s starring role. The Beguiled (June 23)  What It Is: Sofia Coppola?s first film since The Bling Ring (2013) is a remake of the 1971 Civil War drama itself based on the Southern Gothic novel A Painted Devil. Colin Farrell will take Clint Eastwood?s original role as a Union soldier nursed back to health at an   Mississippi boarding school. Elle Fanning Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst  . If You Need Convincing: Coppola?s last period film   (2006) was a visually lush work that subverted many of the norms of the   costume drama. The 1971 version of The Beguiled is a fascinating strange work that defies easy categorization Coppola has assembled a terrific cast to try and do the same in 2017.  : Homecoming (July 7)  What It Is: A new dawn in synergistic franchise programming as Marvel Studios takes the reins of a character owned by Sony thanks to complicated   bits of corporate machination. This iteration of   (played by Tom Holland) made his debut in Captain America: Civil War last year. In Homecoming he?ll fight the Vulture (Michael Keaton) in his own movie though Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) will  . If You Need Convincing: Captain America: Civil War was a strange   of a film but Holland?s upbeat portrayal of a teenaged Peter Parker was its most winning element. We may not need a sixth   film in 15 years but we?re getting one so it?s nice that the casting is on point. Dunkirk (July 21)  What It Is: An epic recreation of the 1940 evacuation of Dunkirk a miraculous rescue mission that saved hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers in the beginnings of World War II. The director Christopher Nolan has assembled a huge ensemble for the film ranging from frequent collaborators Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy to legendary thespians Mark Rylance and Kenneth Branagh and One Direction?s Harry Styles. If You Need Convincing: Nolan is for his flaws one of the finest   filmmakers of the moment. Films like Inception Interstellar and his Batman trilogy work their hardest to deliver widescreen   without being overloaded with CGI. Dunkirk shot entirely on   IMAX film stock looks breathtaking if nothing else. The Dark Tower (July 28)  What It Is: A   adaptation of Stephen King?s famed Dark Tower series set in the mythical   a magical spin on the Old West. Idris Elba stars at Roland Deschain a frontier knight who wields a pair of revolvers while Matthew McConaughey plays the film?s villain Walter Padick. If You Need Convincing: King describes the   saga as his magnum opus and many directors have taken cracks at adapting it including J. J. Abrams (who eventually decided he was too fond of the work to take the necessary plot liberties to translate it to screen) and Ron Howard. Howard eventually passed it along to Nikolaj Arcel a Danish filmmaker who made the   A Royal Affair. Whether Arcel and the books can survive the move to   Hollywood remains to be seen but it?s an exciting question. Baby Driver (August 11) What It Is: A   thriller about a young talented getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) who works for different bank robbers and gets ensnared in trouble when a heist goes wrong. Jamie Foxx Jon Hamm Kevin Spacey and Lily James make up the rest of the cast. If You Need Convincing: Baby Driver marks the return of the   Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) to the big screen. After his last acclaimed project   comedy The World?s End he was sucked into and spat out of the Marvel engine resigning from   during   over creative differences with the studio. Wright is one of the most exciting action directors alive so Baby Driver should be a great engine for a comeback. American Made (September 29) What It Is: Based on a true story American Made depicts the life of Barry Seal a TWA pilot who became a drugs and weapons smuggler for the Medellin cartel while also working for the DEA eventually getting mixed up in the   scandal. Tom Cruise plays Seal with Sarah Wright Domhnall Gleeson and Jesse Plemons  . If You Need Convincing: Cruise?s last project with American Made director Doug Liman was the fantastic   thriller Edge of Tomorrow. The role of Seal who seems   at best could be a fun departure for the star who has largely stuck to genre films in recent years (he?ll also star in The Mummy this summer). Blade Runner 2049 (October 6) What It Is: Exactly what it sounds like ?  a sequel to Ridley Scott?s 1982 masterpiece Blade Runner set in the year 2049 (30 after the events of the first film). The plot that we know is pretty simple: LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) a ?blade runner? tasked with retiring android ?replicants? goes on a quest to find Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who?s been missing since the events of the first film. If You Need Convincing: The plot might seem like a carbon copy of another   sequel Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But the look of the film as seen in its announcement trailer is pretty   and director Denis Villeneuve made Arrival one of the best films of 2016. Among the supporting cast are Mackenzie Davis Jared Leto and Robin Wright. Logan Lucky (October 13) What It Is: A comedy starring Channing Tatum and Adam Driver as brothers who plan a heist during a NASCAR race. Daniel Craig Hilary Swank Katherine Heigl Katherine Waterston Riley Keough Seth MacFarlane Katie Holmes and Sebastian Stan make up the   cast. If You Need Convincing: The cast is that loaded because Logan Lucky is directed by the great Steven Soderbergh who has ended his   retirement from filmmaking to make it. His retirement was   (only four years) but any Soderbergh project no matter how thin the plot is worth getting excited for. The Snowman (October 13) What It Is: An adaptation of Jo Nesb?s bestselling detective novel The Snowman follows Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) as he investigates the disappearance of a woman whose scarf is found wrapped around a snowman. Rebecca Ferguson J. K. Simmons Val Kilmer and Chloe Sevigny  . If You Need Convincing: This project was initially attached to Martin Scorsese but it ended up in the hands of the Swedish director Tomas Alfredson who made the delightfully moody Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Nordic mysteries have been tough for Hollywood to translate but Alfredson might have the right touch for it. Thor: Ragnarok (November 3) What It Is: The third entry in Marvel?s Thor series sees the Norse god of thunder (Chris Hemsworth) embark on some sort of intergalactic journey. His mischievous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) will surely be involved as will the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) Cate Blanchett plays the film?s villain Hela while Tessa Thompson is the new love interest Valkyrie (Thor?s old beau Natalie Portman has decided she doesn?t want to make any more Marvel movies). If You Need Convincing: The Thor movies are almost criminally underrated much happier to indulge in fun mystical antics without too much needless exposition and anchored by Hemsworth and Hiddleston?s comedic chemistry. Ragnarok has a fantastic director: New Zealand?s Taika Waititi whose What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) were cult hits. Red Sparrow (November 10) What It Is: A spy thriller starring Jennifer Lawrence based on the 2013 novel by CIA veteran Jason Matthews that was acclaimed for its attention to detail. Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova a Russian intelligence officer who matches wits with a hotheaded rookie CIA agent (played by Joel Edgerton). If You Need Convincing: After delivering fairly sleepy performances in  : Apocalypse and Passengers last year Lawrence is in need of a home run. Perhaps the director Francis Lawrence (no relation) who worked with her on the Hunger Games sequels can conjure one from her. Justice League (November 17) What It Is: Superman (Henry Cavill) Batman (Ben Affleck) Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) The Flash (Ezra Miller) and the mysterious Cyborg (Ray Fisher) unite to battle evil as DC Comics? famed  . Zack Snyder directs from a screenplay by Chris Terrio (Argo). If You Need Convincing: Snyder?s run as a   director is decidedly mixed (he made 300 Watchmen Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman) but he seems to have taken criticism on board. The   trailer for Justice League displayed a much lighter tone than usual for him perhaps an acknowledgement that people actually like to have fun when they see superhero movies. Coco (November 22) What It Is: The second of two Pixar films this year (the first Cars 3 comes out in June) Coco is an entirely original story inspired by the Mexican Day of the Dead. It?s the first Pixar feature to feature a   protagonist but little is known about the plot other than that it follows    Miguel as he finds himself in the realm of the dead. If You Need Convincing: Pixar films have a storied track record especially their original works (which are accompanied by a depressing number of sequels these days). Coco?s director Lee Unkrich last worked on the acclaimed Toy Story 3 his   Adrian Molina wrote the film?s script and is a veteran of the animated department. Darkest Hour (November 24) What It Is: A historical drama focusing on British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he faces down Nazi Germany and ?faces a crucial moment? at the beginning of World War II. Sure to be an Oscar player given its heavily   protagonist and   release date. If You Need Convincing:  The director Joe Wright (Pride  Prejudice Atonement) is in need of a rebound after Pan his disappointing take on Peter Pan. Alongside Oldman the film features Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI and John Hurt as Churchill?s predecessor Neville Chamberlain. Star Wars Episode VIII (December 15) What It Is: The eighth in a popular series of   films that have been kicking around Hollywood for the last few decades. Will likely make a few bucks at the box office. If You Need Convincing: At this point you probably don?t but the still untitled Episode VIII is in the hands of Rian Johnson a generally brilliant director behind   works of genius like Brick and Looper. Also maybe this time Luke Skywalker will get some lines!
437,73278,How Trump Had It Both Ways on Congressional Ethics,Atlantic,David A. Graham,1/3/2017,2017,1,,This post was updated on January 3 at 12:24pm.   Donald Trump has shown a rare talent for leaving his own allies and friends in a difficult and awkward spot and he demonstrated that talent again on Monday weakly condemning a move by House Republicans to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics as a misplaced priority while also calling the office ?unfair? ?  a very public demonstration of why even the  ?s strongest allies sometimes find it difficult to follow his lead. Within hours of his tweets and amid broad public outcry the House Republican caucus called an emergency meeting and pulled the amendment ?  a black eye for the congressional GOP and its leadership perhaps made even more humiliating by the public rebuke from their own  . Trump weighed in around 10 a. m. on Tuesday about 14 hours into a hubbub over the House move. With all that Congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog as unfair as it . .... ...may be their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS At first glance it looked as if Trump was picking a fight with Congress which to a certain extent he is. But that overstates what he actually said. Trump went out of his way to acknowledge the complaint voiced by some members of Congress that the ethics committee stepped on their   rights and was  . (Norm Ornstein makes the case for the committee here.) His only complaint was about the timing and priority of the move needless to say Trump would like the House to focus first on the things that he cares about most. Trump?s tweets seem to demonstrate his keen ability to read an audience and react. They came after hours of pushback but at a time when the fate of the amendment still seemed undecided ?  and leaning toward survival. By stepping into the debate when he did he may have helped tip the balance against it but he may also have jumped in just in time to claim credit for a shift that was already underway. Put yourself in the shoes of Representative Bob Goodlatte who on Monday put forward an amendment in the GOP Conference to gut the office. On the one hand Trump spent the last month of the campaign claiming he would ?drain the swamp? of corruption in Washington while Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy the House Republican leaders both opposed Goodlatte?s amendment. On the other hand Trump demonstrated no public interest in fighting corruption since he got elected and has obstinately refused to acknowledge much less mitigate his own conflicts of interest. It must have seemed like a safe bet that the   would look the other way. The GOP?s Ethics Disaster  That?s presumably what Kellyanne Conway a Trump adviser was surmising when she went on MSNBC?s Morning Joe on Tuesday and faced a series of hostile questions about the House Republicans? move Monday night. While Conway said she had not spoken with Trump about the vote she offered a strong defense of gutting the office saying that the GOP maintaining control of Congress meant ?there?s a mandate there for them to make significant change. ? Ryan was left somewhere in the middle too. He opposed the move within the conference but he still allowed the rules package to proceed. Shortly after Trump?s tweets he issued a long statement trying to have it several ways. The speaker acknowledged ?After eight years of operation many members believe the Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process and ensure it is operating according to its stated mission? but he also insisted he had ?made clear to the new Chair of the House Ethics Committee that it is not to interfere with the Office?s investigations or prevent it from doing its job? a somewhat toothless demand. Trump?s mild scolding does point to the tensions to come between the White House and the Republican Congress which have made great efforts to project unity despite Trump?s   departures from ?  and sometimes flagrant disrespect for ?  the party line. One division is on Russia where Trump has refused to even countenance the idea that the Kremlin was involved in malicious hacking in the presidential campaign while many GOP members of Congress see it as dangerous intervention by a hostile regime. Gutting the OCE is another case where congressional Republicans have their own interests and intend to pursue them. After all the GOP caucus has undercut ethics rules before the OCE was created after a series of scandals involving Republican members and members have wanted to remove that threat for some time. After calling an emergency meeting around noon the House Republican caucus abruptly reversed course removing the amendment to gut OCE from the rules package ?  a reversal as sudden as the introduction of the rule. That?s embarrassing for Goodlatte perhaps the only member who is known to have supported the amendment since the vote on it was private and anonymous. Ryan whose Tuesday morning statement signaled acquiescence with his caucus is also caught somewhat out in the open showing that his control over members is weak. But Trump wins as he always seems to do: He gets credit for helping sink the maneuver imparting some ?drain the swamp? glow without his actually taking steps to fight corruption or even to condemn dismantling ethics watchdogs. And how could he have done otherwise? Picking a real fight with Congress on ethics would carry the risk that it might have a change of heart and actually start pushing Trump for accountability on his own ethical challenges. Moving to pass the ethics rules now was a page torn right out of the Trump playbook: The theory is that you can get away with doing things that are egregious violations of norms and even ones that might be politically toxic if handled through the typical political process if they are instead dealt with brusquely casually and secretively. By the time the gutting of OCE was known it was already passed and incorporated into the rules package and the opponent best positioned to stop it Paul Ryan had already been steamrolled. But they play turned out not to work as well for the House as it has for the  . It will be much harder to pass later after having been pulled for public outcry. The abrupt demise of the amendment suggests two lessons for Republicans in Congress: Guessing Trump?s mind is impossible and the tactics that work for him are liable to blow up in anyone else?s face.
438,73279,The Original Sharing Economy,Atlantic,Ilana E. Strauss,1/3/2017,2017,1,,At the Sharing Depot a storefront in Toronto $50 a year buys tens of thousands of dollars? worth of tools camping supplies furniture games toys sports equipment and much else. At least on a   basis: The owners of the space call it a ?library of things? and anyone who pays the annual membership fee can borrow anything in the Sharing Depot whose aisles look a lot like those at a regular   store. The difference is that everything on the shelves can be checked out like a library book. Ryan Dyment a   of the Sharing Depot explained that his business takes advantage of the fact that people own things they hardly ever use. ?We?ve produced way more than what we need to live well? Dyment says. ?There are basements and garages full of stuff. ? The Sharing Depot opened in 2013 and currently has more than 2 200 members. Roughly a dozen stores around the world call themselves libraries of things but unofficial sharing libraries are much more plentiful. According to Dyment there are about 80 tool libraries established in North America Europe and Oceania and there are probably many more that operate on smaller scales. Also lots of equipment owned by universities is available for public use and farmers sometimes develop   programs to spread out the cost of using large machinery. Aside from promoting a spirit of community the Sharing Depot?s model is also financially beneficial for the people who use it. Borrowing instead of buying can save money and it makes it easier for people to obtain things that would usually be beyond their means. ?It levels the playing field when everyone has access to the same things? Dyment explains. He says his kids can now for instance ?get new toys every week if they want to. ? Likewise when Dyment sold his car and started using a   service he says it saved him $10 000 a year. People who share don?t ?have to play this game of ?How do I get enough digits in my imaginary bank account to access these things? ?? he says. And sharing is of course easier on the environment. ?Our economic model doesn?t work with the environmental needs we have? Dyment says. ?I think we need to move to a situation where people are working less and consuming less but they?re sharing more. ? He laments that so many   products are now made not with durability in mind but with an eye on planned obsolescence. Stronger   products would be among other things better for sharing. Today it?s taken for granted that nearly all objects belong to someone. But while the spirit of the Sharing Depot is a break with the present it has historically been the norm:   ?  which is what humans were for most of the time they?ve been humans ?  are thought to have shared nearly everything. According to Sam Bowles a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts   likely didn?t have a conception of private property. ?Among mobile   during the late Pleistocene food was almost certainly widely shared as it was acquired? Bowles wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ?If you didn?t share? he says ?you?d be violating a basic social norm. ? And according to the anthropologist David Graeber?s 2013 book Debt: The First 5 000 Years the Iroquois used to stockpile goods in longhouses and women?s councils would decide who could use what. This jives with the communal storage spaces that archaeologists have found at the sites of villages of some   who were among the first to turn sedentary. This idea of sharing everything matches observations of   tribes that still exist today. ?They?re very free with one another?s things? explains Daniel Everett an anthropologist at Bentley University who spent years studying the Pirah a group of   in the Amazon. Everett remembers lending things to the Pirah only to find that the borrowers were ?continually mystified? when he came back to pick up an item. ?They are always incredulous when I?d come over to get it? he says. ?I wasn?t using it and they needed it so what?s the big deal?? He explains that while one person in the group might primarily own an object the property is all but private. ?They frequently take each others? things and there?s no fuss about it? he adds. Bowles based on his and others? research thinks that private ownership may have originated around 11 000 years ago as humans started farming. Agriculture and private property likely evolved together since farmers are generally loath to let others reap what they have sown. As some   settled down in fishing villages and other areas where there was plenty of food to be found or grown they started building private living spaces. Archeological evidence suggests that they slowly stopped storing food communally and started keeping it in their houses instead. ?What farming allowed people to do is take a very small plot of land or particular group of animals   ?     and say ?This is mine?? Bowles explains. But farming was ?not a bargain in terms of standard of living? Bowles says. An hour of farming actually yielded fewer calories than an hour of hunting and gathering and early farmers were shorter had worse teeth and were likely less healthy than  . But the populations of farmers grew more quickly than those of the     largely because being rooted makes it easier to have a lot of kids: It?s hard to take care of lots of young children when constantly on the move. A group of   might consist of only 30 adults while a farming village might have thousands. This population disparity made it easier for farmers to take over  ? territory and use it for farmland. ?They eventually took over the world? says Bowles and they brought their system of property rights with them. Indeed that?s essentially what happened only a few centuries ago as Europeans arrived in Australia Africa and the Americas where some peoples were   some were farmers and some were something in between. But until the 1700s nearly every human settlement ?  even long after conceptions of private property had taken shape ?  had a ?commons? shared land that locals could use for farming crops and grazing animals. In medieval England local juries decided who was allowed to use certain tracts in what was a pretty democratic system explains Ellen Rosenman a University of Kentucky professor who specializes in English history. The governing of the commons wasn?t completely egalitarian ?  wealthy farmers had extra influence for instance. But people who truly needed something got it: Villages set extra land aside for the poor and the extremely rich were often not allowed to use common land. ?Sometimes people who had no money were allowed to use the land for free? Rosenman says. Unlike modern farmland which is usually divided into   parcels English commons were doled out in strips. As a result farmers would work alongside each other making it easier to share tools and help each other out. ?In general it was a more communal way of life? Rosenman explains. ?It was designed so that everyone in the community could survive. ? This all started to change during the Industrial Revolution when better technology made farming much more profitable. Businesspeople seeing a new opportunity were eager to grow food and governments were apparently happy to give them the land to do it: A slew of what were called ?Inclosure Acts? were passed in the U. K. between 1750 to 1850 explains Rosenman as communal land was given over to individuals most of them wealthy. ?Big land owners kind of gobbled [the commons] up? Rosenman says. ?By the time it was all done there was virtually no common land anymore. ? According to Rosenman the farmland itself suffered as a result. Laborers hired by big landowners weren?t all that invested in the land they were working on so they didn?t always take care of it very well ?  a historical echo of Dyment?s   complaint that many consumer goods aren?t designed or bought with   usage in mind. Historians disagree about how these acts affected people?s lives. Some for instance note that many at the time were excited that farming had become more efficient. But Rosenman points out that that the vast majority of   writers considered these land claims a disaster. Commoners lost their farms and with them ?they lost their claim to being part of the nation? Rosenman says. ?The psychic consequences? ?  a reduced sense of independence and identity ?  ?were massive. ? The English commons are a pretty good example of how land went from public to private in other places throughout history: New technologies made industrial agriculture viable wealthy landowners overtook small farms and displaced farmers found work elsewhere a lot of the time in factories. This script did not always play out without resistance though. A variety of communities ?  from native groups to   laborers to religious orders ?  have fought against the idea of private property. In the 1500s for instance some adherents of Anabaptism a branch of Christianity argued that private property contradicted Jesus?s view that God created the world for everyone. Acting on their views they took over a town in Germany and outlawed private property. ?God had made all things common as today we can still enjoy air fire rain and the sun in common and whatever else some thieving tyrannical man cannot grasp for himself? preached one of the Anabaptists? leaders.   communities that discourage private ownership are less rebellions than they are isolated pockets of   cultures.   American utopian communities proposed a more communal way of life just like the   Israeli kibbutzim which often share everything from food to tools to laundry machines. In a similar vein Amish communities have ?barn raisings? in which whole communities get together to build a barn for an individual. But today the sharing that most people engage in is more often digital: Music games videos computer code programs ideas research and articles are all frequently shared for free online to the point that the internet is the closest thing there is to a   commons. And in what has come to be called ?the sharing economy? the internet enables people to sell access to everything from extra bedrooms to car rides to video equipment. Companies such as Uber and Airbnb allow people to quickly and efficiently secure temporary use of things that belong to someone else. But   companies exist in the same economy that McDonald?s and Starbucks do. Uber Airbnb and the like ultimately depend on profit not generosity. Ownership is still private everything is rented not truly shared. The sharing economy might be a significant step toward more efficiently tapping into the wealth of physical things owned by individuals ?  as opposed to corporations ?  but it?s still vastly different from the kind of sharing that defined humanity for tens of thousands of years.
439,73280,The Friendship That Created Behavioral Economics,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,1/3/2017,2017,1,,The term ?the economic man? or homo economicus is attributed to John Stuart Mill. It represents one way economists have studied people for decades ?  as rational   actors whose behaviors and actions can be modeled. But then came the psychologists. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky are often referred to as the fathers of behavioral economics for demonstrating that the human brain relies on mental shortcuts and biases in   which often leads people to irrational ends. Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 for ?for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science especially concerning human judgment and   under uncertainty.? In 2011 he wrote a   book Thinking Fast and Slow about his research with Tversky. The pair might seem an unlikely subject for writer Michael Lewis who wrote the bestsellers Moneyball The Big Short and Flashboys. In his new book The Undoing Project Lewis tells the the lives of Kahneman and Tversky the friendship that ungirded their   research and ultimately how that friendship unraveled due to physical distance (when the two took jobs at different institutions) and tension over recognition of the work they did together. I talked to Lewis about why he wrote about two academics the impact of their research and the 2016 election through the lens of Kahneman and Tversky. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation is below. Bourree Lam: Why you decided to pursue this book project about Kahneman and Tversky and their research? In the preface you mention Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein?s review of Moneyball which pointed out that what you described in that book was essentially behavioral economics. But The Undoing Project also seems to me a labor of love. Michael Lewis: The reason I got so interested in the first place was just that spending time with Danny Kahneman was so interesting. I wanted to go back for more without ever thinking that this was going to be a book. [The project] immersed me in him and becoming immersed in him meant becoming very familiar with his relationship with Amos. Then I thought: I had this privileged access I had this combination of a relationship with Danny and a prior relationship with Amos?s son who was my student at [the University of California]. I didn?t know he was Amos?s elder son at the time I just knew him as Oren Tversky but I was very fond of him and we were friends. The Tversky family was willing to open up to me. The more I learned about it I thought: These guys were for the ages. If you could have been a fly on the wall with Freud or Darwin or Einstein   ?     I thought these guys were a big deal and nobody had told their story. I didn?t have any doubts about the importance of the subject. What compelled me to do it ?  though I didn?t feel like it was naturally my subject ?  was a feeling that if I didn?t no one else would because no one else would have the access. Lam: How much time did you spend with Danny? And when did you decide it was time to start writing? Lewis: (Laughs) You know you stop counting. We first met in the end of 2007. We made a trip to Israel together. I went and helped teach his class at Princeton. We?d go for long walks in the hills of Berkeley when he was here three months of the year. I don?t know how much time when you add it all up together but enough time so that there wasn?t anything I didn?t hear three times. I?ve had this with subjects often where they think I?m stupid because I?m asking the same question in a different way for the eighth time just trying to see if there?s anything else there ?  a memory an insight ?  and I could tell I was getting that way with him towards January of [last] year. There wasn?t much left to talk about that we hadn?t talked about 18 different ways. In the course of thinking about the book I laid it out over a period of a couple years it becomes clear what you need what material is necessary. Once all the gaps are filled in I don?t feel like there?s much work left to do on the reportorial side. I just sense that I have the story in my head and I?m ready to write. Lam: The three pillars of the book are biographical stories about Kahneman and Tversky the way their personal stories informed their relationship ?  which led to their Nobel winning work. How did you see the balance and interconnectedness of those three elements and what fascinated you about them? Lewis: It?s funny I didn?t think of the structure that way. I was telling the story of this relationship but I knew I wanted to do something tricky with the structure. I wanted to cut out quickly into the world and show the ideas at play in the world. The book opens with 30 pages in a basketball front office and my struggle was: How do I weave their relationship and the creation of the ideas together with the consequences of their ideas in the world? I was constantly struggling with how do I jam the reader?s nose into the fact that this is not just two academics in a room spinning   ideas that have nothing to do with anything in the world? How do I jam the reader?s nose into the consequences like life and death in the world or decisions about human beings in the labor markets? That for me was the thing I just agonized over. Lam: What was it like to write about academics and specifically these two? Lewis: I can?t think of another intellectual project that touches as much of human existence as their work in such an interesting way. I think they?re very unusually important and relevant. If they were just academics I never would have even begun this project. What drew me to them was the life of their ideas outside of academia and that they themselves were constantly thrust into practical affairs by Israel. The fact that they had spent time on the battlefield and were constantly kind of on call by the Israeli government and the Israeli military. .. Their unusual interaction with the world outside of academia made the story possible. If it were just two guys in a room I never would have written it. They?re constantly being stimulated by stuff outside of the academy. Much of their work is mocking the academy. Amos explicitly and Danny implicitly end up having very little time for their own field. They create their own subfield within the field and then they go about poking holes in economics. A lot of their interactions with their fellow academics are   ?     it?s not hostile but it?s certainly ironic and irreverent. I also thought that possibly a lot of academics would benefit from every six years going to shoot at people and get shot at. Lam: Really? Lewis: Yes. I think that it sort of puts everything in perspective. These guys were never going to have time for petty academic battles and they had a gift for avoiding getting sucked into them. They?ve got the perspective of what people who are fighting actual battles go through. They?re not interested in the little things they?re interested in the big things. I think they get that perspective because it?s forced upon them because this all might end at any moment. There?s an urgency to their academic life their intellectual life that I think grows out of their experience in Israel. Lam: Can you say more about what you found interesting about the way their ideas reach beyond academia? A lot of readers know you as a storyteller of narratives about money or finance. How does this book fit into the repertoire of your work? Lewis: Some of my work at least is clearly exploring the weird things that markets do. They screw up the value of baseball players they screw up the value of   securities. Even the political book I wrote I found myself drawn to a candidate the process had no time for because his type wasn?t valued. So the distortion of value that goes on in markets or in people?s minds directly connects up to [Kahneman and Tversky?s] work. Moneyball comes right out of their work. Why do professional athletes get so badly misvalued? Part of the answer is there are distortions and kinks in the minds of the people doing the evaluations and these guys were exploring that. I wasn?t interested in them just because I thought they helped explain some of their work I was interested in them in particular because of the intensity of their feelings for each other. But there?s no question that in their work are ideas that I wasn?t even aware had come from them. I?ve been obsessed since I left Wall Street with the problems of financial advice. I just don?t understand why people take it. These guys have a lot to say about that and they also have a lot to say about why people shouldn?t take it. Their work on randomness ?  how people see random sequences as not random and see patterns where none exist ?  you see this everywhere. You see this in people getting a reputation for being really great with money you see it in people getting a reputation for being really great at picking hits in the movie business or picking baseball players in the draft. Many of the things around us have a random component a lot of luck involved. The human mind doesn?t see the luck it sees the pattern and this is one of their first great insights. Lam: Another one of their great insights is how predictable and systematic mistakes and thinking errors can be. Lewis: That?s the very big idea that collides with economics. If the mistakes aren?t systematic then economics can ignore them. They?re showing that we?re hardwired for certain types of mistakes so people are mostly going to make these mistakes. Then you have the beginning of a story where whole markets can go wrong and this is what Richard Thaler picks up on. He thinks of them as having one idea: systematic error. That would be filtering it through the lens of an economist who?s dissatisfied with the   model in economics. I think they have dozens of ideas. So back to your first question about what got me into this. When I would go out for walks with Danny this stuff just tumbles out of him. I thought this is just gold. This guy is and even dead Amos was full of all of these nuggets of wisdom that if you add them all up together they?re more important than the formal work. Lam: Your work has been about market failures in different realms so I have to ask are you going to write about this last election? Lewis: [Laughs] I have to ask should I? Do you think anybody?s going to want to read anymore about this? Everybody wants to know what happened. Everybody wants their dream explained because everybody feels like they woke up and are still in this dream. I have no plans to write about this I certainly don?t have plans to write about the election. That?s not to say I won?t. Now if someone called me from inside one of the campaigns and told me ?You know there?s a part of the story no one?s ever told. Here?s all of the information? I mean I?d be   to resist it. But I?m not actively pursuing it. I?m more interested in what happens next. Lam: I do feel like people are trying to gain some insight from The Undoing Project regarding the 2016 election though. Lewis: Well it?s a market for a politician but people have this sense that the market did something really screwy and they?re not unjustified. There?s a very clear sense right now that a lot of the people who voted for Trump may not have been voting in their best interests. It really seems like an irrational act to put this man in office especially to people who didn?t vote for him. And so people want to understand what was going on in the minds of these people. I did find myself listening with a kind of Kahneman and Tversky ear to what was going on around me after the election. But the first thing I noticed was how people undid it. You could predict given their discussions how the imagination works and how the undoing was going to get harder and harder. As Danny points out when a tragedy just happens it?s easy to undo it. You start from the event and the first thing that you can undo moving backwards in time and change the result you change: So the FBI director?s email or the ground ball that goes through the first baseman?s legs in the bottom of the ninth inning or the   kicker missing at the end of the game. This is all the same stuff. But then what happens is the consequences of Trump pile up. To undo the election your mind has to undo all this other stuff that happens as a result of Trump being elected and you just stop doing it. It will seem quaint in six months to be talking about the FBI director and what he did with the emails people won?t feel that it changed everything. There?ll be a sense that this was always going to happen that we were always going to have Trump as President that whatever happens will feel more determined or more inevitable or fated than it actually was. I was listening to that this brief moment after the election where people appreciated that this wasn?t a deterministic event and lots of things could have happened to prevent Trump from being president but their minds fixated on just a couple of those things. I don?t think Trump knows any of this. I think he?s just making it all up as he goes along but he?s really   to being both a victim and a beneficiary of the [human thinking] mistakes that Danny and Amos point out. He?s pure intuitive judgment and he?s appealing to other people?s pure intuitive judgment. There?s no real strong rational argument he?s making about why he should be president. Lam: But that?s why many people remain confused that he won. Lewis:  That?s right. He?s saying vote for me trust your gut. If you look at what Danny and Amos studied it?s just that. Somewhere in the back of people?s minds when they?re trying to connect my book up to the election that?s what?s in their minds. But I didn?t write it because of the election. I?ve been doing this for eight years. I didn?t see any of this coming. I didn?t connect any of it to the election or anything like that so this is just an accident.
440,73281,The Most Vulnerable NASA Missions Under Trump,Atlantic,Marina Koren,1/3/2017,2017,1,,About a week before the presidential election NASA invited reporters to its facility in Greenbelt Maryland to look at the observatory it hopes to launch in two years to a point far beyond Hubble?s orbit where it will continue that telescope?s search for distant stars and galaxies. Charlie Bolden the head of the space agency took questions including one from a reporter for The Guardian who asked Bolden whether the program was safe regardless of the election?s outcome. Bolden cracked up immediately and the rest of the room followed. He explained that most of the billions of dollars in funding the James Webb Space Telescope received was spent early on in its   development. He wasn?t worried now ?but I think anybody would be crazy to tell you that anything survives over a transition.? Bolden along with many in the room believed back then what the polls and the pundits did: Donald Trump wasn?t going to be elected president. A week later few were laughing. The day after the election Bolden sent a memo to NASA employees that likely wouldn?t have been necessary had the country elected Hillary Clinton. After all Clinton had vowed to continue the work NASA did under the Obama administration. ?In times when there has been much news about all the things that divide our nation there has been noticeable bipartisan support for this work? Bolden wrote. Because of that ?I think we can all be confident that the new Trump administration and future administrations after that will continue the visionary course on which President Barack Obama has set us. ? Some projects like the James Webb Space Telescope are safer than others under a Trump administration. Webb an $8. 8 billion enterprise has been in the works for two decades and employs hundreds of people. Trump like most presidential candidates said little about space policy on the campaign trail. Most voters want to hear about the economy not Europa. ?Right now we have bigger problems ?  you understand that?? Trump told a    boy at a campaign event in New Hampshire last November when the child asked about NASA. ?We?ve got to fix our potholes. You know we don?t exactly have a lot of money. ? For now imagining space policy under a Trump administration is akin to reading tea leaves. The same goes for future funding for NASA which could be sapped to help pay for completely unrelated programs like large tax cuts or expensive infrastructure repairs. A new NASA administrator won?t be named until next year and barring any foreshadowing tweets Trump could wait as Obama did until his second year in office before formally announcing his   agenda. But Trump?s space policy has already begun to take shape and there?s plenty to divine. His team for NASA began meeting with agency employees at the start of this month. His picks for top administration jobs so far combined with his biggest   allies in Congress suggest a future that?s good for   exploration but bad for climate research. The NASA?s earth sciences division which studies climate change and environmental conditions on Earth is perhaps at greatest risk. In an October   in SpaceNews a pair of Trump advisers wrote that ?NASA should be focused primarily on   activities rather than   work that is better handled by other agencies. ? The agency they said focuses too much on ?politically correct environmental monitoring. ? The division has seen increases in funding in the last eight years but Republicans in Congress have proposed cuts at every turn. With both the White House and Congress in Republican hands   experts are bracing for significant losses. One of the authors of the   Bob Walker a former chairman of the House committee on science space and technology said last month Trump?s decisions surrounding NASA ?will be based upon solid science not politicized science? like climate change. The same   dismissed the concept of rocket launch systems that are completely bankrolled by the taxpayer money arguing instead for the investment of reusable systems developed by private companies like SpaceX and Orbital ATK. The authors were referring to the Space Launch System (SLS) the rocket Congress instructed NASA to build in 2011 to someday launch astronauts to Mars. Greg Autry a professor at the University of Southern California and one of the members of Trump?s transition team for NASA has criticized the SLS saying it lacks ?both innovation and a mission.? He has proposed cutting funding for the program altogether and supporting   developers. Many scientists and the Obama administration agree and the president has proposed cuts to the program. The SLS is a young project with construction starting in 2014. But the system has staunch supporters in Congress especially among Republicans who represent states where the system is being developed. Richard Shelby and Jeff Sessions the Republican senators from Alabama have fought cuts proposed by the Obama administration. Sessions is also Trump?s pick for attorney general. Trump advisers are also skeptical of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) an   program to send astronauts to visit an asteroid by the 2020s and test technology that could be beneficial for a Mars trip. The program has lackluster support among scientists and even less in Congress where Republican lawmakers have tried to block its funding. Last month Texas congressman Lamar Smith chairman of the House committee on science space and technology and an early Trump ally asked NASA to show lawmakers the merits of ARM. If Trump wanted the program gone he wouldn?t have to try too hard. Smith supports other   missions like sending spacecraft to search for signs of life in the subsurface ocean of Europa Jupiter?s icy moon. There is one   policy that Trump could preserve ?  and even expand. Each year Obama has requested from Congress more funds for NASA?s commercial spaceflight program which invests in private companies designing launch systems. Trump?s advisers have described such   partnerships as the ?foundation? for   efforts. Trump recently named Elon Musk the CEO of SpaceX to an economic advisory team and has met with Jeff Bezos the founder of spaceflight company Blue Origin despite their contentious relationship over The Washington Post. Some programs could be tougher to amend than others. NASA has been on a very public trajectory to Mars for nearly seven years ?  and Congress in an unusual show of bipartisanship wants to keep it that way. Earlier this month the Senate unanimously passed legislation that amends current law by adding human exploration of Mars to one of NASA?s objectives. The bill ?  which is not expected to become law this year but could come up again in the next Congress ?  is intended to make it politically difficult for future administrations to drastically alter NASA?s plans to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s. The legislation is sponsored by Republican Senator Ted Cruz a supporter of   exploration. The bill wouldn?t stop Trump if he wanted to from switching NASA?s main goal to a return to the moon first before Mars ?  a move that would likely be welcomed by his adviser Newt Gingrich a   advocate. It would mark a radical shift in NASA?s mission but such change wouldn?t be unprecedented. In 2008 presidential candidate Barack Obama said NASA had ?lost focus. ? When he entered office he quickly canceled the Constellation program created under George W. Bush to return humans to the moon by 2020. When Trump takes office some programs could disappear like Constellation did. Like Bolden said last month it?d be crazy to think anything survives a transition.
441,73282,The Mysterious Physics of Rainbows ,Atlantic,Jon Butterworth,1/3/2017,2017,1,,This summer I went on a family holiday to Cornwall on the Helford River. The peninsula south of the river is rather wonderfully called The Lizard. Standing on its cliffs you are at the southernmost point of mainland Britain. North of the river is the port of Falmouth from where   kept the mail services of the British Empire running until 1851. The area is lush with the sort of   beauty that England does so well and the boundary with the contrasting wildness of the Atlantic is never far away. Walking home from a riverside pub one evening I witnessed a stirring natural display. With the sun setting at our backs a fantastically bright and complete double rainbow framed the   leading out to the sea. I have always loved rainbows and this was the best one I have seen. It even came in front of the horizon past the trees on the riverbank opposite and merged with its reflection in the river. It was an invitation and a dare to scientific understanding. The image hovering in front of me was formed by sunlight streaming from behind us internally reflected back towards us by myriad tiny suspended raindrops. When light meets an interface between air and water ?  the surface of a raindrop ?  some of it is reflected and some of it passes through. The angle of refraction depends both on the light?s wavelength and on the angle at which it hits the surface. Parallel rays entering a spherical raindrop bounce off the inside and come back towards us. The reflection angle from the back of the raindrop combined with the two refractions (one as it enters the drop and one as it leaves) conspire to concentrate each wavelength of light at a certain return angle. Wavelength corresponds to color so the colors separate into the familiar bands. That is really all the physics you need to understand the basics of a rainbow. The first rainbow calculations were carried out by Ren Descartes back in 1637 although the dependence on wavelength and hence the colors needed Isaac Newton and Thomas Young?s later contributions. Although I already knew this history in principle it was fresh in my mind because of a lovely review article by Alexander Haussmann of the Technical University in Dresden that I?d come across the same week. Haussmann?s review is full of both science and charm and unlike John Keats?s poor Lamia the rainbow unwoven shines brighter for it. One thing adding to my wonder at the Cornwall rainbow was my realization that the reflection I could see in the river was despite appearances not a reflection of the rainbow in the sky. A true reflection happens when light from the same object but at a different angle reaches the eye after bouncing off a surface. For instance the clouds I could see mirrored in the surface of the river were true reflections. But a rainbow is made up from light reflected internally in raindrops and emitted at a specific angle that is why we see the bow at all. It is not possible for the mirror image to be made from light reflected from the same drops because it would have to have been emitted at a different angle in order to get to our eye. Instead the mirror image comes from light from drops at a different position in the sky radiated at the same angle. Local changes in the rain shower can affect the mirror rainbow completely differently from the   rainbow. There was more to that ?reflection? rainbow than met the eye and there is more to a rainbow than the basic physics explanation too. As the theory of rainbows has developed over history more odd or unusual features were explained. Not only was the separation of colors understood but so was the presence of secondary rainbows that display their colors in the opposite order these are caused by a double internal reflection within the raindrops. There is a darker band between the primary and secondary rainbows known as ?Alexander?s dark band? after Alexander of Aphrodisias who observed it around 200 C. E. Alexander?s dark band lies at an angle forbidden by the optics of the simplest paths the light rays can travel along making it darker than the rest of the sky. There are also rare ?supernumerary arcs? that can appear within the arc of the main bow caused by interference between two light rays coming to the eye at the same angle but traveling slightly different distances. All these features have been understood by developing Descartes?s original theory. The assumptions and approximations he made have been examined and refined aided in recent years by increased computing power. Step by step the details change and become more faithful to real life. You might think there is nothing left to learn about something so simple as a rainbow but no ?  the process continues and has even picked up pace as the ubiquity of   digital cameras has yielded more and better images of startling unusual rainbow features. One recent example is a newfound appreciation of the importance of different drop sizes and shapes. The original theory of rainbows assumes perfectly spherical raindrops and does not depend on the size of the drops. In reality larger raindrops are squished flatter on the underside by air resistance as they fall developing a shape that rainbow enthusiasts call the ?hamburger bun. ? Large drops usually make up a small fraction of a rain shower but when they do contribute calculations show that their oblateness leads to a change in the position of the top of the rainbow while leaving the base unaffected. This is why the base of a rainbow often appears brighter than the top of the bow: all drop sizes contribute at the base whereas near the top light from the large   drops is dispersed. Using precise numerical calculations performed on   computers coded to describe the full scope of Maxwell?s equations of electromagnetism increasingly esoteric features can be understood and omissions and approximations in the theory can be fixed. That?s the way with science whether we are talking about rainbows or   particle collisions. Finding a flaw doesn?t mean the theory is worthless but it does mean that the theory can be improved. Scientists must avoid falling into the trap of defending all aspects of current thought because we feel the underlying truth needs protecting. Details of theory or even broader aspects can often be improved. Doing so strengthens the core of the theory ?  that is if it is fundamentally correct. If it isn?t then we need a better theory as soon as possible. The most effective way to find a deeper description of nature is to seek more observations and to push the existing conception to breaking point. All of those thoughts were hovering along with the rainbow over the Helford River. Our understanding of rainbows is very robust now but not complete. There are undoubtedly details that can still be improved. That walk home along the river however was definitely perfect. This article appears courtesy of Aeon Magazine. 
442,73283,Trump Supporters on What Would Change Their Minds,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Last week I explained how the Trump administration could exceed my expectations and asked Donald Trump supporters to lay down their own markers. What would it take for them to change their minds and stop supporting the president? The first batch of responses included two emails that stood out as particularly useful. Together they illustrate political challenges that Trump will face as he tries to hold on to the very different sorts of supporters who form his coalition. Brendan an immigration hawk from Colorado represents one part of Trump?s base: I am a first time voter 19 and Trump would have to back down on his campaign promises for me to not support him. I am already a bit nervous about some of his cabinet appointments such as the Goldman Sachs bankers and the establishment neoconservatives like John Bolton he has chosen. I feel like the wall and his strong   immigration stance are his signature policy proposals and he would have to cave to pressure from establishment   Republicans and betray his immigration policies he laid out in his AZ speech. His   policies and ideas are very important to my family and I as well. Finally and perhaps most importantly he has to appoint conservative   SCOTUS judges. Really for me it comes down to the immigration trade and SCOTUS issues. If he betrays any of those or otherwise starts acting like another Bush or like Marco Rubio or John McCain or Lindsey Graham I?ll feel betrayed. Trump can tweet as much as he wants though   ?     to me it?s hilarious even if not exactly presidential. You probably think the things I support about Trump are the worst things about him but that?s exactly why most of my conservative family and I support him (I?m not popular in college). Since Reagan (and not even Reagan to be honest) we haven?t had a GOP President actually follow through with    ideas that the base actually wants. The GOP base and myself never wanted ?immigration reform? we wanted less immigration and not a hint of amnesty. We?ve never been for unlimited free trade but for some reason politicians have always considered it sacred.  I don?t want compromise anymore I want to win! Anyways I just wanted to say what I think Trump?s core supporters from the very beginning will want Trump to do   ?     it probably isn?t what the ?moderates? RINOs and liberals want   ?     sorry. Among other things Brendan?s email is a reminder that   fault lines remain with us. (He?s mistaken though to say that Trump has named Bolton to a position in his administration.) Yes Trump prevailed over Jeb Bush Marco Rubio Ted Cruz John Kasich and Lindsey Graham in primaries. At the same time he lost the popular vote and enters office with a historically low approval rating while those rivals are or were popular elected officials in Florida Texas Ohio and South Carolina. Figures like them are sprinkled throughout the Republican Senate. (John McCain is 80 and just won a   term. Surely Trump can?t threaten him.) Insofar as the    agenda and the agenda preferred by Trump?s base are irreconcilable conflict is likely. Trump can probably finesse differences on judges. Immigration and   disagreements will prove harder to resolve. And Trump?s challenge is complicated by another sort of voter in his coalition represented in the next reader email. Its author is Mike who qualifies as a moderate. Mike began by explaining why he voted Trump: He believes that the press was going out of its way to prevent Trump from being elected that the women accusing him of sexual assault were lying to stop his candidacy and that Trump was falsely portrayed as racist. ?He used to make all kinds of contributions to Al Sharpton?s charity which went towards the African American community? he wrote.  ?He use to pal around with Jesse Jackson. He?s friends with Don King  Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson. .. Surprisingly enough he voted for Obama in 2008 when he was a liberal or democrat and made contributions to Hillary Clintons campaign. ? Mike voted for Barack Obama in  2008. In 2016 Mike was a Bernie Sanders supporter ?but since the DNC and the Clinton campaign screwed Bernie I couldn?t vote for him? he explained adding that what he saw as ?dirty political tactics? by Clinton and the media cemented his vote. ?I don?t think Trump is a Republican? he said ?I think he is more liberal then people believe. I also think he wants to avoid a war with Russia which is good. ? In fact Mike?s account of what would make him stop supporting Trump includes a whole lot of policies that many Republican members of Congress would love to see enacted: What would make me change my mind about Trump? That would be a big no for me. ( I don?t worry about Obamacare the truly needy have state run Medicaid programs  however I have nothing against it either. I hope he changes what is bad about it and keeps what is good like he has discussed.) This sort of Trump supporter is familiar to any reporter who wandered America conversing with voters but a lot of people in blue enclaves can hardly conceive that they exist. Mike concluded: My main worries are for Social Security the disabled elderly and people in our country that are vulnerable and require some kind of government assistance. If he does anything that really impacts this group of people that would definitely be enough for me to vote against Trump in 2020 . I want to give him a chance let?s see what he does in these 4 years . He could really surprise everyone. I think Trump is better then getting Ted Cruz who is actually a radical Republican conservative. Whereas Trump has a lot of   ideas. Trump was the only Republican I voted for this election. The rest of my votes went to state Democrats.  I am a bit concerned that he has a Republican House and Senate which makes it a lot easier for Republicans to push some radical conservative agenda through. And Trump may be pressured to help them with that since he ran under their party. The Supreme Court picks will have me a bit concerned. I think Trump is more   and he is surrounded by a lot of radical conservatives even some he has chosen in his cabinet picks. Hopefully he sticks to the positive change that he talked about and doesn?t let these Republicans dictate his presidency. If I see some far right agenda being pushed I will definitely vote the other way next time around . Holding on to Brendan or Mike four years from now poses tough challenges for President Trump. Holding onto both sorts of voters without losing large swaths of the conservative movement would require extraordinary political finesse. How Trump attempts to keep his coalition together may determine his 2020 primary challenger. Current Trump supporters with their own ideas about what would change their minds are still encouraged to email conor@theatlantic. com especially if your views depart from those of Brendan and Mike. I thank them for the time and effort it took to write.
443,73284,How University Costs Keep Rising Despite Tuition Freezes,Atlantic,Jon Marcus ,1/3/2017,2017,1,,DAYTON Ohio ?  At a time when public anger is   on tuition charges that are rising three times faster than inflation something less well understood has actually been largely responsible for pushing up the cost of college: fees. Think tuition is high? Now add fees for student activities fees for athletics fees for building maintenance fees for libraries ?  even fees for graduation the bills for which often arrive just as students and their families thought they were finally done paying for their higher education. All are frustratingly piled on top of a long list of expenses beyond tuition that many people never plan for or expect or that can?t be covered by financial aid ?  sometimes forcing them to take out more and more loans or quit college altogether.  ?It was like what is this?? Ann Roach remembered thinking as she kept getting billed for fees when her oldest son went to the University of Dayton. ?It?s like buying a car. You think you have a price and then they tell you ?Here?s a conveyance fee or here?s a fee for $200 to put the license plates on.? Nobody told us about these. ? Fees nationwide continue to increase even faster than tuition ?  often covering the same things but letting institutions claim tuition hikes are slowing. Now however in response to anger from parents and students and pressure from legislatures or for marketing reasons in a time when they?re struggling to attract applicants a few universities and colleges are pledging to make them more predictable or even drop them altogether. And the resulting decline in borrowing and dropout rates on those campuses suggest the significant toll that fees were taking on their students. Since the time that Roach?s son went to Dayton for instance ?  he graduated in 2012 to be followed by two younger siblings ?  the school has stopped charging separate fees and rolled them into tuition which it guarantees it won?t increase for the four years an accepted applicant remains enrolled. The university was surprised to find that graduating students in a survey said they were ?feeling  ? said Jason Reinoehl Dayton?s vice president for strategic enrollment management. ?Frankly they were ticked off and they were saying this on the way out of college which should have been a celebratory time. ? That?s because those graduates had been charged $2 100 annually in fees on average in five different bills per year or at least 20 times per student over the course of their four years in college. Those fees included everything from counseling fees to lab fees to   fees to access to the recreation complex to a ?  fee? in the school of business that turned out to pay for a subscription to The Wall Street Journal. ?This was why students were annoyed and we needed to fix it? Reinoehl said. The fees weren?t necessarily lowered but since 2013 they have been included in the tuition charge ($26 590 this year) meaning more of them can be covered by financial aid and all are paid up front. This also encourages the university to hold the line on annual increases which can no longer be partly hidden in fees. ?There are no surprises here? pronounces a message splashed across the binder in which applicants receive information about how much the university will cost them to attend. The first students who were eligible for the program will graduate this spring and the university says they have already had to borrow at least 15 percent less toward their degrees. Dropout rates have also fallen. So has the proportion of admitted applicants who fail to show up for their freshman year in September after getting their first bill. Fees still add up to plenty of surprises for students and their families on other campuses however. One reason is that they?re hard to track. There are few sources of information on how much fees actually cost on average. ?Tuition gets all of the media attention while fees are hidden to students and also to public knowledge and oversight? said Jennifer Delaney an associate professor at the University of Illinois at   who specializes in   finance. Those that are reported tend to be mandatory fees not the growing number of   supplemental fees charged by individual courses or departments such as lab fees and that   fee at the University of Dayton business school. One new study calculates that student fees at   public universities averaged $1 719 in the   school year the most recent for which the figure is available adding another 27 percent to student charges on top of the typical cost of tuition. Fees have also been increasing far faster than tuition nearly doubling at   public universities and more than doubling at community colleges since   according to that study by Robert Kelchen an assistant professor of education at Seton Hall University. ?We?ve all seen the proliferation of these with multiple fees multiple program fees and multiple course fees? said Eric Spina the president of the University of Dayton. Other universities he said tell their students ??Don?t worry about the extra $400.? Well the $400 three years ago was $50. ? Students at public universities in Connecticut New Jersey South Dakota and Virginia were charged $2 500 or more in fees per year and in Massachusetts $8 280 Kelchen reported ?  nearly five times the cost of tuition in that state. Separate research at the University of Missouri found that students nationwide were being charged such things as   fees   fees   and   fees   and   fees bicycle   fees campus   fees ? ? fees   fees safety fees   fees and at one university a ?    fee. ? Athletics fees are particularly contentious. Athletic departments at Division 1 universities and colleges got an average annual subsidy of between $3. 5 million and $4. 2 million per school from student fees in 2011 according to the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. By dividing the athletic fee per student at Ohio University by the number of varsity athletic events the average student reported attending the center found that each student there was paying $130 for each game he or she actually attended. To make things worse fees often increase with each successive year a student is in college in the form of such things as lab or studio fees added to the cost of increasingly advanced courses in many majors. The only way to avoid them by that point is to drop out or transfer risking the loss of academic credits. If some of these fees sound like they?re covering exactly the same things tuition is supposed to ?  the University of Missouri study found at various institutions   fees   and   fees education   fees educational and technology fees educational   fees and   fees ?  they are. Many have been added to make up for state budget cuts to avoid making tuition look like it?s rising too quickly or because legislatures have ordered that tuition be frozen. In Missouri for example where public universities were stopped by law from raising tuition faster than inflation schools instead increased their fees by 138 percent over six years an investigation by the state auditor found. ?But they held the line on tuition? Kelchen said wryly. In Massachusetts public universities had to return their revenue from tuition to the state but got to keep the money they made from fees the result was that tuition didn?t increase but fees skyrocketed. Georgia?s Board of Regents added a $100 ?  fee? in 2009 when state funding was cut near the start of the recession. But while the funding has rebounded the fee remains and has increased to $450. ?It really does seem like a semantic thing that it?s just another word for tuition? Delaney said. One result is that     scholarships might sound as if they cover the whole cost of college but often fall short since they don?t include fees. A merit scholarship for full tuition to public universities in Massachusetts for example left students to come up on their own with what was then nearly $8 000 a year worth of fees a Harvard study found. That further complicates the already difficult struggle to pay for a degree. ?A focus on affordability that doesn?t include predictability is really hard on students and parents? said Delaney. Or as Spina put it universities should ?be right up front and tell our students: This is what you get for this price. ? A resulting backlash has a few institutions making changes and some legislatures ordering them to. After student complaints the University of Kansas has reduced its athletics fee from $50 to $12 a year. The Virginia General Assembly has directed that beginning this year universities there reduce their reliance on student fees to support intercollegiate athletics the legislation specifically limits Old Dominion University to using student fees for 55 percent or less of its athletics budget. Old Dominion students in   paid $1 429 each in athletics fees alone accounting for 65 percent of the athletics budget. The Massachusetts Legislature has approved a change that lets the public universities there hold onto revenue from their own tuition. In response starting next fall the universities will wrap together tuition and most   fees in a single charge on a simplified bill. And at the University of Iowa eight different fees charged by the registrar?s office ?  including transcript fees   fees and fees to add or drop courses ?  were consolidated in the fall into one $225 fee. That?s $25 less than they previously cost separately. But the main reason for the change said the registrar Larry Lockwood was to help students manage their budgets by making sure they knew what charges to expect. ?We had to take control of this? Lockwood said. One of those fees was a $100 graduation charge that Iowa like many universities makes its students pay before they don caps and gowns and walk across the stage to pick up their degrees. ?How would you like to have to pay one more fee just as you?re about to graduate?? Lockwood asked. Among other things the change is expected to save the university money it used to spend chasing after fees. The University of Dayton too says it will end up saving money not only by avoiding having to send out 40 000 separate bills per year for student fees but by not having to go through the costly process of replacing students who quit school because they couldn?t afford to pay the fees. It?s also an important selling point for the private Catholic university which after a brief dip when students and their parents seemed confused about the changes has seen a surge of applications and an increase in enrollment. ?This is very much about building trust? said Dayton?s Reinoehl. ?It?s our beacon. I think the whole industry is going to have to do this. ? He said other schools have called to learn more about the new way the University of Dayton bundles its charges. For now however Reinoehl said in much of the rest of higher education there remains ?a trend to charge more fees not fewer. ? Students on the campus outside his window count themselves among the few American college and university students who live in blissful innocence of that. One Laylah Funk said her friends at other schools ?were blown away when I told them we don?t have to pay for health services or counseling. ? Renee Brown who has two siblings at other colleges said they?re constantly being hit with fees. ?You think you?ve paid for everything and then some fee comes up out of nowhere? Brown said. Studying in a quiet corner of the library on a frigid Ohio morning   major Ryan Berry was asked what it?s like to not have to pay for all of those fees his counterparts at most other colleges and universities face. Berry responded with a quizzical look. ?I didn?t know that was actually a thing? he said. This post appears courtesy of The Hechinger Report.
444,73285,Tweeting Mao?s Cultural Revolution in Real-Time ,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Can we agree on this much? Twitter was terrible in 2016. Too many tweetstorms too many Russian   too much game theory. For the blank slate of 2017 may I suggest you follow the   anniversary of the Cultural Revolution in real time. Fifty years ago this past May Mao Zedong declared the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in 2016 someone had the idea to livetweet that tumultuous period on a   delay. @GPCR50 has about 1 500 followers which is frankly on the low end of modest. But I?ve been one of its avid followers because this was an uncanny year to see the events of the Cultural Revolution swirled together with the 2016 election in my feed. Violence simmered over at Trump rallies. Red Guards attacked their teachers in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping made   in deference to Mao. Newt Gingrich declares ?I made a big boo boo? in suggesting Trump did not plan to drain the swamp. The surreal past met the surreal present. Anyways I don?t want to draw tidy parallels between the Cultural Revolution and America in 2016 because obviously so much does not run parallel. But in a time when voters have shown casual eagerness to blow up a system that isn?t working for them at at time when Trump can ask ?What do you have to lose? ? @GPCR50 was a daily reminder by tweet of just how much we have to lose. We?ve had relative order and stability for so long. Chaos is a foreign country. I confess to being no expert either here. As a kid most of my awareness of the Cultural Revolution came from stories from my parents who were born in China around that time. And like the fairy tales a parent might tell these stories had a kind of unlogic they seemed no more real to me than a fairy tale. A man for example rides home with a portrait of Chairman Mao tied up to the back of his bike. The rope holding the portrait in place just happens to go across Mao?s neck. This is a sign of disloyalty. He is mobbed and killed. What the hell? Yet @GPCR was a constant stream of   violence. Mao directed the Red Guards which grew out of   students in Beijing to attack the ?Four Olds? ?  old customs old culture old habits and old ideas. In effect this meant the destruction of books museums temples and shrines as well as the people who stood for them.   students turned on their teachers and killed them.    Middle school Red Guards beat Vice Principal Bian Zhongyun with   clubs. She passes out and is dumped in a rubbish cart.    Daxing?s local brigade buries undesirables alive. ?Granny I?m getting sand in my eyes? says a girl aged 8. ?Soon you won?t feel it?.    Red Guards resort to using dynamite to open Confucius? tomb. But when they peer into the crater nothing discernibly human is left. And for a certain period in August the @GPCR50 was just death count:    Red Guards killed 200 people in Beijing today.    Red Guards killed 224 people in Beijing today. The man behind @GPCR50 is Jacob Saxton of Southampon U. K. whom I phoned one recent afternoon to talk about his Twitter creation. Saxton is a not a historian ?  he is a logistics analyst by day ?  but he has an interest in modern Chinese history and was reading Mao?s Last Revolution last year. He noticed the 50 years that passed and no one else was chronicling the period. So he decided to. The one book soon grew to a stack and Saxton now plans out tweets month by month in a ?sort of slightly shoddy Excel spreadsheet. ? In August when the   violence was reaching its peak he had to take a few days off work to catch up on the tweets. ?It?s a lot more time than I realized at the beginning? he says. Some of the tweets can admittedly be a bit abstruse if you are not already familiar with the cast of characters. But the best tweets capture some small measure of humanity. One of Saxton?s favorite stories involves a fruit basket which he actually didn?t get to tweet in real time because he read about it too late. (A hazard of his   process.) I?ll let him tell it himself now: Right at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution Mao got rid of Peng Zhen who was the mayor of Beijing.  He was quite close to Liu Shaoqi the president. Liu went out on a big foreign trip during the time when the purge of Peng Zhen was happening and he was so in the dark about this ?  the way Peng had gone from the mayor of Beijing this really important guy to pariah ?  he came back with a beautiful fruit basket for Peng. Only on the last leg of the journey did he found out how much things have changed. It?s quite a funny image to imagine him trying to hide this fruit basket. In tweeting out these events in real time Saxton has also gotten to experience them in real time. ?I thought the saddest bit were the way you could see this violence creeping towards people ?  people who you might read about having died on a certain day in the Cultural Revolution? he says. ?But then you look more into it there are weeks of it gradually ramping up and the attacks get more physical and their own mental state chipped away. ? When Saxton began the Twitter account he had no idea that it would be such a tumultuous year for politics in his country the U. K. let alone the U. S. He is wary of drawing close parallels too but he says it struck him how long it took China?s political elite to realize how bad the Cultural Revolution would get.   It can get worse. The Cultural Revolution officially ends in 1976. For now Saxon says he?s committed to tweeting the whole thing.
445,73286,Why Trump?s Conflicts of Interest Matter,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,1/3/2017,2017,1,,  Donald Trump has announced he?s closing his foundation but that doesn?t put an end to the tangle of potential conflicts of interest he will drag with him into the oval office. To name just a few examples Trump runs a vineyard that awaits   visas ?  documents doled out by a department he will soon oversee. He is currently trying to build a   office building in Buenos Aires something the journalist Jorge Lanata said Trump discussed with Argentine president Mauricio Macri during his first phone call with him as  . (Both Macri and Trump have denied this discussion.) Trump even told the New York Times in late November that his ?brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. ? Trump?s complicated network of business ties worry ethics watchdogs who say it should not even be possible for an American president to be swayed by the prospect of personal riches. ?He might decide to go softly on a foreign government because he knows he has assets there? said Lisa Gilbert director of the Congress Watch division at Public Citizen. ?He can?t even have that in the back of his mind. The American economy has to outweigh any personal financial benefits. ? Trump meanwhile has maintained that he won?t be bothered by the conflicts telling the Times first that ?the president can?t have a conflict of interest? then that ?the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants. ? ?In theory? he suggested to the paper?s writers and editors ?I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. ? The reason critics doubt Trump?s assertion ?  that he?s somehow above the lure of profit ?  is that years of research show even small kickbacks can change   individuals? behavior. We know this from studies on another group of wealthy confident individuals who must daily grapple with both moral and economic matters: Doctors. Studies have repeatedly shown that receiving gifts or money from a pharmaceutical company makes doctors biased toward that company. A comprehensive review in 2010 found that exposure to information from pharmaceutical companies almost always influenced doctors to increase their prescribing of the drugs the companies were promoting even when those drugs were less appropriate for the patient. In a study published this month in the journal Social Science  Medicine Yale professor Marissa King found that in states that banned gifts to doctors from pharmaceutical companies doctors were less likely to prescribe costly new medications that had few advantages over cheaper generic alternatives. ?Pharmaceutical representatives are likable people and we like doing things to please people that we like? says Peter Mansfield an Australian physician who founded the   group HealthySkepticism. org and   the 2010 review paper. Partly in response to findings like these some states and organizations have cracked down on pharmaceutical swag in recent years. Still doctors aren?t free of conflicts of interest since drug companies still fund continuing medical education programs and seek out consulting relationships with physicians according to Genevieve   a senior fellow researching conflicts of interest at the University of Pennsylvania. Even cheap gifts can create a feeling of indebtedness playing into our human desire to reciprocate. Branded pens or tchotchkes ?make the brand name more easily retrievable from memory and cognitively ease the path for doctors to prescribe more of that particular brand?   said. Medical students given a Lipitor clipboard were more likely to prefer it over a generic cholesterol drug. As Mansfield explains ?if you do something after getting a big gift you can tell yourself you did that because of the gift. If you did something because of a small gift your understanding is that you did it because you believed the person. ? Trump?s assertion that he will be able to separate his personal interest from the greater good is also not uncommon ?  and generally false. ?People have a ?bias blind spot?? says King the Yale professor ?and are more likely to see bias in others than in themselves. ? In a 1992 study doctors were treated to   trips to seminars held at luxury resorts on the West Coast Florida and the Caribbean by makers of an antibiotic and heart drug. When interviewed by the study authors almost all the doctors said there?s no way they would be influenced by the vacations. But the doctors? use of both drugs shot up after they returned home. Similarly medical residents were much more likely to think other doctors are influenced by swag and   lunches than they themselves would be. ?We pick up an infection of bias? Mansfield said but ?we get offended if someone says we might be carrying a bias. ? In fact people who are more confident about their ability to resist influence tend to make decisions more quickly Mansfield said and that process ?can be influenced by gifts and other triggers for    . ? So will Trump fall into the same trap that doctors have?   believes he might since unlike physicians politicians have no board certification or formal professional guild that governs their ethical code. ?On the other hand politicians may very well become inured to or savvy about attempts to influence them and therefore be less amenable to influence? she added. But Mansfield thinks Trump?s no different from a psychiatrist scribbling with a Vyvanse pen. ?To the extent that Trump is human he?ll be influenced by conflicts of interest? Mansfield said. ?Perhaps even more so if he sees them as being small and if he?s genuinely confident he won?t be influenced. ? Trump has previously said he would put his children in charge of his businesses but that would hardly a true blind trust since his children would likely discuss the businesses with their father. (So far they?ve been some of his closest advisers.) Ideally in Public Citizens? view Trump?s assets would be placed in the hands of impartial overseers who would sell them off one by one. Trump has so far postponed a press conference at which he was expected to announce how he would handle his conflicts of interest. If he doesn?t divest even if he does manage to build a mental wall between his personal interests and those of the nation the public will have no way of knowing. And as Gilbert sees it that might be a problem in itself. As president she says ?you should be free of the whisper of impropriety. It?s not that it might enrich him it?s that people will think that it could. It?s an appearance of corruption that we?ve been above as the United States. ? Time will tell if the U. S. will continue to be an exception to that rule.
446,73287,A Long-Lost Data Trove Uncovers California?s Sterilization Program,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,1/3/2017,2017,1,,In 2007 only after historian Alexandra Minna Stern had spent years researching eugenics in the American west culminating in a published book did she find the motherlode. During the height of the eugenics movement California sterilized 20 000 patients deemed   or insane. Stern who is a professor at the University of Michigan wrote about the sterilization program in her book but she had only a patchwork of records to work with. One day in 2007 a secretary pointed her toward a neglected filing cabinet at the state department of mental health?s office in Sacramento. Inside were 19 reels of coiled microfilm containing sterilization recommendation forms with the names ages family histories and diagnoses of nearly 20 000 patients. These forgotten records covered patients recommended for sterilization at California state hospitals from 1919 to 1952. ?The microfilm was in very good shape? says Stern. ?I don?t think anyone had looked at it since the 70s. ? Recognizing the value of such a complete record Stern had the microfilm duplicated. (Good thing because the original microfilm was later lost when the department reorganized following California?s budget cuts.) From there the project morphed into something resembling contemporary data science more than traditional historical research. Stern hired a team of students to turn microfilm into a searchable database of health records ?  powered by   clinical trial software. And along the way the team encountered the promises and pitfalls of big data as applied to history. Recently Stern   a paper estimating that as many as 831 of the patients sterilized are still alive. The paper she hopes will spark conversations about compensating those forcibly sterilized like North Carolina and Virginia have done. Until now such a conversation had not happened in California. Because to compensate people you have to first know who they are. * * * California became the third state to pass a sterilization law in 1909. The law allowed superintendents at state psychiatric institutions to sterilize patients to improve their ?physical mental or moral condition. ? The wording was vague and it could be applied to patients considered mentally ill handicapped sexually deviant criminal ?  anyone considered a misfit really. Sterilization would prevent these undesirable people from having children. As a kid growing up in California Stern recalls these state institutions being evoked in schoolyard taunts ?  like ?Oh you?re weird you?ll end up in Napa? referring to Napa State Hospital. The institutions performed vasectomies on men and salpingectomies or the removal of Fallopian tubes in women. The 20 000 people sterilized in California account for   of all such sterilizations in the U. S. Here are some of their stories as previously written by Stern: In 1943 a      boy we will call Roberto was committed to the Sonoma State Home an institution for the ?feebleminded? in Northern California. Roberto?s journey to Sonoma began the previous year when he was picked up by the Santa Barbara Police for a string of infractions that included intoxication a knife fight and involvement with a ?local gang of marauding Mexicans. ? Citing his record of delinquency and ?borderline? IQ score of 75 the officials at Sonoma recommended that Roberto be sterilized. Roberto?s father adamantly and unsuccessfully opposed his son?s sterilization and went so far as to secure a priest to protest the operation. Or the story of a young   woman: Silvia a   mother of a toddler was 20 years old when she was placed in Pacific Colony in 1950. She was assessed with an ?imbecile? IQ of 35 and reportedly had been raised in a violent home. Silvia?s mother ostensibly could not control her daughter and approved her sterilization. Or that of a young possibly gay man: Fifteen years earlier Timothy a white   old placed in Stockton because of   encounters since boyhood and a psychiatric diagnosis of ?dementia praecox hebephrenic type? consented to his own reproductive surgery perhaps because he knew that it was a potential ticket out of the facility or because he felt it would help him control his pathologized sexual desires. These are individual stories but Stern wanted to construct the database to find larger patterns. And of the foremost questions she wanted to ask was whether Hispanic patients were treated any differently in these institutions. The first step just building a database was no trivial task. The 20 000 records each contained 212 individual variables. ?Imagine you put all that in Excel spreadsheet. It?s going to be a mind boggling mess? says Stern. Since they were working with health records they also needed to be in compliance with HIPAA. Stern?s then graduate student Natalie Lira now a professor of   studies at the University of Illinois   headed up that effort. She ended up collaborating with   from University of Michigan?s School of Public Health to use Redcap a data capture tool typical in clinical trials. Over three years a team of undergraduate and graduate students entered the data off of the microfilm into a searchable database. Asking the question of who is Hispanic turned out to be complicated too. The forms did not have a line for ethnicity instead they asked for ?nativity? where someone was originally born. A man of Mexican descent could be born in California so nativity would not correlate with what we currently think of as Hispanic. When Nicole Novak an epidemiologist who also worked on the project went to look for census data on Hispanics living in California she encountered more confusion. Mexicans for example where considered their own race in 1930 white in 1940 and after though states in the Southwest had their own category for ?white person of Spanish surname. ? Looking at historic records says Novak ?has shed a lot of light on how constructed a lot of categories we use in public health are. ? The team ended up using Spanish surnames as a proxy for Hispanic ethnicity despite the imperfect correlation. (Filipinos for example also have Spanish surnames.) Eventually they found that patients with Spanish surnames were indeed     times as likely to be sterilized than those without. The ?nativity? classification posed another question. Should the team use the original outdated terminology on the forms or attempt to update them to our modern language? ?Do you use ?dementia praecox? which is roughly equivalent to schizophrenia today? Do you use the word ?Negro? ?? says Stern. In the end they ended up using the original terms. As a historian Stern is very much aware of the pitfalls of using interpreting the past through a modern lens. ?One can be seduced by big data? she says. ? You have to precede with caution. ? To use this database is to interpret variables set a century ago. These issues are on Stern?s mind now because the team is working to make the database available to other researchers. It also requires a delicate balance of privacy. Many of the records are now old enough that they are publicly available in California?s state archives in Sacramento. (The microfilm is the state archives is actually the duplicate set Stern made because remember the originals were lost.) But is that the same thing as putting them online for anyone to search? Especially if hundreds of these patients as the recent paper suggests are still alive? Stern?s team too has had to balance their desires to learn more with the wishes of the people whose lives they are studying. The records are wealth of intimate information. And despite analyzing the data on a macro level ?  831 survivors is a statistical estimate based on age ?  they haven?t gone looking for them individually. As a researcher says Lira ?Ethically it feels wrong to look at someone?s medical records and try to reach out and contact them. ? Stern says she has heard from family members of sterilized patients who reached out after learning about her research. In one case she also managed to track down the sister of a woman who had been sterilized and later filed a lawsuit. The sister called Stern back but said she didn?t want to talk anymore because the past was too painful. Ideally says Stern the state of California would take on the task of finding these patients and compensating them. ?It?s more present in my mind now that there?s a story for every single data point? says Novak who as an epidemiologists usually works with statistics. That filing cabinet in Sacramento held 20 000 forgotten stories now with 20 000 names to go with them.
447,73288,The GOP?s Ethics Disaster,Atlantic,Norm Ornstein,1/3/2017,2017,1,,I have rarely been more angry or dismayed at the conduct of Congress than I was Monday night with the unconscionable deplorable underhanded move by Representative Bob Goodlatte to eviscerate and undermine the Office of Congressional Ethics. When House Speaker Paul Ryan and his counterpart Nancy Pelosi indicated weeks ago that they would continue OCE the reform community ?  left and right ?  breathed a sigh of relief. Ryan like his predecessor John Boehner had seen the value to the integrity of the House of the office which has been a stalwart of bipartisan and nonpartisan comity and independence. That makes this    action even more outrageous. In March 2008 the House of Representatives did something striking stirring unprecedented and edifying. It voted to create for the first time an independent office to deal with congressional ethics. I was both exultant and relieved at the time. I had seen up close for decades the difficulty inherent in a body tasked with policing itself. It is built into the Constitution that each house of Congress judge the conduct of its individual members. But the way in which this happened in practice via a Committee on Standards of Official Conduct had rarely worked either to make standards crystal clear to members and staff or to inspire public confidence in the body. For more than two decades I had pushed to create an independent office with involvement from former members who understand the nature of ethics in a political body to be the first step in judging the conduct of members. The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In The problem was built into the system. Having members of a political and partisan body pass judgment on their colleagues has inherent conflicts. Fail to act when wrongdoing is apparent? The   network is protecting its own proving the corruption of politics.  Take tough action or bring controversial charges? That can reflect partisan motives or revenge or the ambitions of members of the ethics panel taking out rivals for power. Clouds of suspicion hang over the process. Those conflicts are true in the best of times even when the members of the ethics panel act together in good faith skepticism is inevitable. But the years leading up to 2008 were anything but the best of times. First came the ethics wars led by Newt Gingrich in the years leading up to 1994 using the ethics process for partisan leverage criminalizing policy differences. After Gingrich became speaker the backlash hit him directly in a tit for tat. Under Speaker Dennis Hastert and his henchman Tom DeLay it got worse. The nadir came in 2004 when an honest ethics panel chaired by conservative Republican Joel Hefley of Colorado did its duty and recommended sanctions against DeLay for unethical conduct. Hastert responded by firing Hefley and removing two standup Republican members Kenny Hulshof of Missouri and the late Steve LaTourette of Ohio. When Democrats recaptured the House in 2006 the new speaker Nancy Pelosi began a process to clean the House choosing Massachusetts Democrat Michael Capuano to lead the effort via a bipartisan select panel.  Through a lengthy arduous process with deep opposition from nearly all Republicans and real reluctance on the part of many Democrats Capuano working closely with me and Tom Mann and a small group of other reformers pieced together a balanced plan that respected and preserved the constitutional requirement that the House be the judge of its own members kept intact the ethics committee but created a way to build larger credibility that the ethics process would be honest and fair whatever the political currents or partisan pressures. It was weaker than we had hoped ?  it had no subpoena power even indirectly via the ethics committee ?  but it was still a major breakthrough. The OCE would never have made it over the finish line if it were not for Pelosi (and the respect Capuano had among his colleagues.) But while it passed on a   line vote it would have been neutered quickly if it were not for the willingness of Republican Leader John Boehner to pick strong members for the first office.  It was the initial cast of members who kept OCE on course despite opposition from the members of the ethics committee and the wariness of a large group of lawmakers. David Skaggs and Porter Goss were the first leaders and were exemplary as were their colleagues including other former members (Bill Frenzel and Ab Mikva may they rest in peace along with Yvonne Burke and Karan English and two others who had deep experience around Congress Jay Eagan and Allison Hayward. The OCE members spanned the political spectrum and had a thankless task but responded just the way we had hoped ?  every decision they made was balanced careful and importantly unanimous. The body took plenty of potshots from aggrieved members of both parties which have continued since its creation.  Reformers have feared at the beginning of each Congress since then that the leadership would try to remove it or weaken it. But Pelosi stood firm and Boehner to his great credit did so as well. Now this. Rules packages get up or down votes and are top priority for the majority leadership. They are not rejected by the majority party. The package is put together by the leadership nothing gets included or excluded without the   of the speaker. Make no mistake about it: Despite public reports loudly proclaiming his opposition it?s hard to believe this would have happened had Paul Ryan really tried to stop it. And do not believe Goodlatte?s risable assurance that this strengthens OCE. It has been muzzled and hamstrung defenestrated and castrated. If Speaker Ryan really is opposed he can demand a separate vote on the OCE provision when the whole House votes on its rules. If he does not he owns it plain and simple. Given Ryan?s solidarity with   Trump on Russian hacking ?  preceded by his   any bipartisan statement during the campaign warning against foreign attempts to influence our elections ?  along with Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz?s indifference to any investigation of conflicts of interest or ethical problems with the   and his cronies this is chilling evidence that we are headed for a new age of official embrace or at least acceptance of unethical and illegal behavior. The core of America?s political system depends on real checks and balances on a Congress that puts country ahead of party. The House leadership showed this week that party comes first. 
448,73289,A President Without an Administration,Atlantic,Russell Berman,1/3/2017,2017,1,,  Donald Trump will take the reins of the federal government on January 20. How many people he will have by his side on that date is very much in question. The Trump transition is substantially behind the pace set eight years ago by Barack Obama?s team and a late start to vetting Cabinet nominees for security clearances and financial conflicts of interest threatens to leave many senior posts vacant when Trump assumes the presidency in just     weeks. The delays which were described by people familiar with the transition as well as several congressional aides could hamper the new president?s ability to deliver the swift change he has promised in Washington. In the weeks after the election Trump made a show of naming members of his Cabinet in rapid succession giving the impression that his transition was proceeding speedily faster even than many people expected after such a shocking result on November 8. But the slew of nominations obscured an important detail: Trump?s team had done little or no vetting of those appointees before or immediately after the election as the Obama transition had done. Potential picks were rarely asked to submit information for a standard FBI background check or financial documents needed for disclosure requirements and an ethics agreement. That meant that a process that takes weeks or even months did not begin until late November or December in some cases. The Donald Trump Cabinet Tracker And for Trump there?s another complication: His Cabinet is stacked with wealthy executives whose vast and complex financial portfolios must be combed for potential business conflicts and then untangled before they receive Senate confirmation hearings. They include Rex Tillerson the Exxon Mobil CEO nominated to be secretary of state Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary Andrew Puzder for labor secretary Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary and Betsy DeVos as education secretary. ?With these billionaires it?s going to take a lot more time? said Richard Painter who served as the chief ethics lawyer in the Bush White House from 2005 to 2007. Painter recalled that when he joined the government 12 years ago it took him half a day to fill out the initial financial disclosure form. ?But? he said ?I was just a law professor.  I have mutual funds. I don?t even own any individual stocks and it?s really a pretty boring report. ? By comparison when Painter helped shepherd Hank Paulson to confirmation as treasury secretary in 2006 it took the Goldman Sachs CEO and a team of pricey outside lawyers     weeks to complete the same form. The task of vetting and then preparing ethics agreements for Trump?s nominees now falls to the Office of Government Ethics a relatively small federal agency with about 80 employees and an annual budget of $16 million. The office reviews each nominee?s financial disclosure report for potential conflicts of interest and then instructs them what assets they must unload among other steps they may have to take to comply with the law once they take office. The result is a signed agreement that is sent to the Senate and posted publicly. Tillerson for example is expected to have to divest himself completely from Exxon Mobil including forgoing any stock options to which he may be entitled. While the office has been preparing for the presidential transition for months it is likely to struggle to complete work for Trump?s Cabinet in time for them all to be in place by inauguration. ?It?s a huge challenge for the office. Huge challenge? Painter said. ?They need more funding. ? (The OGE despite a   flurry of tweets directed at Trump does not comment on individual reports which are made public only when they are complete.) By this time eight years ago several of Obama?s Cabinet picks had signed ethics agreements said Norman Eisen a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as the president?s ethics lawyer during the transition and his first years in the White House. None of Trump?s nominees have them yet. ?They are behind? Eisen said. With a   Democratic majority in 2009 the Senate confirmed six members of Obama?s Cabinet on the day he was inaugurated and another four within the next week. Republicans control the chamber now and they want to have a similar number of Trump nominees in place when he takes office. Democrats however are worried that Republican leaders will try to rush through several nominees whose thin public record and thicket of potential financial entanglements deserve more time for scrutiny. Last month the senior Democrats on 16 Senate committees demanded that no Trump nominee should receive a confirmation hearing until he or she has cleared an FBI background check submitted a signed ethics agreement and answered   questions from committee members. Because of a rules change engineered by Democrats in 2013 the 52 Senate Republicans can confirm Trump?s nominees without Democratic votes and a few committee chairmen have already set tentative hearing dates for the second and third week of January without receiving the completed paperwork for the nominees. ?There is no indication that the schedule for hearings is going to be ticked back as a result of this slower pace? a senior Senate Democratic aide said. While Democrats can?t block the nominees outright without GOP defections they can use parliamentary tactics to slow down the process and turn the Senate into even more of a bottleneck than it already is. In some cases they could delay confirmation hearings for nominees or they could force the Senate to spend days debating each candidate on the floor ?  a move that would not only keep top Cabinet offices vacant but prevent Republicans from moving quickly to passage of Trump?s legislative agenda. Senator Charles Schumer of New York the new Democratic leader warned that his members would ?vehemently resist? any GOP effort to rush Cabinet nominees into office without proper hearings or before their financial disclosure and ethics agreements were complete. ?If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process they?re sorely mistaken? Schumer said in a statement. The other fear among some Democrats in and out of government is that with the help of a compliant Republican Congress Trump?s Cabinet nominees will simply follow the example of their   boss when it comes to ethics. The   never released his tax returns during the campaign and he has refused to fully divest from his businesses before taking office. Yet while the specifics ethics law that applies to government employees does not apply to the president his appointees would be putting themselves in enormous legal jeopardy if they took office without resolving potential conflicts of interest. ?They commit a criminal offense? Painter said. ?That doesn?t apply to the president and vice president but they commit a criminal offense. The people working for him are going to have to play by the rules. ? Republican chairmen say Democrats are overstating the delays and that they intend to follow Senate precedents in processing nominees which vary by committee. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has rejected demands from Democrats for example that the committee ask Tillerson to provide his tax returns since it has not done so for past nominees. But he said Tillerson would not receive special treatment or exemptions from the traditional requirements. ?Prior to his confirmation hearing he will go through the same ethics and FBI checks as previous Secretary of State nominees? Corker said. ?That has always been the plan it is already in progress and I am deeply disappointed my colleagues continue to imply otherwise. Our committee will carry out exactly the same procedures for Mr. Tillerson?s nomination that have been carried out since well before I joined the committee 10 years ago. ? Similarly Republican spokeswomen for the Senate committees with jurisdiction over the Treasury Labor and Health and Human Services departments said they would not move forward with hearings until the nominees submit their completed paperwork including signed ethics agreements. ?Democrats are creating a red herring here ?  there is no concern that forms will not be filled out? said Margaret Atkinson spokeswoman for the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. * * * Where did things go awry for the Trump transition? Close observers of the process point to his decision made just a few days after the election to replace New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as chairman of his transition committee along with some of the people who had spent months doing the prep work in Washington for a possible Trump administration. The   had by his own admission given little thought to the transition before the election out of a sense of superstition. He and his inner circle took over the operation immediately after November 8 moving the power center from   offices in D. C. to Trump Tower (and his other properties in New Jersey and Florida) where a parade of job seekers has traveled for job interviews. Yet the formal vetting of those candidates has not in most cases begun before Trump selects them for a job. Take the case of Cathy McMorris Rodgers the   Republican congresswoman who was poised to become Trump?s nominee for interior secretary before the   was persuaded to pick Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana instead. Over the course of about 10 days McMorris Rodgers met twice with Trump and had phone calls with Vice   Mike Pence and one of Trump?s sons Donald Jr. according to a Republican familiar with the process. Her name was leaked to the press which reported that she was likely to get the interior job. Yet at no time did Trump officials collect paperwork of any kind from McMorris Rodgers. ?We were not asked for anything at all ever? this Republican said. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on their vetting operation. Several people familiar with the transition process said McMorris Rodgers?s experience was not unique. In the case of Tillerson Trump was not even considering much less vetting the oil magnate until his name came up in conversations with former defense chief Robert Gates and Condoleezza Rice the former secretary of state according to multiple published reports. ?It?s dangerous to nominate first and vet later? Eisen said. Both he and Painter said numerous potential appointees in the Bush and Obama administrations had walked away from jobs before their names were made public once they found out how much they?d have to divest. Wealthy nominees have had to forgo millions of dollars in stock options as part of ethics agreements for example. And that doesn?t even account for the damaging personal or political revelations that could threaten Senate confirmation or at minimum surprise and embarrass an administration without preliminary internal investigations. The slow pace of the Trump transition is not limited to the vetting of top Cabinet picks. Aside from a dozen or so senior White House advisers ambassadors and domestic agency heads the  ?s team has moved to fill hardly any of the 4 000 political appointee positions across the federal government including 1 100 that are subject to Senate confirmation. Those include under secretaries assistant secretaries general counsels chief financial officers and agency administrators and directors among other posts. The Partnership for Public Service a nonprofit that provides guidelines job descriptions and advice for presidential transitions has said the new administration should aim to have 100   appointees in place on or around Inauguration Day. At its present rate the Trump administration would be lucky to get a dozen. The transition has also thus far disregarded suggestions to name its Cabinet picks as part of larger slates so that the secretaries do not spend weeks surrounded by empty desks and acting deputies who cannot operate with full authority. ?The issue isn?t how many people you announce? said Max Stier president and CEO of the Partnership. ?The issue is how many qualified people you get in place in real time and working effectively. ? While the Obama transition in   is hailed as the modern gold standard for presidential transfers of power the process in recent decades has more commonly been fraught and slow. Officials in both parties point in particular to 2000 when the   election recount shortened the transition period. Yet the concern over the Trump operation is heightened by the fact that not only the   but also many of his top Cabinet picks have little or no experience in government. If they take office alone they?ll be relying heavily on career civil servants to carry out the enormous change they?ve demanded of the government. That alone might prove to be a significant obstacle. ?You can?t effectively change the government? Stier noted ?if you don?t truly understand how it operates. ?
449,73290,Obama Leaves the Constitution Weaker Than He Found It,Atlantic,Garrett Epps,1/3/2017,2017,1,,Every four years an American citizen puts a hand on a holy book and swears to ?preserve protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. ? Anxiety is understandably high in the weeks before a new hand hits that Bible. But as we obsess about the intentions of the incoming president it is worth asking ourselves how well the current incumbent has preserved our governing document. A President Without an Administration History will likely ponder long before rendering a clear verdict. The best we can say now is that even for those like me who admire Barack Obama the constitutional record is disturbingly mixed. Obama leaves the Constitution weaker than at the beginning of his terms. It now will pass into the hands of a chief executive who appears to have no respect for its limits. Let?s dispense first with the    critique of this administration ?  that it has in some way engaged in ?executive overreach? pushing  executive power to new   heights. It?s a handy story easy to tell and opponents of the Administration are assiduous in repeating it. It is however mostly bosh. It puts powdered wigs and knee britches on mundane policy disputes and appalling legislative obstructionism. Most of the big court cases testing Obama?s powers have actually been statutory arguments with no constitutional issue involved. They have been reported as constitutional clashes but they were really     legal disputes. Compared with most presidents of the past   ?  and especially with his predecessor George W. Bush ?  Barack Obama has in fact been quite reticent about asserting inherent ?executive power? under the Constitution. Consider the use of ?signing statements? ?  documents issued by a president when signing a bill sometimes indicating that the executive branch will refuse to follow parts of the new law because it believes them unconstitutional. George W. Bush issued more than 160 Obama in the same time period 31. In addition the claim that ?executive orders? are   around Congress also doesn?t pass the laugh test. Every president since Washington has used them to implement laws passed by Congress ?  without them bureaucrats can?t enforce new laws. (Some of the programs to which Obama?s critics most strenuously object ?  such as the     immigration initiative ?  didn?t flow from ?executive orders? at all.) But no matter how they have been promulgated Obama?s uses of executive power have had an intriguing common thread. Under Ronald Reagan and the two presidents Bush the executive branch often tied itself to the mast of a strong executive one with ?inherent? powers over war peace and law enforcement that Congress could not limit in any way. (After Congress passed the sweeping 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force for example Bush legal adviser John Yoo sent the president a memo advising that the Congress was out of line for passing it because it suggested he needed authorization to attack any nation or group he chose at any time for any reason.) Obama has never formally subscribed to this   theory. On paper at least he has insisted that he is working hard to fulfill the intent of Congress as expressed in statutes. This is a strategy I call ?aggressive compliance? ?  it pushes the language of a statute as far as it can go in order to avoid a constitutional claim. In practical terms the result is often the same ?  the executive gets its way ?   ?  but there?s no corresponding assertion that Congress has no power. If by some bizarre series of events Congress collected itself to change a statute and managed to overcome a presidential veto of that change then Obama would say of course he would change his actions. It?s better than simply proclaiming a president beyond the law. But it sometimes skates close to the edge of legality. Consider the administration?s claim that it could without Congressional authorization commit U. S. naval and air forces during the 2011 intervention in Libya. The action seemed to violate the 1973 War Powers Resolution which requires a president to notify Congress before introducing U. S. forces into ?hostilities? and seek permission if that intervention lasts more than 60 days. Many presidents have claimed that the Resolution was an unconstitutional limit on their power. Obama instead issued a careful opinion admitting that the Resolution was valid ?  but suggesting that more than 100 cruise missile strikes and dozens of air missions were not somehow ?hostilities. ? It was too clever by half and it is a lasting blot on Obama?s constitutional copybook. Even worse however is the continued conduct of open hostilities in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State despite the refusal of Congress to approve the military campaign. No one questions that the Constitution applies here but because the two branches are unable to agree on the scope of American intervention this most crucial of constitutional guarantees ?  the power of Congress to authorize military action ?  has gone by the board. This is not entirely the president?s fault ?  the administration and its allies have repeatedly begged Congress to at least hold hearings on an authorization bill. As is often the case in history legislators would prefer to stay out of the arena so that they can later claim credit for victory but disclaim any role in disaster. And just to underline how obsolete Congressional authorization has become consider that the most searing   attacks on Obama arise from the one occasion on which he announced he would not intervene abroad without Congressional authorization ?  his 2013 decision not to launch airstrikes against Syria without first going to Congress. Whether he was using constitutional caution as an excuse or not the Constitution clearly required authorization while the political class of both parties has treated Obama?s caution as contemptible. As a   Obama had his limits. Obama hands over to the Trump administration a National Security Agency that is pursuing a robust a program of domestic and foreign surveillance under the relatively thin constraints provided by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments of 2008. The Obama administration has been stunningly aggressive in its incursions on   by reporters prosecuting leakers under the Espionage Act and demanding the phone records of 20 Associated Press reporters as part of a leak investigation. These were far beyond the previous norms ?   ?  and are now part of the background practices inherited by the Trump Administration. The drone warfare program that has grown up under this administration is also only nominally constrained by law with prerogative for the air assassination of Americans abroad at the disposal of the new executive. The administration?s decision not to pursue any serious criminal investigation of torture and illegal detention under Bush means that the formal roadblocks to Trump?s resumption of these crimes (which he has promised) will be few. So well protected was the   establishment under Obama that its head Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was forced to admit lying to Congress under oath about the NSA ?metadata? program ?   ?  and suffered no adverse consequences as a result. The above is a sobering record for an administration that liked to pose as a friend of the Constitution and of civil liberties. History?s judgment may be tempered by the evidence that Obama wanted to do better. He struggled for eight years for example to close the extraterritorial prison camp at Guantanamo. He did seek authorization for the IS campaign. He tried hard to reach across the partisan aisle to forge legislation. In those efforts he was largely stymied by an opposition whose commitment to genuine constitutionalism was not to put too fine a point on it almost nil. The new   Republican Party that emerged from the 2010 elections took and takes no responsibility for constitutional norms whether it was honoring the obligations of the national debt or considering presidential nominees to judgeships and executive agencies. But the job of a president is to overcome obstacles build political support and mobilize public opinion. Obama?s record is that of a smart determined but politically weak president. Regardless of fault there?s little doubt that he leaves the Constitution weaker than he found it.

Making Waves: A new study in the journal Science Advances confirms that the world?s oceans have steadily warmed for the past five decades flying in the face of speculation by Representative Lamar Smith that similar findings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were politically biased. The research underscores how climate change is a scientific fact ?  and thus solutions can and should come from both sides of the aisle. Toward that goal a small group of GOP environmentalists is hopeful that   Donald Trump ?  despite his ominous record of denying climate science ?  will pursue solutions using the free market. In the meantime President Obama has shored up another environmental legacy: With the creation and expansion of several marine monuments he?s protected more ocean than any other U. S. president. Speaking of Legacy: Republicans in Congress will likely vote soon to repeal Obamacare although they haven?t yet proposed a specific plan to replace it. Instead they?ll likely delay the   in hopes of easing the transition ?  but this approach could still cause chaos in the   market as patients scramble to get coverage while they can. Also worrying for consumers: An investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reveals that two major   agencies Equifax and Transunion have been deceiving customers by misrepresenting their score reports and using misleading ads. Political Geography: In the aftermath of the U. S. presidential election one of the most discussed factors has been the   divide ?  a cultural disconnect between   and country communities coupled with an electoral system that gives people in less populated areas more relative power. That issue isn?t limited to Americans: Over 20 other countries notably Japan and Argentina have systems that favor rural voters sometimes with serious policy consequences. Back in the U. S. Democrats are trying to work within the system by renewing their focus on local politics ?  but here?s why that shift might be too difficult. Jessica Lahey on ?design thinking? one of education?s latest buzzwords: Historically creativity has been portrayed as a mysterious elusive force ?  a gift from the gods or the muses. Creativity can?t be summoned the thinking goes let alone taught to the mentally inflexible unimaginative   masses. Design thinking upends that perception and assumes that anyone can be a creative  . At its best design thinking incorporates   teaching techniques such as   inquiry and collaborative   and dovetails nicely with   learning curricula that emphasize interpersonal skills such as collaboration and empathy. And the end result of a   project is often a tangible product such as a model city a robot or a better mousetrap.  It?s no surprise then that many educators are eager to adopt design thinking as a way to plan their own teaching and as a strategy for helping their students learn through solving   problems.   ?     If it is hastily and inexpertly implemented by educators with a weak or incomplete understanding of its principles however it is likely to be a waste of energy and precious classroom time. Keep reading here as Lahey explains what exactly design thinking is and how teachers can make the best use of it. 1.

Alex writes: I became a citizen of this country on    after having emigrated from the Netherlands in 1970. The main reason I wanted to become a citizen is so I could vote for Barack Obama as president of these United States of America. It was a very proud day for me. My wife other family and some good friends were with me at the Los Angeles convention center and there were thousands of people being sworn in that day. The thing that struck me was that some of them really didn?t seem to give a damn about what was happening while for me ?  all dressed up in my best suit and tie ?  it was really quite emotional. The judge was very eloquent in describing the various benefits and duties of a U. S. citizen. After the ceremony was over I walked proudly with tears in my eyes and took my family and friends to a fancy restaurant to celebrate. I have always felt optimistic about this country in all the years that I?ve been here ?  until now with the election of the most unqualified individual to ever hold the office of the president. I feel angry sad and very worried about where this complete buffoon will take us. If you?re a naturalized U.

On this day in 1847 Samuel Colt ?  described in our November 1880 issue as ?a man of fine presence   ?     and of indomitable perseverance? ?  sold a thousand of his first revolvers to the Texas Rangers. In our November 2000 issue Richard Slotkin described how firearms subsequently spread: The techniques of mass production and serial fire perfected by Samuel Colt made guns cheaper to own and easier to use. The handgun ?  which had been a luxury item in the days of the   flint pistol ?  was now a viable weapon for the ordinary citizen interested in   and killing small game. But lower prices alone did not cause gun ownership to spread. The California Gold Rush and the opening of the Far West to settlement increased population and activity in the contested borderlands between the United States and Mexico and around Native American tribes.

452,73294,Coming Soon to the U.S. Army: Turbans Beards Hijabs and Cornrows,Atlantic,Emma Green,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Updated 6:01 p. m. EST The Army has issued a new regulation: Effective immediately   commanders will be able to grant accommodations to servicemen and women who wear beards turbans or hijabs for religious reasons ?  the three most common requests for waivers to current guidelines on grooming and dress according to a letter from the Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning. The new guidelines also revise hairstyle standards for female soldiers: They can now wear dreadlocks cornrows or twists provided they?re relatively small uniform neat and tied off inconspicuously and they don?t have to request an accommodation to do so. The Trouble With Wearing Turbans in America This might seem like an odd choice for a policy directive in the final days of the Obama administration. It came about largely in response to litigation and advocacy from Sikh servicemen who wear beards and turbans for religious reasons and who wanted to be able to keep them while actively serving. While this ruling will make a big difference for those soldiers there are very few of them. Eric Baxter an attorney at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty one of the firms that has been advocating on behalf of the Sikh soldiers attributed the timing to fear of continued litigation. ?The pressure of the lawsuit was a significant factor in deciding this needs to be finished? he said. ?The time had just come when it was no longer possible to make excuses for why Sikhs need to be excluded. ? It?s possible that the Army felt it had no options and wanted to put the issue to rest but also possible the directive reflects some other unstated motive. Regardless of the intent though this regulation sends a signal: It makes the Army more inclusive of minority religions and cultures right as Donald Trump prepares to take office. The new regulations are a response to a   issue within the military. In the 1986 the Supreme Court heard a case brought by an Orthodox Jewish rabbi Simcha Goldman who had been forbidden by the Air Force to wear a yarmulke while on duty and in uniform. The Court deferred to the military. In response Congress passed a rule stating that servicemen should be able to wear religious apparel. ?When you look at the legislative history for that law Congress spoke openly about the need to accommodate Sikhs and Jews? said Baxter. ?But the military has always construed it as only applying to the yarmulke. ? Over the years military officers have regularly dealt with requests for religious exemptions to various rules. Douglas Carver a Southern Baptist minister who is the former chief chaplain for the Army said he faced his first religious exemption requests almost as soon as he became a chaplain. When he retired from service in 2011 the conversation about a possible   revision had already been happening for years he said. ?The military is strong on tradition and order. When you?re going to have someone who looks different in the ranks it takes a lot of discussion and exploration and advisement. ? Recently Sikhs have taken up the cause. Within the last year several serviceman have sued the Army to be able to keep their turbans and beards. Until now the Army has responded with temporary fixes ?  exemptions granted on a limited    basis. The military expressed safety concerns about the way beards or other headwear might undermine the effectiveness of gear and began conducting studies about the feasibility of broader exemptions. Over time these exemptions provided evidence that soldiers could successfully serve while wearing   dress according to Fanning?s letter. Now officers across the military will be able to address requests for religious exemptions with the guidance of the Chaplain Corps which is responsible for training service units on the new rules. Once an accommodation has been granted it can only be permanently revoked by the secretary of the Army or his designee. The military will also continue testing for safety hazards for now soldiers with religious accommodations are restricted from serving in positions involving toxic chemicals and other potentially dangerous substances. Carver sees the new regulation as an accomplishment for the Army. Faith is a major part of many service members? lives religious affiliation is even listed on soldiers? dog tags he pointed out. ?You are prepared to go into harm?s way even to die and practice of your religious belief brings courage and calmness? he said. ?A soldier should not have to feel that he?s about to give his life for his country but that he doesn?t want to compromise his individual faith or practices. ? The new policy seems to be in keeping with other military policies set during the Obama administration. In June Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced a new policy allowing transgender service members to serve openly. ?We can?t allow barriers unrelated to a person?s qualifications prevent us from recruiting and retaining those who can best accomplish the mission? he said. The new regulations on religious dress and hairstyles address a different issue but they still accomplish the same basic goal: They make the largest branch of the military more inclusive and allow more Americans to serve their country.
453,73295,Why Is Trump So Reluctant to Accept Claims of Russian Hacking?,Atlantic,David A. Graham,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Even by the   standards of the   Donald Trump?s response to the accusations of Russian interference with the election is somewhat puzzling. On the side that believes Russia is to blame and ought to be punished are the White House the Republican leadership and most of the    in both houses of Congress and the intelligence community. They point to a plausible motive which is the Kremlin?s hatred of Hillary Clinton and a plausible precursor which is the Kremlin?s pattern of interfering with other governments? elections. Opposing them are Trump his inner circles of aides the Kremlin which denies responsibility and WikiLeaks which insists it did not receive the documents from   hackers. While there is some principled skepticism about attributing the hacks to Russia Trump?s mockery of the intelligence community has not cited specific concerns. And if as his adviser Kellyanne Conway suggests Trump is receiving information from other sources it?s unclear why it would be more credible or accurate than that provided by the intelligence community. Moreover neither Trump?s record of being either misinformed or simply uninformed about policy matters foreign and domestic nor his choice of Mike Flynn who has a penchant for lending credence to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories as his national security adviser provide much reason to believe him over the consensus view of the intelligence community. But Trump?s reluctance to publicly accept Russian responsibility for the hack might have less to do with how he views the evidence than with how he views the stakes of the argument. He has consistently placed his emphasis on winning and on presenting himself as a winner. And to the extent that claims of Russian hacking call the nature of his electoral victory into doubt he?s responded by dismissing those claims and emphasizing his triumph. Take this pair of tweets on Wednesday morning: Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have ?hacking defense? like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible. ..... things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media as usual gave them a pass. On its face this argument is incoherent. There?s no evident conflict between the view that the DNC should have maintained better defenses against intruders and acted more forcefully when informed about hacking attempts and the view that foreign interference with U. S. elections is a dangerous thing. Trump?s emphasis on a particular detail in the leaked DNC emails is similarly baffling. In one email once and current interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile was revealed to have passed along a question for a future Democratic primary debate to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was hardly ignored by the press Brazile lost her contributor gig at CNN as a result. Bernie Sanders might be justifiably upset about Brazile?s actions although the question she passed to Clinton was eminently predictable but   cheating in a Democratic presidential debate is also unrelated to the charge that a foreign government attempted to influence the presidential general election. But the tweets become more legible if they?re read as a simple tally of advantages and disadvantages. Trump is unusually focused on ?fairness? ?  consider the number of times he has tweeted about it ?  although his definition of the word often seems to hinge on whether or not something is good for him. But this idiosyncratic conception of fairness helps to explain Trump?s view of the hacks: If hacks targeted at the DNC helped give him a leg up then they are counterbalanced by Brazile?s cheating even if one is the result of a questionable   model of hiring partisan operators and the other is allegedly designed to undermine American democracy. Many Democrats encouraged this kind of thinking in which partisan advantage is the metric by which competing claims are evaluated with their muted responses to the initial reports of Russian hacking. When they believed that the interference was simply a headwind that would hinder but not stop Hillary Clinton?s march to the White House they were willing to not make a big deal out of it. They may be right now that foreign interference in American elections is unacceptable but they undermined their standing to make that case by downplaying it when they thought they had the political advantage. The same   view might also help explain the alliances Trump strikes which follow an almost amusingly straightforward        formulation. Perhaps Trump reasons that if he?s against Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton Obama is out to get Putin and Putin is out to get Clinton then he should be for Putin. This would be one way to explain the sudden embrace of Julian Assange by Trump and his supporters. In 2010 CNN reports Trump was asked about Wikileaks: ?I think it?s disgraceful I think there should be like death penalty or something. ? Fox News? Sean Hannity also used to deplore Assange but now finds him eminently trustworthy when he says Russian hackers were not WikiLeaks? source. Sarah Palin has decided he?s OK too. Meanwhile Trump?s ostensible ally Paul Ryan the speaker of the House told Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday that Assange was ?a sycophant for Russia? who ?steals data and compromises national security. ? (Of course one can believe the documents Assange has produced over the years while still questioning his motivations and his account of how he obtained those files.) The press has eagerly ferreted out scores of inconsistencies in Trump?s public statements. On the hacks alone there?s the conflict between his openly saying Russia should hack Hillary Clinton and his recent refusal to acknowledge Russia might even be a factor or between his discussion of hacking during the campaign and his more recent preposterous claim that no one brought it up during the campaign. Reporters should continue to do this because it?s a valuable service for the public but it?s not a surprise that Trump isn?t ashamed of the inconsistencies. Trump?s calculus is much simpler and more manichean. It was often said that Barack Obama was playing ?  chess? against his opponents. Trump is proudly playing checkers. And he?s winning.
454,73296,Earth?s Oceans Are Steadily Warming,Atlantic,Robinson Meyer,1/4/2017,2017,1,,It?s sometimes said that modern science spends too much time on the documentation of a new trend and too little time on the replication of old ones. A new paper published Wednesday in the   journal Science Advances is important just because it does the latter. In fact it sheds light on the scientific process in action ?  and also reveals how   denialists can muddy that process. Here?s the big takeaway from the new study: Across the planet the ocean surface has been warming at a relatively steady clip over the past 50 years. This warming trend shows up whether the ocean is measured by buoy by satellite or by autonomous floating drone. It also shows up in the global temperature dataset created and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In fact the warming shows up in both datasets in essentially the same way. This is important because it confirms the integrity of the NOAA dataset ?  and adds further evidence to the argument that ocean temperatures have steadily warmed this century without a significant slowdown. ?Our results essentially confirm that NOAA got it right? says Zeke Hausfather a researcher and economist at the University of California Berkeley. ?They weren?t cooking the books. They weren?t bowing to any political pressure to find results that show extra warming. They were a bunch of scientists trying their hardest to work with messy data. ? Here?s why the finding matters: In June 2015 NOAA published an update to its   dataset of historical global temperatures. Thomas Karl the director of the National Centers for Environmental Information and his colleagues at NOAA explained in a paper in Science that the old database had a critical flaw. In trying to merge temperature readings taken by ships and buoys NOAA had been allowing ?cooling bias? to seep into its numbers. In other words NOAA?s global temperature estimates had been too low and its measurement of climate change was too conservative. With this newly updated data in hand Karl and his colleagues found there had been no slowdown in global warming during the 2000s. NOAA?s new findings disagreed with those of the U. K. Met Office whose widely used global temperature dataset does show a slowdown in the 2000s. So: Was there a slowdown? This is an interesting problem of some scientific interest. Researchers have pointed to El Nio to multiyear oceanic cycles and to the   reforestation of Russia as possible explanations for the change. But here?s the thing: The slowdown or lack thereof never threw the larger phenomenon of   climate change into question. In fact even among the most conservative estimates the globe kept warming right through the slowdown. The overwhelming consensus of Earth scientists is that the planet is harmfully warming due to human industrial activity. What?s more if a slowdown did occur in the 2000s it seems to have abated now. The previous three years ?  2014 2015 and 2016 ?  have all broken the record as the hottest year ever in the modern temperature record. But this hasn?t seemed to matter in public debate as   denialists have found enormous success casting doubt on global warming by glomming onto this ?slowdown? debate. When the UN?s 2013 assessment report on climate science said a slowdown seemed to have occurred it dominated press accounts. That same report also found that global warming was real quickly becoming irreversible and that humans were more implicated in the phenomenon than ever ?  but it hardly seemed to matter. It was the slowdown that made headlines. Perhaps this is why Representative Lamar Smith a Republican of Texas who chairs the House Committee on Science Space and Technology siezed on the 2015 NOAA study. Smith rejects the existence of climate change and he alleged that that NOAA scientists had ?altered the data? in their study to get a chosen result. So in late 2015 he issued a subpoena to the agency demanding all emails related to the study. Several months later he expanded the demand again requiring all documents and communications that included the words ?temperature? ?change? ?climate? ?Obama? ?buoy? ?Karl? ?ship? and ?Paris. ? During this time Smith falsely represented the research on the topic. He said climate data had ?clearly showed no warming for the past two decades? which is not true. And when a new paper arguing for a slowdown during a different time period came out last year in Science Smith said that it ?confirms the halt in global warming. ? But that paper showed no halt ?  it only argued for the slowdown. And its authors specifically wrote: ?We do not believe that warming has ceased. ? There is no valid scientific debate about a ?halt? but Smith seemed to be trying to manufacture one. The Center for Science and Democracy a nonpartisan advocacy group for scientists in the civil service said that Smith was harassing NOAA for doing its job. ?The use of a sledgehammer of a congressional subpoena to cast so wide a net is unprecedented and unjustified? said Andrew Rosenberg its director in a letter to the House committee. In June of this year Smith responded by issuing a subpoena to the Center?s parent organization the Union of Concerned Scientists. The   said that Smith was well outside his legal authority and it declined to respond. * * * Which brings us back to the new study. It finds that Smith was wrong: NOAA?s results are scientifically defensible and its global temperature records match those prepared by different means. It does this by comparing NOAA?s record to all the smaller highly reliable records that constitute it. ?The way that NOAA makes an ocean record is they take data from a lot of different sources and they smush it all together into a single record. They do this so they can have a long continuous record back to 1880 or so? Hausfather told me. Creating a record from 1880 is difficult however ?  especially for the oceans where there are no   weather stations. Scientists have to piece disparate historical records together over time. This is a typical problem in climate science but it?s typical that some of those constituent datasets impose slightly different biases on the data. Before the 1990s most of NOAA?s   records came from ships logs. Ships are tricky because they have historically measured the sea surface in different ways. During the   century most sailors measured the water temperature using ?bucket measurements?: They hauled a bucket over the side dipped it in the water brought it up and put a thermometer in it. More recently most ships measure the ocean temperature mechanically through an ?  valve. ? Ships pump water into their hull in order to cool the engine room and a thermometer measures its temperature on the way. This can introduce bias to the numbers though: Because engine rooms get hot    readings are skewed warmer than the actual ocean. That?s partly why since the 1990s the governments of the world have deployed a fleet of new sensors to measure the changing sea. Buoys satellites and autonomous sensors called Argo floats all patrol the ocean and measure its conditions. This has dramatically changed the makeup of NOAA?s temperature record: Whereas 95 percent of NOAA?s readings came from ship engine rooms in the early 1990s 85 percent now come from buoys. The fleet has provided a wealth of new data for climate science. But it also provokes the central scientific question of the NOAA study. Given the same patch of ocean a thermometer on a buoy will produce a colder measurement than a thermometer on an   valve. This introduces some bias to the record ?  bias which for years NOAA never corrected. Think of what was happening in historical context: At the same time the oceans were supposedly experiencing a slowdown in warming NOAA transitioned from mostly ships to mostly using buoys. The underlying ocean may still have been warming but NOAA?s record was diluted by thermometers inclined to be cooler and cooler. ?The problem was NOAA previously was just sticking the buoy data in with the ship data ?  and not accounting for the fact that the buoy data was about a tenth of a degree cooler than the ship? says Hausfather. This was Karl?s insight: He and the NOAA team found that once this discrepancy was corrected for the slowdown disappeared from their record. In fact removing this discrepancy was the main focus of their infamous 2015 study. The team behind Wednesday?s Science Advances paper wanted to test this idea. There?s all this disagreement over correcting for bias they thought. What if you looked only at records that didn?t need to be corrected? So Hausfather and his colleagues compared the new NOAA data to what they call ?instrumentally homogenous records? ?  that is records created by sensors that did not change throughout the period in question. In this case those sensors are   buoys Argo floaters and   satellites. What they found is that the   records matched the new NOAA global temperature records almost precisely. Almost all the   records showed that the   NOAA records had a cooling bias. They also showed a slight cooling bias in the more popular U. K. database. Specifically data from the buoys and satellites agree with the NOAA record nearly perfectly. Those records are considered the most reliable and they cover the entire period studied. The Argo data covers the shortest amount of time ?  only 11 years ?  so the authors used three different global realizations of the same raw data. Two of the three of those sets found that NOAA?s data may have been too cool. The third ?was more ambiguous? write the authors. And that means they showed no global warming slowdown. ?There?s no evidence from a statistical standpoint that temperatures over the last 15 years have been warming any slower than temperatures over the last 30 years or the last 50 years? Hausfather told me. The paper has been greeted warmly by the larger climate science community at least so far. ?The laborious process in which scientists check and recheck their work and subject their ideas to peer review has led to another success? writes John Abraham a thermal scientist who studies ocean temperatures at The Guardian. ?This paper is another reminder why it is so important to invest in the temperature measurements that are needed to create   climate records. We really need uninterrupted measurements that span many   if we want to truly understand the Earth?s changing climate? he adds. It?s not clear that this paper will end the scientific dispute over whether the early 2000s showed anomalous warming or not. But it should end any spurious claims that NOAA?s updates were politically motivated. And it should refocus readers on the main point: Human activity is already warming Earth and causing harmful changes to the seas ice weather and land. On that climate science is in overwhelming agreement.
455,73297,Trump Picks Jay Clayton to Head the SEC,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,1/4/2017,2017,1,,On Wednesday Trump?s transition team confirmed that the   will nominate Jay Clayton to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In recent days Clayton a Wall Street lawyer had emerged as the frontrunner ahead of other rumored considerations including Debra Wong Yang a former U. S. Attorney and activist investor Carl Icahn. In a press release Trump called Clayton ?a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law? who will take part in ?unleashing the   power of our economy by encouraging investment in American companies while providing strong oversight of Wall Street and related industries. ? Clayton is currently a partner at the law firm Sullivan  Cromwell who works with Wall Street firms on mergers and acquisitions and regulatory investigations. According to the law firm?s website Clayton represented large banks including Goldman Sachs and Barclays Capital during the financial crisis. He?s also represented large financial institutions looking to settle   claims with authorities. The SEC is often referred to as Wall Street?s watchdog. The agency is tasked with protecting investors and maintaining fair markets which can include everything from investigating claims of unfair trading practices to implementing rules and regulations to keep financial markets ?  and those who trade in them ?  safe. That?s a large part of the reason that the nomination for the head of the SEC has been closely watched. During the campaign   Trump said that his intent was to cut regulation ?massively. ? In the press release announcing the intention to nominate Clayton Trump added ?We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers. ? Many expect that a   Trump administration will reshape the way the agency polices Wall Street but it isn?t immediately clear which specific regulations the new SEC chairman would scale back on and how. One set of regulations that?s been mentioned is the   Act which the SEC enforces and which Trump?s team has promised to ?dismantle. ? Still it?s largely unclear what Clayton?s stance on rolling back regulation would be. In the press release Clayton echoed Trump?s sentiment that policy should be set to encourage job creation. Mary Jo White the SEC?s current chairman announced her plans to step down after the election which isn?t unusual during a change of administration. But there will be significantly more turnover than White. There are two additional openings on the   commission. (Traditionally the commission is made up of two Democratic commissioners and two Republican commissioners in addition to the chairman.) And four division directors at the SEC have announced their departures in the past month including Andrew Ceresney the director of the SEC?s enforcement division. The exodus was largely expected after White announced her departure but with so many empty seats it opens the door for the SEC and its new head to be less tough on Wall Street banks.
456,73298,Two Major Credit Reporting Agencies Have Been Lying to Consumers,Atlantic,Gillian B. White,1/4/2017,2017,1,,In personal finance practically everything can turn on one?s credit score. It?s both an indicator of one?s financial past and the key to accessing necessities ?  without insane costs ?  in the future. But on Tuesday the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that two of the three major   agencies responsible for doling out those scores ?  Equifax and Transunion ?  have been deceiving and taking advantage of Americans. The Bureau ordered the agencies to pay more than $23 million in fines and restitution.   In their investigation the Bureau found that the two agencies had been misrepresenting the scores provided to consumers telling them that the score reports they received were the same reports that lenders and businesses received when in fact they were not. The investigation also found problems with the way the agencies advertised their products using promotions that suggested that their credit reports were either free or cost only $1. According to the CFPB the agencies did not properly disclose that after a trial of seven to 30 days individuals would be enrolled in a   subscription which could total $16 or more per month. The Bureau also found Equifax to be in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act which states that the agencies must provide one free report every 12 months made available at a central site. Before viewing their free report consumers were forced to view advertisements for Equifax which is prohibited by law. That these credit agencies would abuse their power to mislead Americans attempting to take a more active role in monitoring their financial health is not only a violation of trust it is dangerous. These agencies ?  along with a third Experian ?  make up the nation?s   industry and as such they wield a significant and unique influence over America?s? financial health. Many lenders use only the data from these providers to determine whether someone can get a loan and how much interests he will pay. ?Credit scores are central to a consumer?s financial life and people deserve honest and accurate information about them? said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in a statement.   agencies keep track of an individual?s overall debt picture how much credit they have access to and how frequently payments are late among other things. They then assign a score ranging from 300 to 850 which is consulted before one rents an apartment gets a loan opens a credit card buys a car or even gets a cell phone. Much of an individual?s ability to improve his or her finances is predicated on his or her ability to maintain a high credit score. To do that he or she needs to be able to see accurate credit reports that reflect the information that lenders see when they assess them. The actions of Equifax and Transunion prevented that. And that?s especially troubling because the American credit system is a reinforcing cycle. Good credit often comes from having enough money to pay bills off in a timely manner which raises one?s score and provides access to more credit at better interest rates. That can amount to tens of thousands of dollars in savings on mortgages business loans and   card interest. And having good credit means that a person?s score can sustain the decline that comes with lender inquiries for new credit cards or loans which then gives them access to more credit ?  and raises their score once again. For Americans with bad credit and little income they system works in exactly the opposite manner and leaves people relegated to pricey and predatory options for basic financial needs. In 2010 the CFPB found that 26 million Americans had no credit history and another 19 million had such limited credit history that they were considered unscorable. These groups were primarily made up of   and minority households. Credit scores and the agencies that provide them have long been a point of contention among consumer advocates not only because the system further marginalizes those who are already struggling but also because it offers very limited opportunities to improve one?s financial standing. Even obtaining understanding and correcting official credit reports can be tricky   and in some cases costly.  As a result consumer advocates have called for greater accessibility and pushed  alternative credit indicators. That two major providers of score data have been intentionally deceiving Americans confirms what those advocates have been saying all along: This is a deeply dysfunctional system that is hurting the Americans who can least afford it.
457,73299,The Growing Urban-Rural Divide Around the World,Atlantic,Jon Emont,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Immediately following the U. S. presidential election on November 8   Trump demonstrations sprang up in New York San Francisco and Los Angeles ?  cities that vote overwhelmingly Democratic. The protesters felt robbed: Hillary Clinton had won the majority of voters nationwide. But like Al Gore in 2000 Clinton was hamstrung by the Electoral College an institution designed to ensure a voice for sparsely populated states in America?s early years ?  and one that of late has spelled doom for candidates with   coalitions. 10 Elections to Watch in 2017 The outsized influence of rural voters may seem like a unique feature ?  or bug ?  of the American political system. But a similar story recurs in places around the world. In over 20 countries from Argentina to Malaysia to Japan the structure of the electoral systems gives rural voters disproportionate power relative to their numbers over their more numerous   counterparts. And on certain issues this can shift national priorities in favor of rural ones. In the United States in 2016 for example the Republican platform called for eliminating federal funding for public transit arguing that it ?serves only a small portion of the population concentrated in six big cities? implying that Trump?s expected infrastructure bill could focus on highways rather than on urban transit networks. Global warming of special concern to urban coastal voters has been described essentially as intriguing speculation by the  . In America each state regardless of population size receives at least three electors and a candidate who wins a majority of a state?s popular vote wins all of its electors assuming all those electors accept the vote (with the exceptions of Nebraska and Maine). Effectively this means that the 259 000 registered voters of   mostly conservative Wyoming have around three and a half times as much representation in the electoral college as the 12. 5 million and 18 million voters respectively of large heavily urban states like New York and California. Perhaps the nightmare scenario for this kind of electoral imbalance is Argentina. The country?s upper house of parliament is modeled off the U. S. Senate ?  where each state is represented by two senators ?  so underpopulated states have the same voting power as densely populated Buenos Aires. But in Argentina?s lower house each province no matter its population receives at least five representatives thanks to reforms passed by the outgoing military government in 1983 that in effect gave a leg up to conservative politicians. As a result the voters of Tierra El Fuego a sparsely populated province have 180 times as much representation per person as Buenos Aires voters in the Chamber of Deputies. This has a major impact on policy. Ezequial Ocantos an associate professor of comparative politics at the University of Oxford said that voters in Argentina?s outlying provinces receive massive cash transfers from the federal government even as the country as a whole struggles to maintain fiscal solvency. ?Some people would say [this is] at the heart of Argentina?s fiscal problems. There?s some truth to that? Ocantos said. By many measures outlying provinces are dramatically   by Argentina?s central government than is Buenos Aires which contains around 40 percent of the country?s population. ?Lots of studies show these [outlying] provinces get more infrastructure and [state] employment? said Maria Victoria Murillo a political science professor at Columbia. This contributes to Buenos Aires?s mounting struggles to provide affordable housing and   infrastructure for its ballooning population as well as the province?s disproportionately high unemployment rate compared with the rest of the country. Japan?s legislature does not fare much better on this score. Its apportionment of representatives was never fully updated to reflect   migration to urban areas after World War II when the country rebuilt its   cities and quickly industrialized. In 2013 the country?s highest court ruled that Japan?s elections existed ?in a state of unconstitutionality? due to the extra voting power wielded by rural voters. (This warning however failed to prompt   changes to the system.) The result has been policies that hurt the urban majority but benefited the rural minority. Michael Thies a professor of political science at the University of California Los Angeles credited the power of the rural vote in Japan with delaying structural reforms to the economy such as lowering the country?s onerous food import tariffs and decreasing   agricultural subsidies. The dominant Liberal Democratic Party has ?been trying to wean the party off the organized rural vote in favor of market liberalization for nearly 20 years but they have struggled with the ability of those rural interests to fight back? Thies said. It?s only now with the country?s dwindling rural voters representing such a small percentage of the population that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has succeeded in pushing through   agricultural reforms. In particular the power wielded by elderly rural voters has arguably contributed to widespread pessimism among Japanese urbanites about their economic future. Japan has one of the world?s oldest populations and as in the United States rural voters tend to be substantially older than urban voters. The power of the elderly rural vote has made it very difficult for Japan already saddled with one of the world?s greatest debt burdens to reform its expensive social security system in a way that would curb benefits and attempt to make it sustainable for future generations. ?If representation was shifted to a more     result then the power of the agricultural lobby and the social security lobby   ?     would be reduced? Robert Feldman the head of Japan economic research at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. told Bloomberg. But     remains a pipe dream in Japan which could help explain why the country?s largely urban youth are the most pessimistic young people in the world with 37 percent expecting to work until they die. Meanwhile globalization is polarizing urban and rural voter decisions throughout the world including in the United States. Jonathan Rodden a professor of political science at Stanford who is writing a book about   voter cleavages said ?The people who benefit from globalization and trade live in cosmopolitan city centers and the people who feel left behind typically live outside the city centers.   ?     I would anticipate a growing   cleavage based on that. ? There?s plenty of evidence for this. In Austria?s national elections in December Alexander Van der Bellen the Green Party candidate triumphed narrowly over Norbert Hofer of the   Freedom Party after getting a majority in nine of Austria?s 10 largest cities the Freedom Party by contrast won most rural districts handily. In Britain those who voted to leave the European Union were concentrated in rural areas. The same goes for the support base of France?s   leader Marine Le Pen. Donald Trump lost cities by historic margins but made up for that with his rural support base. The worry is that if globalization leads urban and rural voters to embrace starkly different political agendas around the world democracies like the United States that give rural voters extra power will face crises of legitimacy as national policy is determined by a political minority. ?Politics is just a pitched battle between these two geographically based groups? Rodden said. There is already reason to worry that Donald Trump will exacerbate this divide. He has emphasized social issues that strongly polarize rural and urban voters by promising to appoint judges who will modify Roe vs. Wade as well as protect the second amendment. His economic policies may be just as polarizing. ?If his economic policy is primarily an effort to bring back manufacturing in the Rust Belt and bring back coal [at] the expense of the innovation economy and knowledge economy in the cities   ?     that would presumably have an impact on how people evaluate? the fairness of the constitutional system Rodden said. The risk for the United States is that a failure to reform its democratic system will lead to the same crises of legitimacy seen in democratic systems elsewhere as its urban majorities question why their priorities go ignored. Kai Ostwald a professor of Comparative Politics at the University of British Columbia compared America?s situation to that of Malaysia where urban voters are disillusioned after failing to unseat the ruling party despite winning the popular vote in the 2013 election. This happened thanks to a districting system that favors rural areas in terms of parliamentary representatives he said. ?It will certainly take time before we get the kind of disenfranchisement and sense of helplessness in the U. S. that is pervasive in Malaysia [one where] the political system is so fundamentally biased that there is no sense in participating. But I?m not sure that that sense isn?t already quite strong in the U. S. electorate? he said. Certainly there is a sense of desperation among some American voters now that the loser of the popular vote has won the presidency in two of the last five elections ?  both times at a Democrat?s expense. (Some Democratic electors reportedly plotted a futile   effort to select someone other than Trump as President.) Prominent Silicon Valley titans have latched onto plans to have California secede from the union out of frustration with the Electoral College. Those frustrated with the Electoral College can take inspiration from Argentina which succeeded in abolishing its own ahead of a 1995 national election as part of a political compromise that allowed voter in Buenos Aires to be equally represented in elections for this one branch of government. (The legislature is another matter.) But such a compromise is almost impossible to imagine in today?s polarized Washington where the Republicans that now control the government have no incentive to tamper with a political system that benefits them. ?If the frustration level gets ratcheted up I don?t know where we go. There?s either institutional reform or secession. Neither of those things happen easily given our constitution. That?s just the predicament that we?re in? Rodden said.
458,73301,Hedge-Fund Managers With Flashy Sports Cars Make Worse Investors,Atlantic,Nicholas Clairmont,1/4/2017,2017,1,,   For most lay investors figuring out how to allocate money presents a dilemma. A dizzying maze of experts investors fund managers and advisors exists to allow people to outsource their questions to a financial professional who can make responsible decisions on their behalf to grow savings. But to reliably figure out who won?t rip them off or make bad calls regular people have to know so much that they could almost invest the money themselves in the first place. Finance writers and others in the   business offer some shortcuts to try to keep things simple. These range from the objectively good ?  making sure that the people in charge of money have an obligation to put clients? interests first without which they?re likely to look out for themselves and their employer ?  to the more dubious and  . To wit: One famous old rule has it that clients looking to hand over their money should avoid advisors who drive flashy sports cars since they?re likely to be   unscrupulous or both. Conversely those with a practical   car are said to perform better. Turns out this is one of those bits of folk wisdom that happens to be true. A group of researchers from NYU?s Stern School of Business the University of Central Florida the University of Florida?s Warrington College of Business Administration and Singapore Management University set out to test it empirically looking at a sample of 1 774 vehicles owned by 1 144   managers. Based on information that financiers are required by law to disclose to the government he and his fellow researchers looked up   data on car purchases and matched the   to the autos. Sure enough   cars signal   investors: The study finds that leadfoots make more trades bring in smaller returns for clients exhibit a greater volatility in the returns their investments earn per year and are more likely to have been caught violating financial regulations. The researchers Stephen Brown Yan Lu Sugata Ray  and Melvyn Teo began with a hypothesis about a psychological trait called ?sensation seeking. ? As they write the trait is ?defined by the seeking of varied novel complex and intense sensations and experiences and the willingness to take physical social legal and financial risks for the sake of such experience. ? Major sensation seekers in other words are the sort of people who probably make for good Hollywood protagonists and they are more likely to step outside the law. Among other correlates established by earlier research people with the trait are less careful with spending and engage in risky driving. So when their disposable incomes start to swell the researchers reasoned they are more likely to stop by a Ferrari showroom than a Subaru lot. The study?s authors reason that   managers make for perfect subjects for observing the upsides and downsides of being a sensation seeker since they work in a relatively unconstrained sector of the finance industry where personal tendencies towards risk and crime are less likely to be reined in by regulation or norms as well as more likely to show up in   records and mandatory disclosures of past violations. But the researchers theorize that the same would be true of other finance professionals who make investment decisions though it may be less pronounced. It?s important to clarify that investing is inherently risky and that there is such a thing as good risk versus bad risk. For instance if one can afford to it?s rational to bet on a   chance that pays out more than double. But the researchers found that the    managers are more likely to take bad risks their   strategies don?t produce greater rewards. Quite the opposite Brown and co. write: We find that hedge fund managers who own powerful sports cars take on more investment risk. Conversely managers who own practical but unexciting cars take on less investment risk. The incremental risk taking by performance car buyers does not translate to higher returns   ?     In addition performance car owners are more likely to terminate their funds engage in fraudulent behavior load up on   stocks . .. and succumb to overconfidence. The data show that the returns from investments made under   managers who drive sports cars are about 17 percent more volatile than returns from ones who don?t have sports cars. These people trade in big sums these numbers mean millions. An even more instructive finding comes from the data on the correlation between car type and violations reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to disclosures that traders are required to file with the government   owners are 17. 3 percent more likely to have committed an SEC violation than are other car owners. On the other extreme minivan drivers are a full 44. 6 percent likelier than the rest to have a clean record. To be glib fraudsters like roadsters. One of the things the researchers worried could skew their results is the subjects? possible biases towards particular car companies. If   tend to buy a certain brand and that brand happens to make lots of   with high horsepower then the results would reflect the automakers? characteristics not the investors?. The study contains an analysis of the data controlling for these potential   biases ?  say against a dowdier automaker (like Volvo) or towards one could that makes lots of peppy sports cars (the paper mentions BMW though Porsche is a more likely culprit). Yet the findings hold when controlling for this possible bias among other potential confounding variables. One quibble automotive enthusiasts may have with the study?s methodology is how it distinguishes between performance cars and   cars. Like any good study this one sets out an objective definition for the things it measures. But the way it defines performance cars looking for   with big power and torque numbers to see if they correlate with undesirable investing behavior doesn?t map all that well on to the array of fast automotive offerings currently available to the   managers of the world. Now happens to be a golden age for high performance  . A decade ago only the clunky and exotic Maserati Quattroporte filled a market niche that Porsche Aston Martin and even Dodge with its Charger Hellcat now compete in. So while ?I know it when I see it? makes a bad legal definition of smut because it?s too subjective it would be fascinating to see the study conducted based on a definition of ?performance car? derived from polling the opinions of a group of automotive journalists and car obsessives. It seems likely the study?s results would be even more pronounced. Still regardless of exactly how the cars are categorized the lesson is clear. Before putting their trust in financial professionals consumers should find out what those professionals drive.
459,73302,?Repeal and Delay? Won?t Prevent Obamacare Repeal Chaos,Atlantic,Vann R. Newkirk II,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Over the next few weeks Republicans will probably vote to repeal Obamacare. Though Republicans and vice   Mike Pence are huddling to come up with replacement plans the general framework of action over the immediate term seems clear. Republicans will likely delay its   so as to not immediately cancel millions of plans and ?create a transition and bridge so that no one is left out in the cold? as per Speaker Ryan. Barring defections Democrats have little power to stop them. There?s one big problem with this approach however. While the ?repeal and delay? tactic seems like a way to keep people from becoming suddenly uninsured or having to make inconvenient changes ?  or to keep kicking the can down the road ?  in reality the mere announcement of a   repeal or pledge to end government support for   markets could cause severe disruptions in how those markets operate. And those disruptions could mean turmoil for millions of people. Obama: The Ocean President  The secondary currency of any insurance market is risk ?  or the amount plans can be expected to pay in claims for each beneficiary. Originally insurers hedged against risk by finding healthy patients and charging sicker patients more or denying them coverage altogether. Obamacare effectively eliminated many of those hedges by creating qualifying health plans by removing lifetime spending caps and by prohibiting companies from refusing to insure based on   conditions bans. In order to make the health plans work work and entice health insurance companies to participate in the health insurance exchanges Obamacare mandates healthier people to join and offset sicker people?s costs and also uses federal money to offsetting risky bets in several different ways. Those shopping for plans on the exchanges are often inherently risky bets and only federal funding and the promise of more such funding in the future keeps insurers insuring them. Even in 2016 before Donald Trump?s presidency became viable and the threat of an Obamacare repeal became real the exchanges had grown increasingly unstable and brittle. The administration had difficulty in attracting younger healthier people to sign up so enrollees were sicker and riskier than expected. Although stakeholders expected risk to be high as the country adjusted to a   healthcare paradigm and the individual mandate pushed stragglers into exchanges Congress later authorized lower payments than expected to offset that risk. The   premium increases of exchange plans and the withdrawal of major insurers like Aetna were signs of this inherent instability. Although they are certainly fixable problems fixing them requires money which requires action by Congress. Though some of this instability can be attributed to hype from insurers seeking to maximize government subsidies and payments to offset risk several firms do run in the red now with the expectation that they?ll be in good position to make money when the market settles down. What?s the incentive for them to continue to insure people if they believe the market will no longer exist ?  or if they believe that the tax credits in a Republican replacement plan are less than what they receive now? Insurance plans have to decide by May of 2017 if they?ll participate in the exchanges and it might not be a surprise to see insurers with smaller enrollee bases or higher losses bow out. Also those plans that do stay can pass on the costs of increased uncertainty in the markets in the form of increased premiums which would cost the federal government and enrollees even more money. At MarketWatch former   executive J. B. Silvers explains how this might all work in practice: Some in Congress seem to think that passing the ?repeal? part immediately but delaying its implementation for two or three years will somehow leave everything as it is now. But this naive notion misses the fact that the riskiness of the Obamacare individual insurance exchange markets will have been ramped up to such a level that continuing makes no sense. Even if a company reaches   in the ?delay? years it will lose when the repeal is effective. If the premium subsidies now available to   enrollees go away immediately and the mandate to sign up for an insurance plan disappears then the number of people purchasing individual policies on the exchanges will drop like a rock. In fact it is clear that even debating this scenario is likely to be   since insurers must decide on their participation for 2018 by the late spring of 2017. Look for many to leave then. A plan to repeal and delay would also likely have some effects on the individual mandate to purchase insurance. If that plan immediately eliminates the mandate the final lever to maintain the health of exchange risk pools evaporates and there will be much less impetus for healthier younger people to participate in them. Even if the plan phases the mandate out over time news of a repeal might be easily misconstrued as eliminating the mandate which could still spur millions of healthy people to leave the exchanges and penalize them at tax time next year for doing so. At the same time even the rumor of a repeal can send millions of sicker people into the exchanges to receive some kind of vital services before the well runs dry which are bound by law to cover them. In fact this may already have happened. As long as an indefinite purgatory between repeal and replacement exists adverse selection will be impossible to fix as would be the ?death spiral. ? The   scenario would be the   withdrawal of insurers from markets and the inversion of risk pyramids with sicker and sicker patients seeking coverage while they can. Without available insurers or a public option people without employer coverage or who make too much to qualify for Medicaid might just not have any insurance to buy. If Congress and state governments don?t actively enforce ?rate review? and   ratio rules that give states oversight over large premium increases and mandate that insurance plans spend a certain percentage of premiums on healthcare insurers could enter markets that don?t have plans and raise premiums for vulnerable people who need insurance most. Alternatively   insurers ?  which already profit on the mandate despite providing barebones services that don?t qualify as full plans ?  could continue to fill in the gaps. Millions of people in the exchanges may have to change insurance or enter the ranks of the uninsured. And though the delay may not immediately affect people with employer coverage or public coverage downstream challenges for insurers in exchanges could affect the products they offer for those markets. None of this would be good politically for Republicans who already have to contend with a voter base that actually kind of likes having insurance. Compare that scenario to the political damage that Democrats suffered in the 2016 elections over much less dire and   problems. Republicans could pin these woes on Obamacare itself but then their inability to fix those woes despite campaigning on promises to do just that could come back to haunt them. As conservative   American Enterprise Institute reports the fact that Republicans are aware of the destabilizing effect that a delay might cause and intend to build a reform in increments indicates that there isn?t really a plan in place. But the longer the delay goes the more political capital will have to be expended in fixing the issues that it causes. A piecemeal plan with a delay could also exacerbate the instabilities in the marketplace and continue to widen gaps in the current healthcare system. The market risk grows with each day without a clear picture of what comes next and many people who have children lose jobs lose spouses or have other serious life events in the interim will be placed at the mercy of a volatile market where   plans might evaporate subsidies may suddenly dry up or death spirals may collapse entire markets altogether. What comes next for them?
460,73303,How Design Thinking Became a Buzzword at School,Atlantic,Jessica Lahey,1/4/2017,2017,1,,At a recent teaching conference in Richmond Virginia a session on ?design thinking? in education drew a capacity crowd. Two   teachers demonstrated how they had used the concept to plan and execute an   project in which students were asked to develop a hypothetical city or town given factors such as population geography the environment and financial resources. The teachers in the audience were enchanted by the details of the project and if the photographs in the presentation were any indication the students who participated in the lesson enjoyed it too. The presenting teachers were bubbling over with enthusiasm for what they saw as the potential inherent in teaching design thinking. Many of the teachers in attendance were flummoxed however. As we filed out of the room and headed toward our next sessions I overheard one woman remark to another that while the   project looked like something she?d like to try in her own classroom ?I think I missed something. I still don?t understand what design thinking is. Do you?? The other teacher shook her head and said ?I think it?s a curriculum but I?m not really sure. ? The Common   Tool That?s Banned in College Confusion around the precise definition of design thinking is understandable said Neil Stevenson the executive portfolio director at IDEO Chicago one of the   purveyors of design thinking. ?Design thinking isn?t one thing? he told me in a phone interview ?but a bundle of mindsets and philosophies all wrapped up in one term which obviously has the potential to lead to ambiguity and misunderstanding. ? While Stevenson spent plenty of time talking around a definition ?  explaining mindsets the nature of creativity and the evolution of design ?  even convincing him to offer a brief definition proved difficult. Finally Stevenson outlined what he sees as the foundational aspects of design thinking as it relates to educators: First he emphasized design thinking starts with empathy. When designing anything meant to be used by another person ?  whether that?s a lesson curriculum classroom layout or an imaginary city ?  the designer must understand what that person (an ?? in design lingo) needs. In the case of the   project for example the students can?t just design a pretty building they must think about the needs of the people who will live there as well as the available resources the budget and the impact that building will have on the surrounding landscape. ?The   philosophy requires the designer to put his or her ego to the side and seek to meet the unmet needs both rational and emotional of the user? Stevenson explained. Once the student designers have gathered all their research together they must organize and make sense of it all. Again in the case of the   project after the students have gathered interviews and research about the needs of their city?s future residents students must figure out what to do with all that information. If for example the future residents? top priorities include affordability and opulence the student designer is going to have to find a way to integrate the residents? conflicting needs. Finally design thinking requires designers to generate ideas ?  lots of ideas ?  and prototype them. In order for this part of the process to work students and teachers must be comfortable with failure. For many students particularly those who want to look smart this phase can be frustrating. ?People tend to come up with an idea early on and know that this idea is it the perfect idea and get emotionally invested in that one thing. Then when their perfect idea fails they fall apart? Stevenson said. Design thinking forces students to keep their minds open to try out lots of ideas early in the process before they let their egos or emotions get too invested in just one. There will be a time to put spitballing aside of course. Once ideas have been prototyped and tested students begin to work toward one effective final solution ?  an end product that can be assessed presented displayed or put to work in their classroom or community. The beauty of the design process proponents say is that the value of the experience does not lie solely in the end product. Learning happens throughout the process from the early research phase to the final presentation. This allows students and teachers to focus on what?s most important in learning: the process rather than the product. One scene from the film Apollo 13 provides a great illustration of the   process. After Apollo 13 is crippled by an explosion the astronauts are stranded in the lunar module. The air filters in the lunar module are failing so the engineers at NASA must find a way to make a square filter fit into a round hole using only the materials available to the astronauts. The engineers find a solution through design thinking: by understanding the needs and resources of the astronauts organizing the resources available on the lunar module then working together to develop and prototype many ideas. The ultimate solution may not have been pretty but it was creative and it was effective. Their design saved the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts. This sort of    formulaic approach to creative   was revolutionary and counterintuitive when it was first developed in reaction to the launch of Sputnik in 1957. When Russia leapfrogged ahead of the rest of the world in the space race the U. S. needed to respond with a rapid and radical acceleration in technological innovation. The process of design thinking emerged as an effort to encourage all scientists ?  even the least creative most inflexible thinkers ?  to be novel brave and innovative in their  . Historically creativity has been portrayed as a mysterious elusive force ?  a gift from the gods or the muses. Creativity can?t be summoned the thinking goes let alone taught to the mentally inflexible unimaginative   masses. Design thinking upends that perception and assumes that anyone can be a creative  . At its best design thinking incorporates   teaching techniques such as   inquiry and collaborative   and dovetails nicely with   learning curricula that emphasize interpersonal skills such as collaboration and empathy. And the end result of a   project is often a tangible product such as a model city a robot or a better mousetrap.  It?s no surprise then that many educators are eager to adopt design thinking as a way to plan their own teaching and as a strategy for helping their students learn through solving   problems. The popularity of design thinking however might be precisely what?s contributing to the confusion I witnessed in Virginia says Stevenson: It?s been extremely gratifying for all of us practicing design to see the ideas taken on by so many people. There?s a downside though which is that when something becomes popular now suddenly everyone wants to learn it and lots and lots of people will spring up and teach it. For the sake of communication we tend to define design thinking as A followed by B followed by C but in doing this we are guilty of oversimplifying. As teachers seek to learn more about design thinking and its application in their classrooms conference sessions and certificate programs have emerged to accommodate demand. Stanford?s   and IDEO offer two popular courses but there are many flavors colors and brands of design thinking for educators to choose from. In other words the lack of a clear definition makes explaining evaluating and studying design thinking a challenge. And some teachers at that conference in Virginia ?  myself included ?  were skeptical and attended the   session to better understand whether the concept is actually an effective learning strategy or simply another education trend gone viral despite scant objective data regarding its effectiveness for learning. When executed with a clear understanding of its purpose as a method for fostering empathy creativity and innovation design thinking can be a powerful tool for learning and change. If it is hastily and inexpertly implemented by educators with a weak or incomplete understanding of its principles however it is likely to be a waste of energy and precious classroom time. Design thinking like Carol Dweck?s work on fixed and growth mindsets and Angela Duckworth?s research on grit are best understood in context as a complex and nuanced approach to learning rather than a checklist of executable tasks. Dweck was so alarmed by the rampant oversimplification of fixed and growth mindsets that she wrote an article for Edutopia to clear up common misconceptions about her work. Just as Dweck?s work can?t be conveyed adequately in a Life Hack infographic and Duckworth?s research is apt to be misunderstood when reduced to a listicle design thinking seems likely to fail as an educational tool when communicated in terms of ?Five Simple Steps. ? Mindsets grit and design thinking are all victims of their own massive popularity and in the rush to incorporate these concepts into existing lesson plans have sometimes been reduced to checklist items on teachers? overcrowded   lists. When treated as a classroom culture however rather than an action design thinking (as well as mindset and grit) may revolutionize the way teachers and students think about failure creative   and teamwork. Ultimately design thinking is not a curriculum advocates like Stevenson say but a process for   a strategy to elicit creativity rooted in empathy and comfort with failure. Teachers can use design thinking to create a classroom layout that conforms to the needs of their students they say or to plan lessons that will work best for the students in a given school or classroom. Entire school districts are embracing design thinking to create spaces and curricula around the intellectual and emotional needs of their students. Teachers are also helping students use design thinking to apply what they?ve learned to   problems such as the   project described by those   teachers in Virginia. While there is not a lot of data to support any particular brand of design thinking as an effective teaching or learning strategy the key elements of design thinking will be familiar to any teacher   in the basics of effective teaching: start with empathy move ego to the side and support students in the process of failing often and early on their way to learning.
461,73304,Obama: The Ocean President ,Atlantic,Ed Yong,1/4/2017,2017,1,,In August 1961 Barack Obama was born in Honolulu Hawaii thousands of miles from the American mainland. He spent 14 of his first 18 years on those islands bodysurfing off Sandy Beach Park surrounded by the expansive blue of the Pacific. He later moved inland to Los Angeles New York Chicago and eventually the White House. But he never lost his childhood connection to the sea. When he leaves the Oval Office this month he will have safeguarded more of the ocean than any other president and increased the amount of protected waters around the U. S. by four times.* His administration has also worked to improve American fisheries clamp down on illegal fishing and create national policies for protecting the oceans. Such measures are vital at a time when the oceans are imperiled by many threats including overfishing acidification pollution and climate change. ?We don?t see the effects of climate change every single day with our own eyes? Obama said last September at a State Department conference in Washington D. C. ?We just see this great big ocean ?  we assume that it?s too big to be wrecked.  It?s easy as a consequence to dismiss the urgency of the challenge. ? ?When you look at what he has done in terms of ocean protection it?s really remarkable and partly because it was so unexpected? says Jean Flemma a former policy advisor at the U. S. House of Representatives. ?When Obama was elected he was known for being good on environmental issues. But I don?t think anyone thought at the outset: Here?s the president who?s going to be the ocean president. ? ?This administration has made the ocean a centerpiece for international diplomacy? says Jane Lubchenco a marine ecologist and former administrator of NOAA. ?They used to be out of sight out of mind. The only people who would talk about ocean issues were science ministers or fishery ministers. Now when the President talks to other heads of state oceans are often on the agenda. ? ?People tend to make issues like this partisan? she adds. But many of Obama?s actions to improve ocean health ?have their roots in previous Republican administrations and have strong bipartisan support in Congress. ? And Obama himself took a while to wet his conservation feet. In January 2013 the Center for American Progress criticized him for having protected less public land than any of the four preceding presidents and for having leased 2. 5 times as much acreage to oil and gas companies for drilling. Since then there?s been a dramatic  . Under Obama?s administration the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has expanded several marine sanctuaries and created the first new ones in 15 years. He himself has created or expanded several national monuments using the Antiquities Act ?  a 1906 law passed by Teddy Roosevelt which allows presidents to unilaterally protect areas of land without congressional approval. Obama has used this power 29 times most recently to create the Bears Ears and Gold Butte monuments just last week. These and most of the other monuments are on land. But the biggest ones by far are in the ocean. In September 2014 Obama took the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument which George W. Bush had created five years earlier and expanded it  . The monument comprises seven disparate U. S.  islands and atolls. It?s a bustling haven for sharks groupers whales dolphins turtles and seabirds and is now completely closed off to drilling mining and commercial (but not recreational) fishing. Covering 490 000 square miles it?s three times the size of California and bigger than all the   national parks combined. For two years it was the world?s largest marine reserve until Obama smashed his own record in August 2016. Working off another Bush legacy he quadrupled the size of Hawaii?s Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument to 583 000 square miles ?  twice the size of Texas. The area houses over 7 000 marine species including many found nowhere else in the world. Among them are the endangered Hawaiian monk seal a ghostly octopus dubbed Casper and a newly discovered fish named Tosanoides obama. Animals aside the monument also contains the wrecks of five aircraft carriers that were sunk during World War II and what Native Hawaiians see as a boundary between the living world and the spiritual one. ?Obama not only conserved a really unique ecosystem but also a part of our history and an area with very important cultural links? says Kris Sarri who works at the Department of the Interior. In September Obama added the first marine monument in the Atlantic. Situated off the coast of Cape Cod the    zone includes   corals and   sperm whales three underwater canyons that are deeper than the Grand Canyon and four dormant undersea volcanoes that are taller than the Appalachians.   Obama has been even busier in the final months of his term. In October he was reportedly instrumental in persuading a reticent Chinese government to join the U. S. and 23 other governments in setting up the world?s largest marine protected area in the Ross Sea off Antarctica. In December as my colleague Robinson Meyer reported he established an ?indefinite? ban on oil and gas drilling in virtually the entire   stretch of the Arctic Ocean as well as parts of the Atlantic. In the same month he created a 112 000 square mile ?climate resilience area? off the west coast of Alaska ?  a region that hosts vast numbers of migrating mammals like bowhead whales belugas and walruses. His executive order maintains bans against   fishing adds partials prohibitions against oil and gas exploration and gives indigenous Native Alaskan communities a greater voice in managing the area. ?Any time you are willing to set aside an area for the health of the environment it?s an act of courage? says Jeff Watters director of government relations at the Ocean Conservancy. ?Conservation will always make people upset. But the choices that Obama and Bush made were made after extensive public comment and feedback. It?s not like they just came in the dead of midnight. ? Indeed after protests from fishing groups Obama decided to allow lobster and red crab fisheries to operate in the Atlantic monument for seven more years. He also pulled back on creating a second monument at the kelp forests of Cashes Ledge in New England. For many critics that?s not enough. They argue that the Antiquities Act and the monuments that result from it represent a gross overreach of Executive Branch authority. Rob Bishop a Utah representative and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources described it as ?the most evil Act ever invented? to a group of land managers. ?If anyone here likes the Antiquities Act the way it is written die? he added. He and others have repeatedly tried to weaken the act or repeal it entirely. Such complaints aren?t new. A miner challenged the Antiquities Act in 1920 claiming that Roosevelt had overstepped the mark in establishing a large chunk of the Grand Canyon as a monument. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Roosevelt?s favor and in doing so set an important precedent. But some say the time is right to set a new one and are looking to Donald Trump to make the historic move of revoking existing monuments once he takes office. Speaking to The Salt Lake Tribune Bishop said that he had had ?positive and encouraging? talks with the Trump transition team about this. ?However some legal analyses have concluded that the Antiquities Act does not authorize the President to repeal proclamations and that the President also lacks implied authority to do so? wrote Alexandra Wyatt an attorney at the Congressional Research Service. Or as my colleague Robinson Meyer said ?The president can giveth land to conservation but he or she cannot taketh it away. ? Any attempt to do so would likely meet lengthy legal challenges. Trump might not have any appetite for such battles. Earlier this year he told CBS News that he doesn?t like the idea of handing federal lands to states. ?I want to keep the lands great and you don?t know what the state is going to do? he said. ?This is magnificent land. And we have to be great stewards of this land. ? Speaking to  Field  Stream magazine he said ?I am for energy exploration as long as we don?t do anything to damage the land. And right now we don?t need too much ?  there?s a lot of energy. ? And in a   speech he claimed that he would follow the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt and ?conserve and protect our beautiful natural resources for the next generation including protecting lands. ? Such promises will ultimately count for little if his administration maintains its denial of climate change.   carbon emissions are warming and making the oceans more acidic if the U. S. reneges on its commitment to reducing such emissions marine life will eventually suffer. But in the short term protected waters can help its residents to cope with climate change by removing extra stresses like drilling fishing and noise pollution. ?We have good evidence that protected areas are more resilient and recover faster? says Lubchenco. That?s good news for people who depend on the sea for their livelihood. In sanctuaries and monuments depleted populations of fish can recover grow and reproduce. ?Fish aren?t like mammals as females get bigger they make lots more eggs so if you allow fish to get big and old you get a lot more babies? explains Rebecca Goldburg director of ocean science at the Pew Charitable Trusts. And since those babies can travel over long distances protected areas act as conveyor belts that continually seed nearby fisheries with fresh stock. Historically most of the ocean was effectively protected by dint of being remote and inaccessible. Now our technology allows us to fish mine and drill everywhere. And the sad truth is that even the unprecedentedly large areas that Obama has protected combined with similar reserves set up by other nations comprise just a few percent of the total ocean. It?s a dramatic increase from a decade ago but still ?just a drop in the bucket? says Lubchenco. ?Scientists think we?ll need upwards of 30 percent. ? ?While it is our oceans? contours that shape our coastlines it is what we decide and do here that will shape our oceans? future? Obama once said. ?I spent my childhood on those shores looking out over the endless ocean and was humbled by it. And I know that in a contest between us and the oceans eventually the oceans will win one way or the other.  So it?s us that has to adapt.  Not the other way around. ? *  This article originally stated that Obama ?increased the amount of protected waters around the U. S. by 20 times? which is true for the continental U. S. The increase for the nation?s waters however is just  . We regret the error.
462,73305,Mistakes in ?Paleo? Eating ,Atlantic,James Hamblin,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Advertising is screaming at us: New year new you. New new new. Everything will be better when it?s new. The old you was probably great but it?s harder to sell things to people who honestly believe that. The most common January undertaking in that quest is dietary ?  shifting the actual molecules that fuel everything we do. Most of us will fail to meaningfully change and then feel only more inadequate in that failure. We fail because absurd goals can never be maintained and because sometimes our own bodies (partly the way we were born but mostly the way we?ve trained them to demand constant supplies of simple carbohydrates and insulin) make it almost impossible not to fail ?  to live without feeling deprived and hungry and joyless. Maybe most importantly many people fail when they don?t truly believe in what they?re doing. The gratification of sugar is immediate and the idea of a paralyzing stroke decades hence is remote. It seems there are more important things to worry about right now. One solution might be to think beyond yourself. I?m reminded of that because this week the good people at Bon Appetit magazine tweeted a story under the headline ?Don?t Make These Common Mistakes When Going Paleo. ? (Tell me I?m making mistakes and I will click every time.) The ?Paleo? approach to eating is in brief using evolutionary history to inform consumption. Some mistakes described in the article differed from what I think are the most important to consider ?  for Paleo or most any diet. Their first piece of advice is to avoid eating too much saturated fat. That?s a contentious claim packed into a paragraph of a culinary magazine. Books have been written on the subject and many nutrition experts have come to disagree that the weight of evidence supports limiting saturated fat. (Within reason ?  don?t test them and try to subsist on lard alone.) The Paleo movement itself arose in step with the realization over the past two decades that saturated fat had been wrongly blamed by some experts as the central dietary culprit in heart disease. While other experts disagree that saturated fat intake should be unlimited (and some research has found that substituting polyunsaturated fats can be beneficial) it?s unclear to many that strict limits are prudent. I?m not convinced it?s worthwhile for most people to think about saturated fat at all ?  to avoid it or to gorge on it. So here are what I see as more pressing mistakes related to Paleo and the opportunities that those mistakes present. Eating in a way that?s not sustainable for the planet Speaking of packing entire books into one paragraph:   animal agriculture has become a primary driver of climate change. We are eating and producing much more meat than ever before. The human population is on pace to hit 10 billion by the middle of the century that?s 10 times as many people as there were in 1800. When we find a way to grow delicious red meat in petri dishes then we can discuss exactly how much is healthy to eat. For now the only way forward for our species seems to be to consider meat as something closer to a delicacy. Forgetting fiber Of all the ?probiotics? on the market one of the few with actual evidence that it serves our microbes well is plant fiber. Fiber is the carbohydrate that humans can?t digest yet we?ve long known that people who eat   diets tend to be healthier. Among multiple studies with similar results one with 40 000 subjects found that a   diet came with a   lower than average risk of heart disease. Fiber also seems to protect against metabolic syndrome. One of the mechanisms behind these benefits appears to be that fiber essentially feeds the microbes in our guts encouraging diverse populations. Those microbes are implicated in a vast array of illnesses and wellbeing. A diet heavy on meat and dairy is necessarily lower on fiber.   In that light the idea of ? ? is an interesting one. Loosely defined it could mean eating minimally processed   diets. If a flaw in veganism is that some people think they can drink juice and eat white bread all day and be healthy that might be sustainable for the planet but not good for you.   (again loosely defined lest we descend into madness trying to discern the plant varieties this would include) might work as a rule of thumb that generally keeps us focused on the sorts of foods that promote health. Rejecting the idea that technology can improve our lives The basic idea behind Paleo is that humans evolved under certain circumstances over millennia and then those circumstances changed tremendously in the last century and our bodies did not keep pace. We find ourselves sedentary and overfed on amalgamations that distort our body?s expectations of ?food. ? There?s almost no doubt these changes underlie epidemics of obesity and cardiovascular disease but it?s easy to take that reasoning too far ?  basically to adopt a worldview in which all modern food technology is evil. It seems clear that the future of health research will involve anthropological study of our history in determining how we (and our microbes) evolved to process and prosper from food and where we?ve gone wrong in recent decades. As we come to better understand that history it?s important not to lose focus on the fact that for all its problems our modern food system has us living longer and less deprived than centuries past. The challenge is striking balance. Telling people all about how you?re ?going Paleo? unless explicitly asked to do so Other people?s diets are no more interesting than their sleep habits or their children. Breaking into a screed about your own diet shows contempt for the listener. It?s like talking about how you went to the dentist or about something you were going to post on Facebook but didn?t. Being hypocritical Take for instance this advice from the Bon Appetit article: It?s a   to plan a week?s worth of dinners but don?t forget about breakfast lunch and snacks. Kenzie Swanhart [author of a Paleo cookbook] brings raw vegetables like carrot sticks and peppers with guacamole to work. She?s also a fan of homemade plantain chips and   granola bars. Those all sound like fine things to eat but the philosophy behind them is disjointed. The ? ? part is based on the idea that our bodies didn?t evolve to eat grains (which were not a significant part of human diets before the dawn of agriculture).   books have also been written about this citing evidence selectively. But more compelling to me whole grains have consistently shown to be parts of the diets of the   healthiest people. (Also is it a   to plan a week?s worth of dinners?) If you choose to avoid grains because they weren?t part of an ancestral diet then it?s difficult to justify any granola bars plantain chips and guacamole. Unless you can point to some ancient people who ate all three of those things.  The point is if you?re going to go around talking about ?going Paleo? for whatever reason ?  ritual   adventure ?  it?s strange to be militantly inflexible about rules that are barely more than arbitrary. Lacking a meaningful reason for what you?re doing Changing the way we eat is a major change. It will involve multiple decisions every day. Presumably our old habits existed for reasons ?  convenience enjoyment availability cost marketing etc. Modifying the habits that these conditions created means hard work and requires dedication to a cause. I?m not convinced that concern for the health of our bodies years in the future is sufficient. I?m not even sure the promise of modifying our appearances is enough. The neurologist Viktor Frankl wrote in Man?s Search for Meaning that the key is to avoid the temptation to pursue happiness ?  like that being sold to us through all of the   deals ?  but to pursue meaning. Piles of research have shown that a sense of purpose is a central to long healthy life. There?s purpose to be had in how we eat ?  in how conscientious we can be how minimally we can disrupt the world for those that will come after us and those working to produce and procure our food. I think this is a sustainable and worthy resolution for a healthier way to eat if you?re intent on making one. It works for the mind and body at once and most importantly not just our own.
463,73306,The Republicans Who Want Trump to Fight Climate Change,Atlantic,Kate Aronoff,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Not everyone interested in curbing climate change is tearing their hair out about Donald Trump?s election. Though the   seems to be packing his administration with climate deniers and fossil fuel industry veterans a small unconventional band of environmentalists sees potential. ?We hope? says Bob Inglis ?that Donald Trump sees an opportunity to complete the sentence this way: Richard Nixon went to China Bill Clinton signed welfare reform and Donald Trump did climate change. ? In the last several years Inglis ?  a former Congressman from South Carolina ?  has emerged as a spokesperson of sorts for ?the ? a suite of think tanks activists and politicos making the case for a   approach to environmentalism grounded in conservative values. He now serves as the Executive Director of RepublicEn a small advocacy outfit of   ?energy optimists? keen to dispel rumors that the GOP is the province of climate denialism. Inglis?s optimism notwithstanding   activists have ample reason to fear a Trump administration. The  ?s pick to run the EPA has spent years challenging the agency in court. And his Secretary of State nominee the former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson could green light new   pipelines like the Keystone XL along with new partnerships between oil companies from Houston to Moscow. A previously squashed $500 billion Arctic oil deal between Exxon and Rosneft a   Russian oil firm might well be on the table again if Trump lifts   sanctions against the country. For Inglis and his colleagues at RepublicEN though the cabinet picks causing other greens to lose sleep have been welcome additions. ?If Rex Tillerson led Exxon Mobil away from the disputation of climate science perhaps he can lead the Administration away from disputation too? Inglis says and he takes Tillerson?s support for a carbon tax as an encouraging sign. When it comes to climate action Inglis adds the ?environmental left? ?  encompassing everyone from Al Gore to   activists ?  have been steering the conversation about climate change for too long. It?s time to ?let ExxonMobil drive? he says. Inglis might seem out of step with the climate movement?s increasingly   bent defined by efforts like   divestment and the battle against the Dakota Access pipeline. But members of the   see little contradiction between   companies?   and a   future. Like other members of the   Inglis believes that efficient markets are the ultimate problem solver and he has a general skepticism about all but the most basic of regulations. ?The essence of [the  ] is all about internalizing negative externalities? Inglis says referencing the hidden expenses of carbon?s seepage into the atmosphere. He says that polluters are ?socializing their soot and climate costs. ? By making them pay and stripping out all energy subsidies the thinking goes firms will shift their business models accordingly weeding out wasteful fuels making the Paris Agreement and Obama?s Clean Power Plan superfluous. ?Our view of the Clean Power Plan is that it?s precisely the worst way to deal with climate change? Inglis explains. UN agreements and regulatory pushes Inglis argues represent the kind of policies which keep conservatives out of the conversation on climate because they are both too complicated and too confrontational. ?I think the path in is mostly through the business community where unlikely partners could really step forward and say ?There?s a free enterprise solution to this. Don?t give us regulations. Don?t try to tell us how to run our business. Just internalize the negative externality and we will deal with it?? he says. The holy grail of Inglis?s brand of   is a ?   ? carbon tax. This kind of pricing mechanism offers a more elegant solution to the   than the patchwork of regulations involved in Obama?s landmark climate rule wherein each state arrives at its own plan. Greens across the political spectrum have long backed versions of a carbon tax as part of a broader slate of   policies some proposals for which would see dividends given out directly to taxpayers or put toward investments in clean energy. What?s unique about the   position on the tax is their view that it should act as the centerpiece of a climate plan as opposed to one component among many   and regulatory measures. In contrast when Bernie Sanders and his ?environmental left? ilk advocate for pricing carbon they tend also to favor putting hard limits on polluters? ability to spit greenhouse gases into the air. Key too to the   is swapping a carbon tax out for others ?  say income or corporate taxes ?  rather than adding the revenue to government coffers. ?You put a tax on things that you want less of? Inglis says while allowing the price signal to drive   firms toward natural gas and renewable energy. Importers to the U. S. would also be forced to account for the carbon costs of goods produced abroad. Carbon taxes don?t have the best track record. Norway set a reasonably high carbon tax way back in 1991 yet the country?s emissions fell by just 2. 3 percent from 1990 to 1999. In British Columbia where a tax was implemented in 2008 modest emissions reductions have been traced back to the fallout from the Great Recession rather than the tax itself. It?s not clear how a new tax would affect corporate behavior. Oil majors have been factoring the likelihood of a price on carbon into their   financial planning for some time. Exxon first started accounting for a tax in 2007 setting its estimations for a price as high as $80 per ton in some regions. The company?s own spokesperson told the Houston Chronicle in 2016 that curbing warming to a 1. 6 degree target ?  ?well below two degrees? per the Paris Agreement?s text ?  would drive the cost of carbon up to $2000 per ton far beyond the level set out in any proposal currently on the table. A failed carbon tax measure in Washington state for example would have started the tax at just $10 per ton in 2017 and gradually scaled up to $100 by  . Among the countries already taxing carbon Australia?s fee is the equivalent of $23 per metric ton. Chile?s will be set at just $5 per ton when it takes effect in 2018 and apply to just 55 percent of emissions. Sweden has one of the highest carbon prices at $150 per ton. It doesn?t apply however to the country?s electric power providers and major industries pay about half of the standard tax. Exxon?s Alan Jeffers affirmed the company?s commitment to a   carbon tax in an email to The Atlantic. Among the state and federal proposals the company had studied Jeffers wrote ?The most significant common shortcoming is their failure to   existing greenhouse gas regulations. The   issue is important because a   carbon tax that replaces the existing regime of emissions regulations would be a beneficial policy rationalization. ? In simpler terms an   carbon tax shouldn?t just avoid regulations. It should dismantle them and place as little strain as possible on the company?s operations. Exxon has gone so far as to back the Paris Agreement and its ambitious warming target. Even so regulatory caps on warming ?  and strict ones at that ?  may be the only path to meeting them. A recent study from Oil Change International estimates that nearly 70 percent of   coal oil and natural gas reserves ?  not counting the ones   firms are keen to start mining ?  have to stay buried in perpetuity for a reasonable chance of limiting warming to 2 degrees celsius the ?guardrail? of acceptable warming that the international community agreed to in Paris. To do that the historical record seems to favor regulatory action over price signals alone. In contrast to British Columbia?s 5. 3 percent reduction   Ontario?s climate plan was able to scale down emissions by nearly twenty percent over a similar time frame. In large part they did it by phasing out and then banning   power plants. Asked if climate policy might need to pose a threat to oil industry profits at some point Inglis suggested that threat would come instead from Tesla Elon Musk?s luxury electric car company. Inglis reasons that if fossil fuels truly are inefficient the better product will win out on an open market. But it?s not clear that Tesla will win in the mass market any time soon. The Model 3 the company?s first ?mass market? car intended to be more affordable than its others will be released next year and start at $35 000. More than 56 percent of American families meanwhile have less than $1000 in the bank. Eli Lehrer is another member of the   looking to harness the power of the free market to save the planet. Back in 2012 Lehrer helped lead an exodus of insurance wonks out of the conservative and notoriously climate   Heartland Institute. The final straw for him at Heartland was their sponsorship of a series of billboards likening those who believe in climate change to the likes of Charles Manson and Osama bin Laden. As an insurance analyst trained to assess risk Lehrer could no longer square his research interests with his employer?s aggressive stance against climate science. He now heads R Street another think tank produced out of the  . Even if a carbon tax fails to bring down emissions he says ?it?s still good tax policy. ? In 2016 the GOP?s climate politics are more complicated than they might look at first glance with growing divides between voters and elected officials. Along with Inglis and Lehrer 54 percent of Republicans now believe that the climate is changing and that humankind has played a hand in it. By contrast just 14 of the 247 Republicans in the House of Representatives signed on to the Gibson Resolution stating the urgency of climate change and the body?s commitment to addressing it. As Lehrer notes even if Republicans? base is starting to believe in climate change it is still a long way off from becoming a top line issue. For Republicans in fact climate change was this year?s least important issue according to Gallup. In spite of the polling Lehrer sees   efforts at a carbon tax as ?very likely in the next four to eight years. ? If there is to be progress in bringing down emissions under Trump at the federal level though Lehrer predicts it will come via policies that have very little to do with the climate outright. ?Some of the things that the administration seems to have said it will do seem to be pretty good from a climate change perspective? Lehrer says ?in particular  ?    increased natural gas development support for nuclear power and pipelines. ? Natural gas development he and the American Petroleum Institute argue has been key to bringing down emissions in the United States. Yet while natural gas emits relatively little CO2 scientists say that fracking?s low carbon cost is overshadowed by the amount of methane the process spews into the atmosphere. (As a greenhouse gas methane is about twenty times as potent as carbon dioxide.) As for pipelines Lehrer contends they are a safer and more   means of transporting fossil fuels as compared to train lines. Still building pipelines in the first place requires that there be fresh batches of oil to flow through them which means more greenhouse gases. ?Can I predict what he?s going to do? No I don?t think anybody can? Lehrer wrote of the   in an email to The Atlantic. ?I would not be totally surprised if he were to give some speech announcing that [climate change] was a major crisis announcing a new Manhattan Project to deal with it. And I?d be equally unsurprised if he reiterated his comment that it?s a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. ?
464,73307,Trump Might Be Thinking About a Moon Base,Atlantic,David Brown ,1/4/2017,2017,1,,Last week upon leaving the  ?s office Douglas Brinkley a historian and conservationist reported that Trump ?was very interested in a man going to the moon. ? Before that point the entirety of Trump?s utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences: ?Honestly I think NASA is wonderful!? and ?Right now we have bigger problems  ?     We?ve got to fix our potholes. ? Brinkley?s remark suggests he might be thinking about a moon base an idea   by Newt Gingrich one of Trump?s advisers. The constitution of his transition landing team at NASA which includes lunar advocates would seem to bear this out. The principal arguments for a moon base involve digging mines and building fuel depots. Though the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly   it only takes a few days to reach from Earth. If the U. S. decides that the goal of human spaceflight should be to gather resources the moon and its quarry of   will be a compelling target. The isotope is extremely rare on Earth because of our magnetosphere. The moon has no such protection and for billions of years it has collected the stuff by way of an unyielding fusillade from solar winds. There is an estimated 1. 1 million metric tons of   on the moon. A mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor we could shovel it into our nuclear power plants for centuries to come. There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface. A telescope for example built on the far side of the moon and thus free of Earth?s ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe. Chris Carberry CEO and founder of Explore Mars a nonprofit Mars advocacy group argues that far greater opportunities exist on Mars and that a return to the moon might delay Mars settlement by decades. Mars has carbon nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen ?  everything a colony needs to be  . With those ingredients you can do everything from manufacturing plastics to cultivating the soil. In other words you can build a base on the moon but a civilization on Mars. Moreover Carberry says that the red planet has never been in a better position politically culturally or scientifically. ?Right now we have an unprecedented level of support for Mars exploration? Carberry says. ?Frankly it would be foolish to throw that away. There?s a huge amount of support on Capitol Hill. The Senate just passed a transition bill with the strongest Mars language ever put into legislation. The House did a previous authorization bill with very strong Mars language as well. There are many years of bipartisan support for Mars ?  also for the moon but the strongest emphasis is on Mars. That goes for industry as well. Boeing Lockheed Aerojet Rocketdyne SpaceX and others put quite a bit of effort into designing a mission architecture. ? American moon partisans owe a debt to Europe which has tended the lunar flame during the ascent of Mars. Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner the director general of the European Space Agency. Since assuming the post he has argued persuasively that a ?lunar village? is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station. It would be in his view a celestial point of harmony for a terrestrial species in discord. There is a problem however: the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village and Russia ESA?s   partner in the venture has no money to commit. They have already been forced to downsize their presence on the ISS due to costs and have delayed plans for robotic exploration of the moon. (The head of the Russian space agency admits that Russia ?does not have financial capabilities for advanced space projects. ?) Lacking unity among member states to say nothing of technology development and financial resources what ESA really needs is for the United States to fund and spearhead such an effort. NASA?s sights however are firmly fixed on Mars. With the presidential transition however and a new NASA director still to be appointed lunar champions at home and abroad see an opportunity to abandon the Journey to Mars program and set sights a little closer to the Earth. To that end ESA is on a moon base   offensive from the light and easy (magazine spreads and aspirational illustrations) to   politics  (publicly pressing the NASA administrator on the issue.) The overt message from Paris where ESA is headquartered is: We?re doing this. The subtext is: While NASA plans a fantasy mission to Mars that will never happen the rest of the world will be driving moon buggies and mining  . But ESA?s campaign is powered by handwavium and for all the illustrations of lunar domes and our great big blue marble over the horizon progress on the moon base ends at Photoshop. If the U. S. doesn?t build the base it won?t get built. Casey Dreier the director of space policy for the Planetary Society a nonprofit space advocacy organization says that if any space agency really wants to land humans on the moon let alone build a colony there?s no getting around the commitment to a program on the order of Apollo ?  a colossal commitment that ESA has not addressed.   ?First you?d have to see a commitment to hardware that could get humans to the moon? Dreier says. ?Soyuz [the   spacecraft] doesn?t get to you there. ? Even if deep space hardware for   missions existed however there?s the more fundamental problem of actually getting it into space. ?You would need a new heavy launch rocket or plans that use existing rockets for   assembly of hardware and that?s just to get to the moon. ? (Only American rockets in development have the requisite lift.) There?s still the most challenging part of the mission: the lander. ?Even more basically? says Dreier ?ESA has to come together formally and commit votes. If there was a serious project member nations would commit funds and decide things like: What do you do there?? The moon has always been part of NASA?s Journey to Mars program. Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan cislunar space ?  the 250 000 miles between the Earth and the moon ?  is essential. NASA calls it the ?proving grounds? and intends to develop that part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition. Moreover the Space Launch System (the colossal ?Mars rocket? able to lift heavy payloads into space) and the Orion spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in 2009 by President Obama. The first stop on Constellation?s roadmap was the moon meaning SLS and Orion both soon to roll off the assembly line are  . Carberry says that if we change focus to the moon however   we should still do so in the context of going to Mars. He points to the Apollo program as a good example of how not to frame a space mission. The first time NASA went to the moon it did so based on single reason: to beat the Soviet Union. Once that singular reason was accomplished there will little will to maintain momentum. The   goal ?  Here is what this is all building toward ?  never entered the public policy discussion. ?If you always have something beyond your current goal it strengthens resolve to keep moving? he says. ?You strengthen your argument by making sure you have those   goals ?  that this doesn?t stop at moon. Hopefully it won?t come to that. If we can use the surface of moon within the framework of going to Mars and we can stimulate commercial activity there that?s great but if we put everything into the moon we?ll be stuck there for decades. .. Does US want to do a moon program forever? I don?t know. Our advantage is clearly on Mars exploration. ? That advantage goes beyond national pride. NASA has been successfully landing spacecraft on Mars for 40 years. No other nation has succeeded in doing this even once. Exploring Mars is difficult as the crashed   Schiaparelli EDM lander confirmed in October. NASA has established a cadence of Mars missions each more complicated than the last each developing Martian science and engineering with eventual human exploration in mind. As long as the Mars missions continue the agency can iterate on its carefully accumulated institutional knowledge. If that knowledge is wasted and manufacturing partners spin down the entire Mars apparatus will have to be regrown from zero. This is the same problem NASA now suffers even in its limited plan to send astronauts to cislunar space. Although SLS and Orion are very far along in development it will still be another five years at least before a crewed mission can be attempted to lunar orbit replicating what Apollo 8 did 50 years ago. Wherever NASA is directed to go by the new administration will likely require a commitment that pushes the alternative back by decades. There?s simply no money in the NASA budget for both the moon and Mars. As the ISS demonstrated building the thing ?  moon base or Mars colony ?  is the cheap part. It?s the operational costs that bog exploration down. Twenty percent of NASA?s budget goes to keeping the space station crewed and in orbit. A moon base will entail a similar such slice of the pie which covers things like maintenance ground support technicians engineers physicians launches hardware supplies and food. You don?t maintain a moon base and gear up for Mars. Just the opposite: Going to Mars would specifically entail closing the moon base which places Mars on the other side of lunar exploration base design base construction base operations base maintenance and base divestment. NASA and world partners began work on the International Space Station began during Ronald Reagan?s first term. If we build a moon village we?ll be there for a very long time.                                                                                                                          Casey Dreier maintains that there is no correct destination for human spaceflight. ?To me? he says ?the least interesting argument in space exploration is ?moon or Mars.? It?s an important decision but not an interesting argument. Mars is not objectively the only answer. The fundamental issue at play is what do we do that pays dividends as nation. ? What dividends should we look for? Elon Musk advocates Mars colonization by defining Mars as humanity?s failsafe ?  that once we settle and flourish on a second world no matter what catastrophe might befall Earth be it an asteroid or atomic devastation the human species can survive. NASA frames Mars exploration in more hopeful terms calling it a scientific endeavor through which we can learn about the evolution Earth and life. Either way those are enticing and worthy goals. Astronauts can press boot prints into Martian soil in less than 20 years but for that to happen NASA must stay the course.
465,73308,Opening Paragraphs Don?t Always Have to Be Exciting,Atlantic,Joe Fassler,1/4/2017,2017,1,,By Heart is a series in which authors share and discuss their   favorite passages in literature. See entries from Karl Ove Knausgaard Jonathan Franzen Amy Tan Michael Chabon and more. There?s a widely circulated truism that short stories should start with a   ?hook? a can?   first line that foregrounds conflict right away. (You know the kind of thing: ?On the morning of the day my brother killed my father I spent an hour unburying my truck from new snow. ?) But Emily Ruskovich the author of Idaho teaches her writing students not to grab at the reader so directly ?  the technique she says tends to result in desperate dishonest openings. In her conversation for this series Ruskovich discussed Alice Munro?s ?The Love of a Good Woman? a novella that begins in the least flashy way possible: on the musty shelves of a local museum with   descriptions of the objects displayed there. The dramatic plot includes a murder a   the discovery of a body a life destroyed by guilt ?  but the narrative proceeds with great discipline revealing its secrets carefully over time. Ruskovich explained how the story?s power horror and beauty derive from Munro?s restraint and how its central image ?  a red box full of optometrist?s tools ?  becomes a powerful reminder of what?s missed when we move too quickly to look closely.   Like ?The Love of a Good Woman? Idaho is a murder mystery ?  but the mystery is not who did it so much as so much as how why and with what consequence. The novel centers around Wade an Idaho man who has lost both his daughters when his   Jenny murdered one child the other fled into the woods and disappeared for good. As Wade slips into dementia ?  with catatonic episodes that can turn violent ?  we like his second wife Ann try to reconstruct understand and ultimately come to terms with the sorrowful events of the past. Emily Ruskovich is a graduate of the Iowa Writers? Workshop where she was my classmate and was a James C. McCreight Fiction Fellow at the University of  . Her fiction has appeared in Zoetrope One Story and the Virginia Quarterly Review in 2015 she won an O. Henry Award for her story ?Owl. ? She teaches writing at the University of   and spoke to me by phone. Emily Ruskovich: I first read Alice Munro when I was in college and I?d never heard of her before. My professor Deirdre McNamer gave me a copy of her story ?Runaway? ?  and when I read it I felt as if I?d been unlocked. It wasn?t that I had something in common with the character. It was that I had something in common with the story with its very structure. Munro completely captured the mysterious way my own memory works. I remember going up to my professor having no idea who Munro was having only read this one story in a bad photocopy. I was just kind of concerned. I said ?I don?t understand why this woman isn?t famous. Does she know how good she is?? My teacher laughed. ?She?s pretty famous? she said. ?I think she knows. ? I don?t actually recall the first time I read ?The Love of a Good Woman. ? I?ve read it so many times because I teach it in many of my classes. But every time I read the story I find something new ?  I become obsessed with some new discovery. The story is about a woman Enid who finds out that the husband of the sick dying lady she cares for has committed murder. That plot in the hands of a lesser writer would already be interesting. But even though the plot of this story is intense ?  there is murder there is lust there are secrets there are many vivid mysterious scenes ?  the whole story especially the beginning is so quiet. And the quietness is where the story?s intensity comes from. It begins like this: For the last couple of decades there has been a museum in Walley dedicated to preserving photos and butter churns and horse harnesses and an old dentist?s chair and a cumbersome apple peeler and such curiosities as the pretty little    insulators that were used on telegraph poles. Also there is a red box which has the letters D. M. WILLENS OPTOMETRIST printed on it and a note beside it saying ?This box of optometrist?s instruments though not very old has considerable local significance since it belonged to Mr. D. M. Willens who drowned in the Peregrine River 1951. It escaped the catastrophe and was found presumably by the anonymous donor who dispatched it to be a feature of our collection. ? This opening shows such amazing restraint. Munro is so confident in her writing that she never feels the need to ?grab? a reader right away which is something I think a lot of writing teachers try to get their students to do ?  advice that often results in dishonest beginnings. This idea that you?re going to lose your reader if your first paragraph doesn?t contain something really exciting ?  I just think that?s false. I don?t want to be hooked or grabbed. I don?t need to be tricked into reading a story. Of course a story does need to have some kind of tension from the first line. In this case it?s the confidence of this mysterious voice the assurance with which the narrator lays out these ordinary details. The mystery is: Why here? Why is this brilliant author starting the story in this seemingly straightforward way? I am grabbed by this beginning not because it is especially exciting but because I trust Munro?s voice. If she believes that she must begin with a   description of an item in a museum then I am fascinated by that item because she is fascinated by it and because I sense all that she is withholding in her attempt to be honest and straightforward. I trust her absolutely and I don?t think there is anything more important than that to a reader. Making Art at the Painful Margins But the subdued tone here is more than stylistic. We come to discover that it is intricately tied to character as everything in a Munro story is. If Munro feels that she wants to start a story in a very restrained way it?s because the character shows an immense amount of restraint. And though she is not introduced until many pages into the story restraint is the defining trait of Enid the protagonist. She?s a nurse which means she puts aside her needs to attend to the needs of others. Enid has this story she tells herself about who she is: She is the person who gives up what she loves because other people ask her to. It?s this romantic notion she has that seeps out of the cracks in her otherwise very restrained very orderly and medical outlook on her life. Restraint is central too to the murder at the heart of the story. Rupert the husband of the woman Enid cares for is an extremely restrained person ?  when Enid gives him a compliment about something his smart little girl said he can?t even acknowledge her compliment though she senses he?s pleased. He?s the kind of person who spends his life ignoring anything that is remotely emotional or uncomfortable deflecting those things with idle remarks about the weather or the cutting of the hay. But we find out that one day he came home and found the optometrist Mr. Willens examining his wife ?  he was kneeling on the floor with his hand on her leg and accidentally her skirt had been pulled up slightly above her knee. Somehow this enrages him. Emotion just overflows in him and he commits murder just like that. A lifetime of restraint builds up to the point that he has an absolute lapse of control. Munro describes the aftermath of the murder this way: ?Rupert jumped out of the chair so that it was still rocking and he started picking up all the things and putting each one back where it went in Mr. Willens? box. ? To me that?s such a human response. It?s what most characterizes Rupert this repression this obsession with order. Here he?s got Mr. Willens?s dead body in his room with   foam coming out of his mouth ?  and yet the first thing he does after that lapse of control is put all the   instruments back into this red box. Everything in him is entirely under the surface. And so later when Alice Munro puts a hatchet in that man?s hands and has another character tell him that she knows all his secrets the danger is so much greater. If you only read the story once it?s easy to miss that we?ve been introduced to this red box already. But it?s right there on the first page: ?Also there was a red box? with this casual little ?also? there as if it?s an afterthought. Of course it?s not at all an afterthought ?  it?s the key to an unsolved murder even though we could never know that at the beginning. We can only sense it the quiet intensity of Munro?s voice. The last thing we learn about this box is that Mrs. Quinn Rupert?s wife and Enid?s patient hid it somewhere ?  Mrs. Quinn will never tell where. Yet here at the beginning of this story we know exactly where it is. It?s in the museum but how did it get there? The museum offers its own explanation: ?It was found presumably by the anonymous donor. ? ?Presumably?: an   distant museum word. Yet it contains the whole aching mystery of these characters? lives a mystery that the story is too perfect to outright name. It?s so hard to exercise this level of restraint. In flashier stories I often encounter images that feel to me ultimately to be dishonest. I?m thinking of a story I read recently by a renowned author that begins with a   narrator describing the drowning of his daughter. She?s on a lake playing hockey and the ice breaks and she drowns ?  but the way that this narrator describes his daughter drowning is so beautiful. There?s something about her hair drifting upward as she goes under the hockey stick left spinning on the ice like a compass. These are amazing similes and descriptors. But I was kind of appalled because this is not how a father would remember the drowning of his daughter. He simply would not use language that way. There would be absolutely nothing beautiful about it. The story was   and it was published in a great magazine but something that Alice Munro never does is privilege language over character or anything over character. This is something I try to think about when I?m writing ?  there are times definitely when I feel like I have to cut back on what I?ve just written because it?s not quite honest yet. In my novel I wrote about an event that?s so shocking and ugly ?  the murder of a little girl. I struggled the whole book with how to make clear what happened the actual events of what took place without the language being too direct as to be vulgar or too vague as to be beautiful. It was a challenge to describe something so ugly and unfathomable in language that was both plainspoken and mysterious while also remaining true to the voice of the novel which is a poetic voice. I had to go back and exercise restraint sometimes really struggle over certain paragraphs for a long time. The challenge is to word something clearly while also leaving enough room for mystery to let things remain open and complex for the reader even if I?ve made up my mind. That?s always very hard. At the end of ?The Love of a Good Woman? Enid imagines that she?s going to tell Rupert that she knows he committed murder. In her vision of things she?s going to lead him back to the police station and he?s going to confess and they?re going to kind of have this weird romance while he?s in prison. I remember teaching this story once and trying to explain about open endings: Even though we don?t get to see Enid follow through the fact that she has made the decision to do what she?s going to do is an ending in its own. But then one of my students raised her hand. ?But Ms. Ruskovich? she said. ?We do know what happens. Or at least we know what doesn?t happen. ? And she read out loud the passage from the very beginning about the red box: ?This box of optometrist?s instruments though not very old has considerable local significance since it belonged to Mr. D. M. Willens who drowned in the Peregrine River in 1951. ? And she was right ?  though in all the times that I had read this story I never saw it. I never saw that the answer to the ending was in this little aside right here in the second paragraph. Because if Enid had turned Rupert in the local museum certainly wouldn?t have had a sign saying that Mr. Willens drowned in the Peregrine River. We know then she did not do what she?d resolved to do. So how did the box get there? The only conceivable answer is that Enid  ?     well I don?t know actually. I guess that?s why I love this. The closer you get to a character the more mysterious he or she becomes. The closer you get to that red box the more mysterious it becomes. When you start the story the box is just an object sitting among other objects covered in dust ?  next to a horse harness and an old dentist?s chair and an apple peeler. But as you read and   you start to sense the human history that can be told through these objects. Each one is suffused with a whole lifetime of compassion and secrets and suffering. And though Munro gives us the privilege of looking at one of them the red box the other objects are left unspoken for. That?s very moving: you get the sense that you could write an entire novel about the horse harness too or the dentist?s chair or the apple peeler. The story itself is as   as its characters in the way that it?s told the way scenes are arranged with no great attention at all paid to the most crucial of details ?  even though those details are there plainly for everyone to see infused with a mystery so profound that they can only be articulated plainly. Some of my students have even remarked that these opening passages are ?boring. ? And yet this beginning ?  this distant restrained   beginning ?  is the key to everything. It?s so honest. So real. The greatest mysteries of humanity are hidden in plain sight here hidden inside of such   language.
466,73309,TV Shows to Look Forward to in 2017 (So Far),Atlantic,David Sims,1/4/2017,2017,1,,More and more superheroes are encroaching on the world of TV (though not as much as film). But there?s plenty else to look forward to on the small screen in 2017: debuts of promising original shows new seasons of critical favorites like The Leftovers and Fargo and the   return of Star Trek one of television?s most famous franchises to its original medium. Below a list of the 20 most exciting shows in the coming year. Emerald City Friday on NBCPremieres January 6 In the last 10 years audiences have gotten Wicked Oz the Great and Powerful and a revamped The Wiz but NBC in its infinite wisdom thinks the world needs a fresh take on The Wizard of Oz so here?s a ?dark and edgy? reboot. Directed by the visually adventurous Tarsem Singh (who made The Fall and the Snow White update Mirror Mirror) Emerald City features Vincent D?Onofrio as the Wizard steampunk helicopters and a German Shepherd Toto. Your best guess as to the point of all this is as good as mine. One Day at a Time Friday on NetflixPremieres January 6 Though Netflix has experimented with the TV format over the years it?s beginning to embrace the     comedy as well here revamping Norman Lear?s classic family sitcom for 2017 audiences. One Day at a Time is still a   sitcom about a single mother ?  Penelope (Justina Machado) a   military veteran with a teenage daughter and ?socially adept tween? son. Rita Moreno   as Penelope?s grandmother and early reviews are strong. Taboo Tuesday on FXPremieres January 10 This miniseries comes from   Steven Knight (who wrote Dirty Pretty Things Locke and Allied among others) Tom Hardy and his father credited as ?Chips? Hardy. Unfortunately Taboo is not about how Chips got his nickname ?  it?s an   story about a mysterious man (played by Tom Hardy) who returns to London in 1814 after years in Africa seeking revenge on the East India Company for his father?s death. A Series of Unfortunate Events Friday on NetflixPremieres January 13 Fans largely derided the 2004 film adaptation of Lemony Snicket?s series of dark children?s novels. But an   Netflix series might prove a better medium for translating the   series with author Daniel Handler (who penned the books under the Snicket pseudonym) scripting. Neil Patrick Harris stars as the villainous Count Olaf with Joan Cusack Patrick Warburton and Alfre Woodard among the supporting cast. The Young Pope Sunday on HBOPremieres January 15 Here?s the pitch: Lenny Belardo (Jude Law) is the new pope (the first American in history to hold the position) and boy is he young. Created by the operatic Italian director Paolo Sorrentino (behind such films as The Great Beauty and Youth) The Young Pope isn?t going for subtlety but it has already aired in Italy and the UK to critical acclaim. HBO is positioning the show as its big winter prestige drama and if nothing else it looks like opulent fun. Diane Keaton   as Lenny?s mentor and personal secretary. Riverdale Thursday on The CWPremieres January 26 A millennial revamping of the Archie Comics universe which features a surprisingly buff Archie Andrews (K. J. Apa) a ?philosophically bent? Jughead (whatever that may mean) a mysterious past for Cheryl Blossom and Luke Perry as Archie?s grizzled dad. Betty and Veronica are on board too of course.  As silly as some of the details might sound early word on the show is strong perhaps because it was developed by the veteran   and TV writer Roberto  . Powerless Thursday on NBCPremieres February 2 Unlike Marvel?s attempts at television   to its superhero movies Powerless (which is connected to the DC comics universe) is a show about ordinary folks trying to live their lives around the chaos of Superman Batman and their ilk saving lives. Vanessa Hudgens and Danny Pudi star as office drones working in the bowels of Bruce Wayne?s company with Alan Tudyk as their tyrannical boss. Essentially it?s a workplace sitcom just with superheroes whizzing around in the background. Santa Clarita Diet Friday on NetflixPremieres February 3 Sprung from the truly underrated comic mind of Victor Fresco (Andy Richter Controls the Universe Better Off Ted) Santa Clarita Diet might be his first series to not suffer an untimely cancellation despite critical acclaim thanks to the less   honchos at Netflix. Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant star as   agents getting divorced whose lives then take an unspecified ?dark turn. ? 24: Legacy Sunday on FoxPremieres February 5 After eight seasons a revival and a TV movie Kiefer Sutherland?s Jack Bauer is officially retired but Fox is reviving the   action of 24 yet again focusing on a new agent at the fictional   Unit. Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins) an   Ranger is sure to get sucked into many a deadly conspiracy with Miranda Otto and Jimmy Smits among the ensemble he has to protect. Will the show work without Kiefer screaming into his cellphone? Legion Wednesday on FXPremieres February 8 Viewers are getting another superhero   show but this one?s adjacent to the   universe and based on the character Legion a schizophrenic who realizes there may be more to his diagnosis. Legion is a tricky character to get right but the show is from the talented Noah Hawley (Fargo) and has a terrific cast including Dan Stevens (Downton Abbey) Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) and Fargo alumnus Jean Smart. Girls Sunday on HBOReturns February 12 Much ink has been spilled about Girls since its debut in 2012 but this is everyone?s last shot to weigh in on Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham) and company?s antics ?  season six will be the last. These final 10 episodes will surely air free of controversy and nary a hot take will be written about them especially ones about what the show has meant for millennial culture. Crashing Sunday on HBOPremieres February 19 One potential successor for Girls is another HBO   shepherded to screen by comedy vet Judd Apatow. Pete Holmes a brilliant   who has long been in search of the right TV project (his TBS   talk show was canceled too soon) created Crashing and based it on his own life in the   world. It follows Pete (Holmes playing himself) who?s trying to cobble together a living as a comedian while dealing with the collapse of his marriage. The Good Fight Sunday on CBS All AccessPremieres February 19 A spinoff of   legal drama The Good Wife this show is being used to launch CBS?s new streaming service CBS All Access premiering on the TV network before bouncing over to the online   network. Set a year after The Good Wife?s finale The Good Fight follows Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) as she moves to a new Chicago law firm with her former colleague Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) and her goddaughter Maia (Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones). Delroy Lindo   as a rival attorney. Iron Fist Friday on NetflixPremieres March 17 The Netflix Marvel universe continues to build out with its most problematic superhero ?  Danny Rand (played by Finn Jones of Game of Thrones) a billionaire industrialist who has been missing for 15 years and returns to New York proficient in kung fu. Though Rand (created in the ?70s during the first   boom for   movies in the U. S.) has always been written as white he may be an uncomfortable sight for Marvel in 2017 especially after the whitewashing controversy over its film Doctor Strange. The Handmaid?s Tale Wednesday on HuluPremieres April 26 Margaret Atwood?s 1985 masterpiece of speculative fiction set in a totalitarian theocracy where women?s rights have been erased by a religious movement that seized power in the United States seems quite relevant to the contemporary political mood and has never gotten a proper adaptation. Hulu is positioning this   series as its prestige drama of the spring with Elisabeth Moss starring as Offred Joseph Fiennes Samira Wiley and Yvonne Strahovski  . FargoReturns this spring on FX No official premiere date has been set for the third season of Fargo but the cast is as stacked as ever with Ewan McGregor playing dual lead roles and Carrie Coon (The Leftovers) David Thewlis Michael Stuhlbarg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead all involved. Unlike the last season the show will be set in the   day (2010 according to reports) opening up the possibility that characters from its first season could return (though the creator Noah Hawley is keeping quiet about any plot details). The Leftovers Returns this April on HBO In its second season this TV adaptation of Tom Perrotta?s novel The Leftovers built on its promise to become one of the best most fascinating confounding shows on television. Perhaps cognizant that his last great show (Lost) lasted a little too long   Damon Lindelof is ending the show this year shifting the action to Australia but keeping the entire main cast (minus Ann Dowd?s dearly departed Patti Levin). The show will struggle to top season 2?s episode ?International Assassin? but whatever Lindelof and Perrotta do come up with is sure to be fascinating. American Gods Premieres this April on Starz A   adaptation of Neil Gaiman?s 2001 novel focusing on Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) an   recruited by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane) who is recruiting the world?s forgotten gods (to say more would be spoiling). Adapted by Bryan Fuller (Hannibal) and Michael Green (Kings) the series which was initially in production at HBO promises to be a suitably epic take on Gaiman?s writing. (The first season will cover only the first third of his novel). Star Trek: Discovery Premieres this May on CBS All Access The first Star Trek show since Enterprise concluded in 2005 Discovery has a heavy fan burden to shoulder but an exciting cast and crew aboard. Set 10 years before the original Star Trek series Discovery will not take place in the world of the recent rebooted film series instead charting the journey of the USS Discovery after weathering a much discussed but secret ?incident? in Trek lore. Sonequa   (The Walking Dead) stars as Rainsford the ship?s second officer (the first   officer to headline a Trek series). Like The Good Fight this show will premiere on CBS then move to its All Access streaming network. Game of Thrones Returns this summer on HBO Knocked from its usual April perch by a filming schedule that demanded more time in snowier climes (winter has after all come to Westeros) the seventh and penultimate season of Game of Thrones will arrive at some point this summer on HBO for an abridged seven episodes. Will George R. R. Martin finish his next book before then? Will Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen become the best of friends? Will Cersei Lannister?s quest for power finally end in glory? All that and much more as HBO tries to squeeze as much life out of its big ticket as possible before the whole shebang wraps in 2018.
467,73310,The Ideological Reasons Why Democrats Have Neglected Local Politics,Atlantic,Emma Green,1/4/2017,2017,1,,After making it to the top Barack Obama is looking down. In October the outgoing president signaled that he will focus on   politics when he leaves office. This promise took on new urgency after the election which left Republicans in control of 32 statehouses and 33 governor?s mansions not to mention both chambers of Congress and the White House. ?One of the big suggestions that I have for Democrats as I leave   ?     is how do we do more of that   building?? the president told NPR in December. ?What I?m interested in is just developing a whole new generation of talent. ? Obama seems to be taking part in the larger process of soul searching among Democrats. ?I wonder sometimes whether the Democratic Party has contributed to [a decline in local politics] by making the president and the federal government the fulcrum of so much and suggesting that we can solve these problems from the top down? said David Axelrod the former senior Obama administration advisor during a recent panel discussion at the University of Chicago. ?Democrats have ceded a lot of statehouses and legislatures. Congress has been gridlocked. And the notion has been: What can the president do with the power that he has to try and create some progressive action? It just puts a lot of weight on the presidency when maybe we have to be a bit more innovative. ? The Atlantic  Politics  Policy Daily: Congress Clocks In These explanations are not primarily philosophical. They?re about winning. In the face of painful electoral losses Democrats are rediscovering the strategic case for activism at the state and local level. Yet there are deep historical and ideological reasons why the party has tended to focus on the federal government as a means of making policy. An ideological shift would be much more important and is more unlikely than a strategic one. As Democrats move to focus on state and local politics in 2017 this distinction between ideology and strategy will be important to watch. The party and progressives more broadly could take up a friendly posture toward state and local governance on the grounds that Americans should directly influence the laws that constrain them and the policies that supposedly benefit them. Alternatively this sudden impulse toward state and local organizing could prove instrumental and temporary doomed to reversal whenever the party wins back the U. S. Senate or the White House. Democrats? approach to federalism will matter for the future of the party and the permanence of its policies. But ultimately it will show what Democratic leaders really believe about people?s proper role in their government. For some progressives a renewed focus on state and local politics is primarily about obstructing Washington Republicans. Heather Gerken a Yale law professor wrote a piece for Vox about why the left should embrace federalism in the coming years ?  essentially she argued it offers ways to counteract federal policies. ?Progressives at the state and local level can influence policy simply by refusing to partner with the federal government? she wrote. ?If blue states and cities refuse to implement Trump?s agenda Republicans will sometimes be forced to compromise rather than pay a political and fiscal price. ? For others local politics are more important in their own right. ?We think there?s a lot of importance in protecting local democracy? said Nikki Fortunato Bas the executive director of the Partnership for Working Families a network of regional advocacy organizations that work on economic and environmental issues. ?It?s in the communities [where] we live [that] we?re most connected to the need of our neighbors and lawmakers are most connected to the needs of their constituents. ? Regardless of their reasons for wanting to focus on state and local politics Democrats will be limited by the enormous imbalances of party power in governors? mansions state legislatures and city halls. Especially during Obama?s second term in office the party lost control and influence in a number of statehouses. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures the party controls roughly half as many state legislatures as it did in 2010 and roughly half as many states will enter 2017 with a partisan split compared to the same year. Similarly Democrats have been losing governships steadily since Obama took office in 2008: Compared to the 29 states held by Democrats that year the party now holds 16. The only place where Democrats still dominate across the country is in large cities where they control many city halls. The unevenness is partly a reflection of progressives? reluctance to push their policy agendas through states. Historically arguments against federalism ?  or the principle that power should be robustly shared between state and national governments ?  have centered on race. ?Progressives are deeply skeptical of federalism and with good reason? Gerken wrote in a 2012 essay in Democracy. ?States? rights have been invoked to defend some of the most despicable institutions in American history most notably slavery and Jim Crow. ? Others see the decentralization of governing power as a way of stifling dissent she argued. This is one reason why the national Democratic Party has often looked to Washington to make and enforce policy. But there?s another ideological explanation argued Ernest Young a professor of law at Duke University in an interview: The progressive project is ultimately about working toward a society built on one unified vision of policy and culture rather than a diverse array of policies and cultures. ?If you?re confident that you can get the right answer to something like   policy or welfare or any number of very difficult social problems it?s hard not to say that right answer should be equally available to everyone? Young said meaning that progressives believe their ?right answers? should be legislated through federal policy. ?If you?re a more Burkean type of conservative and you?re skeptical that we?re ever going to find out right answers to these questions you might favor different solutions in different jurisdictions and see from experience what works out. That tends to lend itself to a commitment to federalism and local governments too? he said. Not all progressives believe that most policymaking should happen at the federal level. Especially in recent years some policymakers have looked to cities and municipalities to lead reform efforts. ?Cities were the original sites of disruption: They disrupt class orders they disrupt social practices they disrupt businesses? said Jennifer Bradley the director of the Center for Urban Innovation at the Aspen Institute. No matter what Obama and other national Democrats may say this work has already been in progress she added. ?This notion that Democrats were relying too heavily on the federal government is belied by eight years of what actually happened? she said. In part because Washington is so dysfunctional ?cities and states have learned to rely less and less on the federal government and I think that trend will sharply accelerate. ? Practically speaking the narrative that progressives favor federal policymaking while conservatives favor state and local action is far too simplistic. Both parties tend to use federal power when they have it. ?George W. Bush as a matter of ideology cared a lot about states? Young pointed out. ?But the first thing he did as president was to shift power to the federal government in the area of education which had been a terribly important area of state predominance. ? Conversely both parties have used   litigation to intervene in federal policymaking when they?ve been out of power. Take Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency the   Supreme Court case in which 12 states several cities and advocacy groups sued to force the EPA to begin regulating greenhouse gases. During the Obama years other states pulled a similar move ?  Texas sued the administration over deferred immigration enforcement for people in the country illegally for example. ?Broadly I think federalism is not a conservative or liberal thing or a Republican or Democrat thing? Young said. ?It offers a way of not having all your eggs in one basket when changes in who controls various institutions occur. ? It?s also a way of making sure one party doesn?t force the other permanently out of power at the national level: As Democrats are now discovering it?s hard to get elected in districts that   state legislatures have gerrymandered to favor their own party. But there?s a reason why the United States is not a constellation of    . Federalism is a political orientation not a body of   policy prescriptions. The negotiation of power between national and state governments ?  and relatedly between state and local governments ?  is complicated and partisan. Larger bodies of government led by Democrats and Republicans alike often threaten smaller bodies with litigation or funding cuts if they don?t follow certain policies. During the Reagan years the federal government famously used this method to get states to comply with its policy on the legal drinking age. And in 2016 the Obama administration used a similar method when it sent a letter to school districts instructing them to comply with federal guidance on accommodations for transgender students. States often write laws limiting cities from legislating certain issues as well. North Carolina?s H. B. 2 may have been the most notorious of these kinds of prohibitions in 2016: Among other things the statute prohibited cities from passing   ordinances to protect LGBT residents. Preemption on LGBT issues is fairly new according to the Partnership for Working Families. States preempt cities and municipalities most frequently on issues like transportation regulations   standards labor agreements and policies on earned sick days the organization reports. If national Democrats are truly interested in revitalizing state and local governance perhaps they?ll push to repeal these kinds of preemption laws which force policy decisions into the realm of larger and larger legislative bodies. Or maybe they?ll swear off executive orders on which the Obama administration heavily relied whenever they eventually regain federal power. It?s not like voters are big fans of the federal government anyways: According to Pew Research Center Americans? trust in bodies like Congress has been declining for at least the last decade while their belief in state and local bodies is much higher and has remained relatively constant over the years. This might be the most compelling of all arguments for a new era of federalism: Voters simply don?t like or trust the federal government. As a new administration prepares to take office ?The one thing I really hope states and locals can do is model a different kind of political behavior? Bradley said. ?What I would hope is that the actions of state and local lawmakers can restore people?s faith and trust honestly in democracy. ?
468,73313,Republicans Grapple With the Risk of Overreach,Atlantic,Russell Berman,1/3/2017,2017,1,,?Let us not be timid? Paul Ryan exhorted members of the House on Tuesday moments after 239 Republicans had in   fashion   him as speaker. He was girding his party for what he called ?the opportunity of a lifetime? ?  the chance to remake Washington under   Donald Trump and unified Republican control of government. Ryan needn?t have worried about his members? gumption: They had committed their first act of political overreach before the 115th Congress was even sworn in. The night before a majority of House Republicans had voted behind closed doors to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics a   independent body that had arisen out of the last era of GOP scandal. They had acted against the better judgment of their leaders including Ryan who had accurately warned them that such a move would undermine the party?s effort to open the new Congress in a mood of unity and optimism. A predictable uproar ensued and with a modest push from Trump Republican lawmakers hastily reconvened to rescind their amendment barely five minutes before the 115th Congress gaveled into session. The GOP?s Ethics Disaster The episode was in a sense a test of political boundaries for a party that sees itself as having won a broad mandate from the voters. If Trump could get away with all manner of offensive comments damaging revelations ethical malfeasance and still get elected president what would stop lawmakers from neutering a pesky ethics office that had ensnared many of them (and Democrats too!) in investigations? As it turned out Trump?s victory did not mean the end of public scrutiny it did not immunize politicians from nasty headlines or angry phone calls emails and tweets. Republicans backed away from their ethics gambit but as Ryan made clear they are intent on acting swiftly on an ambitious policy agenda to dismantle key parts of the Obama presidency and replace them with   conservative reforms. ?We have a lot to do ?  and a lot to undo? House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote in a message to lawmakers over the weekend. GOP leaders plan to devote the next two weeks to teeing up legislation that Trump can sign in his  first weeks in office. The House will vote this week on bills to prevent Obama from issuing a slew of new regulations on his way out of office and to ensure Congress has a say in major new regulations going forward. The first day in the Senate brought the introduction of a budget resolution that will lay the groundwork for repealing core pieces of the Affordable Care Act. The two chambers hope to send the actual repeal bill ?  sans an Obamacare replacement ?  to Trump?s desk in the next month or so. ?The people have given us unified government? Ryan said in his    opening address. ?And it wasn?t because they were feeling generous. It?s because they wanted results. How could we live with ourselves if we let them down? How could we let ourselves down?? If Republicans are feeling pressure to deliver results for their voters so too are Democrats under pressure to deliver a fight for theirs. The beginning of a new Congress usually brings a brief respite from the usual partisanship. Young children clog the Capitol halls as lawmakers bring their families to their   the two chambers gavel in with rituals of pomp and circumstance and   members learn the way to their offices (and to the bathrooms). But on this opening day Democrats in both the House and the Senate were digging in for battle. In a   of Republican rules designed to punish actual member protests Democratic House members embellished their speaker votes for Nancy Pelosi by adding the preamble ?Because the people?s House should be ethical accountable and open to free debate. .. ? During her ceremonial introduction of Ryan upon his election as speaker Pelosi digressed to warn Republicans that if they tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act cut Medicare or otherwise roll back Obama?s legacy ?Democrats will stand our ground. ? And in the Senate the new Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York used his own opening remarks to warn both Trump and the Republican majorities that Democrats would hold them accountable across the full range of promises that they made during the campaign. ?We will hold Trump accountable to the values that truly make America great? Schumer said. ?But we?ll fight him tooth and nail when he appeals to the baser instincts that diminish America and its greatness ?  instincts that have too often plagued this country and his campaign. ? Democrats are banking on Republicans falling short ?  that the party unity on display in Ryan?s election on Tuesday will quickly fade that the slim GOP majority in the Senate will stumble and bicker that an inexperienced and impatient president will grow frustrated with his party?s struggle in Congress. And most of all Democrats are waiting for Republicans to overreach to interpret a narrow presidential victory as an endorsement of conservative dogma and push forward with   changes to entitlements the tax code and consumer protections. That they believe would invite a public backlash ?  much like the one that greeted Republicans on Tuesday after their   ethics maneuver. Republicans may have learned that the law of political gravity still applies to them. But their chastening on ethics isn?t likely to humble them on policy. GOP leaders have been waiting for this moment for a decade and don?t expect them to be timid. 
469,73314,Why Christians Are Disproportionately Powerful in Congress,Atlantic,Emma Green,1/3/2017,2017,1,,The 115th Congress is back in session and at least one thing looks the same as usual: 91 percent of its members identify as Christians. This proportion has basically remained constant for more than five decades as long as this kind of data has been available according to a new study from Pew Research Center. What has changed is the U. S. population: Only 71 percent of American adults identify as Christians. Some religious minorities including Muslims Hindus and Buddhists are slightly underrepresented in Congress relative to their population sizes in the United States while others including Jews and Mormons are slightly overrepresented. But these groups aren?t the source of the demographic mismatch between Congress and the rest of the country. The Americans who are vastly underrepresented in Congress are those who don?t identify with any religion at all: Only one member of Congress Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona says she is religiously unaffiliated while 10 others declined to state their affiliation in surveys and interviews with CQ Roll Call. The Futility of Representing Religion With a Bar Chart There are at least two good explanations for this phenomenon. The first is that religiously unaffiliated Americans don?t vote. Another way of putting that is that young people don?t vote: According to the Public Religion Research Institute      are three times as likely to be religiously unaffiliated compared to people over 65. Even though the religiously unaffiliated share of the American population has significantly increased from 14 to 22 percent between 2004 and 2014 the share of religiously unaffiliated voters only increased from 9 to 12 percent. This chart offers a stark illustration of how politically disengaged these voters really are: Religiously Unaffiliated Americans Don?t Vote  Scholars and journalists have long decried the civic apathy of the young. But at least in terms of religious demographics it makes sense that there has not been a political revolution under the banner of irreligion: ?Religiously unaffiliated? is a category popularized by pollsters. It is a useful demographic tool but not a very useful way of understanding how these Americans think about politics. ?Religiously unaffiliated? means these Americans don?t feel like they?re part of any particular religious tradition or denomination. But that includes a huge and diverse group of people. Those who formally identify as atheists and agnostics are actually a minority representing roughly 3 and 4 percent of the American population respectively. Others in this group which includes roughly 23 percent of Americans might be in the process of changing religions or feel like they have no spiritual home in a formal house of worship. They include people who believe in God and people who might be married to a spouse with a different faith background. And they include lots of people who don?t find religion particularly important or relevant in their lives. This above all is why it?s suspect to suggest that religiously unaffiliated people are underrepresented in Congress: They are not actually a coherent demographic group. It makes some sense that people who have mixed feelings or don?t care about religion wouldn?t bother organizing to get more of their kind in Congress. It?s also possible that at least some of the members who claimed a specific faith on their CQ Roll Call survey are only nominally religious anyways. After all any pollster worth his galleons knows it?s tough to elect atheists to political office.   If this is truly a crisis of representation there?s good news. Religiously unaffiliated Americans who are bothered by their lack of a voice in Congress can use one simple trick to start making change: They can vote.

471,73318,Can Trump Enforce His Red Line on North Korea?,Atlantic,James Acton,1/6/2017,2017,1,,It was only eight years ago that the United States had just one president at a time. Yet those days have felt much more distant over the past two months as the   Donald Trump has set about merrily reshaping U. S. policy 140 characters at a time. Tuesday evening saw what might turn out to be one of his more consequential Twitter proclamations. In a New Year?s address North Korea?s supreme leader Kim Jong Un had stated that his country had ?entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile. ? In response Trump tweeted that ?North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U. S. It won?t happen!? How to Stop a Nuclear Missile If Trump?s tweet is to be taken literally ?  and perhaps as the saying goes it should be taken seriously but not literally ?  he appears to have committed to preventing Kim from acquiring the capability to threaten the United States with a   missile as opposed to necessarily stopping the test that Kim says he is planning. Yet regardless of Trump?s actual intentions the tweet could come to be seen as a ?red line? and hence set up a potential test of his credibility. Much will depend of course on whether Trump subsequently doubles down on his pledge but now that the tweet is out there he has only limited influence on how it is viewed by North Korea U. S. allies and the American people. Past U. S. presidents have discovered that red lines against North Korea are easy to set but difficult to enforce. On June 29 2006 when North Korea was preparing to test another   missile President George W. Bush declared that launching it would be ?unacceptable. ? Not only did Pyongyang go ahead with the launch anyway but it did so on July 4. North Korea crossed other U. S. red lines too that year. In October Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test in spite of a warning by Bush a year earlier that ?a   North Korea will not be tolerated. ? The United States has been putting up with the Kim dynasty?s possession of nuclear weapons ever since. Over the last year North Korea?s   efforts have made significant progress due to an unprecedented level of testing. Unless those efforts are somehow checked there can be little doubt that even without foreign assistance they will result in a   intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ?  though there is some uncertainty about timing. It is difficult to conceive how Trump could enforce his red line ?  if that is what he decides to do ?  without ultimately reaching a negotiated settlement or authorizing   military action. The other policy tools he might try to wield ?  economic sanctions pressure from China military threats and even limited strikes (such as blowing up a missile on the launch pad) ?  are not ends in themselves. They might be able to provide the United States with leverage at the negotiating table. If they don?t they could provide justification for a major attack. By themselves however they cannot deny North Korea a   ICBM indefinitely.   military action would be fraught with risks of which two stand out. First strikes against North Korean   missiles and their production infrastructure ?  the absolute minimum target set required to enforce Trump?s red line ?  would risk terrible retaliation. Seoul for example is within reach of a prodigious quantity of North Korean artillery. U. S. bases in Japan could be hit by   North Korean missiles some of which may already be  . Broadening the target set to include more North Korean military assets would merely increase Pyongyang?s incentives to employ whatever survived in even less discriminate ways. Second after a strike North Korea could ?  and almost certainly would ?  attempt to rebuild its missile force. As a result the United States would either need to occupy the country or else launch periodic strikes to ?mow the grass. ? Diplomacy then is the better option though ?better? is a relative term. In theory Trump?s goal could be met if North Korea agreed to suspend nuclear and   missile tests in return for some    concessions from the United States. This approach would stop North Korea from developing a   ICBM through trial and error. And while it would not stop theoretical and   research it would severely curtail the reliability of any resulting weapon. In practice the challenges to even reaching ?  let alone enforcing ?  a deal are manifold. For starters it is far from clear that North Korea actually wants a deal at least at any price that the United States and its allies might be willing to pay. Diplomacy would probably be more difficult if North Korea asked ?  as it might well do ?  for an end to joint U. S.  Korean military exercises or a peace treaty to replace the armistice that stopped the Korean War but didn?t formally end it as opposed to economic aid. In return for such   concessions South Korea might want much more on disarmament from North Korea than just a testing moratorium ?  though how much Trump would take Seoul?s concern into account is an open question. Moreover even if a reasonable quid pro quo can be reached there is the surprisingly thorny question of how to define a   missile. On February 29 2012 Pyongyang agreed to a moratorium on nuclear and   missile tests (among various other measures) in return for food aid from the United States. Only 16 days later North Korea announced plans for a satellite launch which the United States argued was an ICBM test in disguise. The deal fell apart shortly thereafter. Then there is the challenge of negotiating the timetable for the deal?s implementation. To maintain as much leverage over North Korea as possible the United States is likely to want to provide whatever concessions it agrees to make only after a prolonged period of compliance by Pyongyang. North Korea is likely to argue that it can?t trust Washington to cough up later and that it should be rewarded early. Yet in spite of these and other challenges there is really very little reason for the great dealmaker not to try his hand at diplomacy with Pyongyang. In the very best case he could prevent the emergence of a grave new threat to the United States indefinitely. More plausibly he could delay it by a few potentially valuable years. Even in the    worst case ?  that no deal is reach or it falls apart almost immediately ?  it is hard to see what the United States would lose from trying. Besides if it all goes wrong and North Korea successfully demonstrates a   ICBM Trump could always just deny he said it wouldn?t happen.
472,73319,Bright Lights Captures the Magic of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,Atlantic,Sophie Gilbert,1/6/2017,2017,1,,   Toward the end of Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher Reynolds rests on a couch frail but sparkling after receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild. ?There?s no business like show business? she says. Fisher resting her head on her mother?s shoulder senses an opportunity. ?You know what I have to say something? she says perfectly deadpan. ?Everything about it is appealing. ? Reynolds frowns intently and joins in. ?Nowhere can you get that special feeling. ? The pair work through the impromptu skit perfectly serious and perfectly in sync. There are moments like this peppered throughout Bright Lights a documentary by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens airing Saturday on HBO that captures the forceful personalities and extraordinary charisma of both women and their fierce but complex love for one another. The film debuted at the Cannes Film Festival last year and was originally scheduled to air in March but was moved up after Fisher and Reynolds died at the end of 2016 just a day apart. Given the context it functions as an adoring tribute to the two performers but it?s also a snapshot of the kind of relationship documentarians dream about: two eccentric outgoing personalities living in almost   proximity recalling their glory days.   Grey Gardens   Jane without the malice Bright Lights is endlessly charming and sometimes deeply moving. Considering Creativity and Addiction in The Life and Times of DJ AM  It helps that Reynolds and Fisher are such perfect representatives of their respective Hollywood generations the first a disciplined controlled product of the studio system and the second a messier unfiltered unflinchingly honest star whose candor about her   and addiction issues made her achievements more tangible. Bright Lights gets most of its scenes from Fisher following her to London to a Star Wars convention and around her house with its quirky decor and errant artifacts (a Princess Leia sex doll a suitcase named Robert). Reynold?s moments are more discreet more choreographed. But her wit is   and her harmony with Fisher completely in tune. ?I share everything with my daughter especially the check? she remarks in one scene. The film?s structure is loose almost nonexistent and its main arc seems to be Fisher?s concern for her mother?s health which comes across now as sharply poignant. Reynolds continues to book performances which wear her out so Fisher accompanies her to a cavernous hall in Connecticut and to a shopworn casino in Vegas where Reynolds zips across the floor on a motor scooter almost unrecognizable. ?You?ve heard of a tsunami see she?s ? Fisher quips early in the movie. The pair live in separate houses within the same Beverly Hills estate but they?re a constant presence in each other?s lives. ?I usually come to her? Fisher explains walking across the lawn clutching a cheese souffl she?s baked for her mother. ?I always come to her. ? (?That is a beautiful puff? Reynolds exclaims when she tastes the wares.) Bloom and Stevens feature a treasure trove of snapshots   footage film scenes and previously documented family moments thanks largely to Reynold?s passion for amassing Hollywood memorabilia. (One of the documentary?s subplots features her longtime attempts to found a museum along with her son Todd a supporting player in Bright Lights who tends to shrink next to the wattage of his mother and sister.) There are scenes of baby Carrie perfectly groomed for stardom even as an infant and even    Carrie compelled by her mother to guest in her cabaret act singing ?Bridge Over Troubled Water? with the power and sass of a teenage Janis Joplin. ?My mother wanted to be able to groom me for show business? Fisher says. ?The biggest thing I did that broke [her] heart was not do a nightclub act. ? Fisher allows the filmmakers virtually everywhere. In one scene she works out with a trainer sent over by Lucasfilm who tries to throw out her   cans and cigarettes to no avail. In another she chats with her friend Griffin Dunne while the pair sits on her bed recalling how he generously helped her out with the loss of her virginity. The cameras are rolling too when she has a manic episode sparked by her distress at Debbie?s frailty in the   to the SAG Awards. She huddles on the floor in tears then later launches into impassioned Hamlet quotes and songs while she?s having her nails done. Her concern for her mother is matched by Reynolds who frequently tears up when talking to the camera about Fisher?s many battles. But the overarching sense of the film is that the pair have found an easy peace together and that Reynolds is battling through each day mostly to be able to spend this time with her daughter. While Fisher insists Reynolds continues to perform because it ?feeds her in a way that family cannot? the impression in watching the pair interact is that their closeness means something more. In some moments the two almost morph into each other by way of shared duets and  . If Bright Lights is at times a sharp reminder of what?s been lost it?s also convincing evidence that wherever Fisher and Reynolds are now they?re almost certainly together.
473,73320,The Hacking Investigation Trump Wants Instead,Atlantic,Kaveh Waddell,1/6/2017,2017,1,,  Donald Trump wants to get to the bottom of news reports that revealed that intelligence agencies had intercepted chatter among Russian government officials celebrating Trump?s election. But although he was scheduled to get briefed on the matter on Friday he doesn?t seem very interested in the intelligence itself. Instead he wants to find out how details from an unreleased intelligence report  ?  the results of an investigation President Obama ordered last month ?   made their way to the press. He tweeted Friday: I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. The   wasn?t specific about the committees he was referring to and questions to his transition team went unanswered. But it?s likely Trump was talking about the House and Senate intelligence committees whose leaders are privy to state secrets and were briefed on the classified report on Thursday. The committees could ostensibly hold hearings or perform an investigation into the leaks. But when Trump tweeted that he would reach out to the committees he hadn?t yet communicated anything to their top members. A spokesperson for Devin Nunes the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of Trump?s own transition team said that Nunes had ?not received an official request on this yet. ? Neither had Adam Schiff the Democratic ranking member of the same committee and an outspoken Trump critic according to a representative. There was also no outreach to Mark Warner the Democratic   of the Senate Intelligence Committee a spokesperson said. The office of Richard Burr the Republican chair of that committee did not respond to a request for comment by press time. Schiff replied to Trump?s tweet shortly after it was sent criticizing him for pursuing misplaced priorities by focusing on the leak: Of all issues implicated by Russian active measures this is what you want to investigate? This is your top priority for intel committees? https:  .  And although Trump called for an investigation into the leaks ?prior to [him] seeing? the intelligence community?s report the Associated Press reported that the Director of National Intelligence and the heads of the FBI and the CIA arrived at Trump Tower at 1 p. m. Friday to deliver the classified briefing. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on Russia?s role in hacking Democratic operatives and organizations. He?s questioned the intelligence community?s abilities and motivations calling the focus on   hacking a ?political witch hunt? in an interview with The New York Times on Friday just hours before he was set to receive the   briefing. Now as he?s being clued into the spy agencies? classified findings he?s looking to deflect attention from the report itself onto its leak to the press.
474,73321,Run the Jewels? Gloriously Obscene Rebellion,Atlantic,Spencer Kornhaber,1/6/2017,2017,1,,   ?Welcome to fuckyoupalooze?   offers on Run the Jewels 3 and it might as well be the album?s alternate title. Since the initial 2013   of the rappers Killer Mike and   Run the Jewels have built a rep as fierce protest musicians but their work is best understood as an omnidirectional middle finger. Over the course of their latest release they threaten nuns bunny rabbits ?moms from jazzercise? and general politeness: ?I don?t know how to not spit like a lout?   says adding ?I?ll spill a pound of my kids on your couch. ? It would seem like a good moment for loutish spitting given the tenor of online discourse and given the    headed to the Oval Office. Not long ago Run the Jewels came across as total outsiders with the smart sorrowful conscience of Atlanta?s Killer Mike and the   agitation of Brooklyn?s   combining for a vibe out of step with the rap mainstream and much of American popular culture. But lately their finely detailed    bombast seems strangely  : In style if not in substance they indulge the rush of giddy combative pessimism on the rise for both sides of the ideological spectrum. A Tribe Called Quest and the Shadow of Trump To be clear they stand firmly on the left side of that spectrum.   stopped wearing red hats because of Donald Trump Killer Mike worked as a Bernie Sanders surrogate. But Mike also opposed Hillary Clinton throughout the general election saying she was ?the same? as her opponent and alternately issuing ?stay the fuck home? and ?vote locally? messages to black people in the campaign?s final days. He?s possibly the leading cultural champion of the    mindset that took such a hold on portions of the traditional Democratic base that it may have swung the election and he?s not softening now. ?Choose the lesser of the evil people and the devil still gon? win? he raps. ?It could all be over tomorrow kill our masters and start again. ? The fantasy of erasing the powerful and starting society again of justice achieved through total rupture has always been essential to the thrill of Run the Jewels? music. It?s in the mechanized warfare of  ?s production where   textures click and clack over propulsion recalling The Prodigy?s angry breakbeats. It?s in the  .  verbal teamwork creating rhyme patterns and   that are complementary   and out of step with what you?re hearing elsewhere. And it?s in the   lyrics that swirl raunch and introspection and agitprop. Run the Jewels 3 is the longest of their releases ?  14 songs 51 minutes ?  and it must be said their shtick at this scale does become a bit repetitive. Still the highlights are enormous. ?Down? makes a poignant start putting the entire Run the Jewels project into perspective by establishing how a desperate past can color someone?s successful present. Over downbeat washes of sound Mike talks about his fear of having to return to drug dealing and summarizes the Bill of Rights as it most urgently pertains to those like him: ?One time for the freedom of speeches   Two time for the right to hold heaters   Just skip to the fifth with the cops in the house close your mouth and pray to your Jesus. ? From there the duo vaults through a series of brag jams that double as   sessions the musical geography defined less by verses and choruses than by clusters of epic moments. One comes when a deadpan female voice interrupts  ?s claim about what?s between his legs: ?I got a unicorn horn for a ?  ?stop. ?? Another comes as the beat switches between the songs ?Legend Has It? and ?Call Ticketron? the latter a   rave spiked with snippets of old commercials for Madison Square Garden seats. While the swagger often betrays a political sensibility ?  Mike: ?Domain eminent we the preeminent? ?  eventually they shift back into more serious solemn modes. It?s especially solemn and memorable when the two give their own individual spins on grief for ?Thursday in the Danger Room. ? As is typical   focuses more on self and Mike more on community but both deliver potent testimony. Earlier the spacey ?2100? contemplates pending civilizational catastrophes with the title hinting either at the date of total disaster or of   repair ?  though in Run the Jewels? worldview of course these can be the same thing. The talk of inevitable holocaust and war hits hard after say recent famous tweets about nukes but the song was written before the election and the sentiment has been the same all along for the band. ?I?ve felt this dread pretty much my entire life?   told Vulture. ?I think we live in a bit of a bubble here. And that bubble?s popping. Everybody?s like ?Holy shit things might not be fine if we turn the TV off. ?? Throughout the rappers display South   disregard for decorum most especially on the religious defilement anthem ?Panther Like a Panther. ? This obscenity isn?t simple hijinks to hear them tell it it?s a side effect of political bravery.  ?I?m a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose? Killer Mike raps.  ?s take: ?You talk clean and bomb hospitals   So I speak with the foulest mouth possible. ? Is this stuff actually going to shock people out of complacency? Maybe a few. But Run the Jewels raps first for its   fanbase and the people who shell out for remix albums made entirely of cat meows are presumably already converted. The spectacle of       rhetoric works best to cinch performer and listener a dynamic that?s   these days ?  even outside of music.
475,73322,Why Employers Are Rolling Back Raises,Atlantic,Adam Chandler,1/6/2017,2017,1,,Just a few weeks ago over four million Americans were poised to benefit from new overtime regulations at the start of the new year. The new rule ?  which would require     pay for those working more than 40 hours a week ?  was part of an executive order signed by President Obama in 2016. The order would have effectively doubled the salary threshold for mandatory overtime pay from $23 660 to $47 476 ?  forcing employers to either pay many more workers overtime or bump their salaries beyond the reach of the threshold. But with a new administration poised to take over it looks like many of those workers won?t be getting higher pay after all. The implementation of the executive order was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Texas back in November and is now expected to be fully undone by Obama?s successor   Donald Trump. While it?s not certain that Trump will roll back the  measure ?  which would aid the many of the   voters that elected him ?  the  ?s nomination of   executive Andy Puzder as his labor secretary suggests it?s a likely bet. As my colleague Alexia Campbell noted last month Puzder has been a vocal critic of Obama?s overtime order saying that the measure ?will simply add to the extensive regulatory maze the Obama Administration has imposed on employers forcing many to offset increased labor expense by cutting costs elsewhere. ? Some employers aren?t waiting for official word from the federal government and have in several cases canceled raises that were meant to push workers salaries above the overtime threshold. ?The clawbacks seem mainly to have occurred at nonprofits and smaller   businesses? Politico?s Ted Hesson reported on Tuesday. According to Hesson raises related to overtime have been rescinded at Massachusetts General Hospital Iowa State University the University of Iowa Michigan State University Rutgers University the University of North Carolina Wilmington Wayne State University in Michigan and the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. The expansion of overtime pay is a microcosm of the battling philosophies that animated voters during the 2016 election. Republicans including Trump and Puzder have characterized the rule as a   regulation a hubristic act of bureaucratic overreach. Obama and Hillary Clinton who supported the order touted it as a small analgesic for underpaid and     workers. Like those currently insured under the Affordable Care Act or protected by immigration measures like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Americans impacted by the overtime pay rule ?  or the raises to avoid it ?  may see their plans upended by the transition of presidential power. But unlike those awaiting the federal government?s decisions on ACA or DACA decisions about many pay raises can be made by independently by employers without government policy. Some employers will choose to   with existing salary hikes: As The Washington Post reported last month Walmart says it plans to keep the pay raises it instituted for   manager salaries. In September the retailer bumped pay for the position to $48 500 up from $45 000 in order to avoid the   threshold. But others who were once promised similar raises may not be as lucky.
476,73323,Obama Was Too Good at Social Media,Atlantic,Ian Bogost,1/6/2017,2017,1,,President Obama has been called the ?first   president. ? It?s both a true and a misleading characterization. On the one hand the Obama White House was indeed the first presidency to make use of services like Twitter Facebook Snapchat and Instagram. But on the other hand these services either didn?t exist or weren?t used by a broad public before Barack Obama took office in 2009. The White House brags that Obama was the first to tweet from @POTUS on Twitter to go live on Facebook to use a filter on Snapchat. But in truth any president in office during the last eight years probably would have become the first   president. That doesn?t mean that any president would have been good at it however. John F. Kennedy is widely considered the first television president but he wasn?t the first one to appear on TV. Franklin Roosevelt was the first president to appear on television and Truman was the first in 1947 to make a televised presidential address. But it was Kennedy who mastered the medium starting with his famous televised debate with Richard Nixon in 1960 and continuing with the televised news conferences and interviews that characterized his presidency. Like JFK was good at TV Obama is good at social media. Before his presidency Obama was already inseparable from his BlackBerry and as a   ?nerd? and ?geek? his interest in science and technology helped spur his administration to pursue and manage public communication and engagement with today?s digital services and tools. But what if Obama was too good at social media? Maybe America didn?t need a   president but a president whose technological savvy could apply to legislation and governance as much as public communication. * * * Last October the White House announced a ?digital transition? ?  the process by which the Obama presidency would hand over the reins to its various   accounts their followers kept intact while also resetting and archiving their former contents in compliance with the Presidential Records Act. Normally such preservation seals materials up in physical repositories such as those maintained at the National Archives or the various presidential libraries. But the Obama White House hoped to ?ensure these materials continue to be accessible on the platforms where they were created? a savvy acknowledgement of the fact that a tweet or an Instagram post doesn?t make sense stripped from its context. In addition to these expected steps the White House also expressed its commitment to share its   content with the American people ?  both via accessible downloadable archives where possible and also through tools and gadgets that might present the content in new and synthetic ways. In service of the latter goal the White House invited the public to submit ?creative ways to archive this content and make it both useful and available for years to come. ? The White House demonstrated remarkable astuteness toward this end both culturally and rhetorically. It explicitly invited ?students data engineers artists and researchers? to contribute ?  just the communities likely to feel adept and engaged with the technological sphere. It reaffirmed that the Obama administration was up on the latest trends suggesting Twitter bots query tools and metadata services as examples of possible submissions. It used keywords commensurate with the values and rhetoric of the technology community. And most importantly it issued the call in the form of a   contest of sorts: submissions were to be completed ?no later than   [2016]? or about two months after the call was first issued. History is slow but technology is fast. Despite the real purpose of a presidential archive ?  to produce an accessible record for posterity ?  The White House knew that urgency would give it one last chance to tout Obama?s technological acumen to the public. The results are now in. This week the White House announced the ?innovative? archival projects they selected from the December submissions. And for anyone who follows and enjoys technology services the results are indeed delightful. The GIF search engine Giphy created a landing page for   animated GIFs and White House Vines (the   short video service that shut down last fall). The archiving platform ArchiveSocial launched a search engine that consolidates queries across all the White House social media platforms. Students at the University of Texas Austin and NYU?s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) announced plans for an ?Obamathon? hackathon to take place today. And the creative technology studio Feel Train announced @Relive44 a Twitter account that will repost White House tweets in real time over the next eight years. The MIT Media Lab?s Electome project offers a visualization of how @POTUS communicated with citizens. The language White House Office of Digital Strategy Director of Product Management (and former Facebook employee) Joshua Miller used to announce the projects could just as easily  have been penned by a Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur in a Kickstarter campaign or a Medium post. Innovation is celebrated along with the wherewithal of students companies and organizations to ?answer this call to action? to tell the story of how the Obama presidency has used digital platforms for civic engagement. As is common practice in politics as much as technology the unpaid labor of volunteers is heralded as the great promise of the current and future historical project. The White House hopes Miller writes ?that their creations would inspire people (like you) to dive into the archives themselves. ? In its final act the first Social Media presidency offers an Obamaesque nod to the values of the technology industry it used to the point of obsession. * * * To sneer at the White House?s efforts in this regard is sure to make me seem like a spoilsport or a killjoy. Haven?t you been charmed by the Barack and Michelle GIFs at GIPHY? Won?t you find Feel Train?s performance of Obama?s tweets both tender and wry in their future juxtapositions? Will ArchiveSocial?s search tool not prove useful to amateur and professional historians alike? Yes of course. But these projects also affirm the dark underbelly of the social media era. The compression of complex ideas into tweetable  . The victory of sentiment and affect over reason and fact on the internet. The belief that large information archives can produce knowledge of the present and of history by exalting data correlation over all other methods of knowledge production. The tendency to privilege technological discourse over all other topics. The celebration of   contests and hackathons pursued with an entrepreneur?s   attention as the ultimate means of invention. The silent privileging of those with the time and resources to jump at the invitation to work for free on no notice over a period of weeks to curry favor and attention. For all the tweets and Facebook posts and YouTube videos and Pinterest pins and Snapchat snaps the Obama White House produced and disseminated the main work it did was to further establish the unquestioned utility and righteousness of digital communications technology in the modern era. Citizens are dazzled and drawn to an image of Barack Obama staring into a smartphone or looped in a short GIF or Vine because such images condone and affirm their own fixation with these technologies. Even when those technologies dramatically alter civic and personal life as companies like Facebook Google and Twitter have also done since 2008. As Obama leaves office the digital tools he quietly celebrated have also hollowed out American life. Surveillance capitalism has made data extraction aggregation resale and speculation the hidden engine of wealth and progress (for those few fortunate enough to pursue rather than to be pursued by it). The ability to create and widely disseminate information as credible and accurate no matter its relationship to reality. The obsession with immediacy and attention over longevity and conviction. The consolidation of media and information particularly local media in the hands of a few large companies with limited commitment to civic good. While the first social media presidency was busy tweeting and Snapchatting supposedly for public engagement it did precious little to address the impacts of these and other effects of technology on the American public as matters of public policy. Ultimately history will judge the 44th president online and off. But instead of the ?first social media presidency? I wonder if Obama?s legacy won?t instead be that of the ?cool dad presidency. ? What people liked about Obama?s relationship to technology is that it was so much like their own. Obama was relatable and  . He clutched his smartphone as much as anyone. He could make a post go viral and deserve it. But maybe what America needed from 2009 to 2017 wasn?t a cool dad to tweet and stream alongside its citizens. Maybe it needed a guardian to watch and safeguard it against its own worst habits.
477,73324,Obama?s Anger Translator Takes a Final Bow,Atlantic,Megan Garber,1/6/2017,2017,1,,There?s perhaps been no better satire of the Obama presidency than the figure of Luther Obama?s anger translator. Key  Peele?s serialized sketch in which the title character says all the things Obama won?t and can?t say as president was multifaceted in its insights: about the performative demands of the office about Obama?s own cool demeanor about the collision of all those things in the person of the country?s first black president. Key  Peele?s Luther sketches ?  including and perhaps especially the one performed with the actual President Obama at the 2015 White House Correspondents? Dinner ?  were in all that as profound as they were wacky and as much about the country Obama governed as they were about the president himself. Since that country elected a new president in November Key  Peele fans have been clamoring for a return of the character ?  to ?translate? the calm hopeful messages Obama has been sending about the transition into some angry (and in that cathartic)  . On Thursday evening during   Key?s appearance on The Daily Show they got their wish: After a brief conversation with Trevor Noah Key introduced the sketch he had made with Jordan Peele ?  one in which Peele?s ?Obama? gives his final address to the nation as its president. One in which Luther as always is there to translate. Trevor Noah Finds His   Voice It?s everything you?d expect of such a sketch expertly executed. Obama informs Luther to keep calm Luther is completely unable to do so. ?Don?t you understand?? Luther asks. ?This is how The Hunger Games starts!? To Obama?s exhortations that now someone else will be calling the shots Luther screams ?Yeah! Vladimir Putin!? To the president?s reminder that ?it was a close election but the people have spoken? Luther replies ?Yeah! They voted for Hillary Clinton but then this outdated electoral college   voodoo bull[bleep]!? and walks out of the room in uncontainable exasperation. To Obama?s note that ?it?s more imperative than ever that we move on as a country united? Luther replies ?united in the fact that we can?t [bleep] stand each other!? So the   Luther sketch is made mostly the stuff of the   versions: ?No drama Obama? next to the      Luther. But as the sketch wraps up ?  as ?Obama? concludes his farewell address to the nation ?  the whole thing pivots. It?s Obama who gets angry. It?s Obama who more significantly no longer feels the need to disguise that anger. When Luther excoriates the new president?s immigration policy ?  ?the only good immigrant is a   white one!? ?  Obama ads ?who plagiarizes speeches. ? Luther stands in a moment of stunned silence as he realizes that the president has left nothing for him to translate. Later Obama mentions the tradition of the outgoing president leaving the incoming one a note in the desk of the Oval Office offering advice. The contents of that note have been confidential Obama says ?until now. ? Luther grabs the note out of the president?s hand and reveals that the message Obama has left to President Trump reads ?Go [bleep] yourself. ? It was for a series of sketches that has always operated on several dimensions a fitting conclusion: In Luther?s (ostensibly) final appearance he cedes his outrage to the president himself ?  who soon to be freed of the many constraints of his office seems to be out of patience with the requirement that he keep his cool. After eight years of partisan gamesmanship and eight years of stoicism Key  Peele?s version of Obama has had it with all the  . He no longer needs someone to translate his anger. ?In summation? the outgoing president tells the nation ?it?s been real. It?s been good. But it hasn?t been real good. ?
478,73325,Why Do Humans Still Have a Gene That Increases the Risk of Alzheimer?s?,Atlantic,Ed Yong,1/6/2017,2017,1,,When the former nurse Jamie Tyrone learned that she carried two copies of a gene called ApoE4 she ?lost hope and direction? and her ?days were filled with fear anxiety and sadness. ? It meant that as she got older she would likely develop Alzheimer?s disease as her father had done before her. The apoliprotein E gene or ApoE comes in three forms ?  E2 E3 and E4. The last one is the problem. People who carry one copy have a   higher risk of Alzheimer?s than those with none. And those with two copies as Tyrone carries have   to   higher risks. Between 51 and 68 percent of them will develop the disease by the time they are 85. The risk is so large that some people who get their genomes analyzed (including James Watson a   of the DNA double helix) deliberately decide to redact their ApoE4 sequence. They?d rather not know.   Even if ApoE4 carriers manage to dodge Alzheimer?s they aren?t out of the woods. Compared to the general population they tend to have higher cholesterol levels a higher risk of heart disease and a faster pace of mental decline during old age. Despite all these drawbacks the ApoE4 variant is surprisingly common. A quarter of white Americans carry a single copy as do more than a third of African Americans. In other parts of the world especially in the tropics and in northern Europe the variant is even more common. ?It doesn?t make sense? says Ben Trumble from Arizona State University. ?You?d have thought that natural selection would have weeded out ApoE4 a long time ago. The fact that we have it at all is a little bizarre. ? Trumble has now found an answer to this puzzle after studying the Tsimane a group of indigenous people from the Bolivian Amazon. They live traditional lifestyles involving   horticulture fishing and foraging. They don?t have access to sanitation or running water and more than   of them are infected with worms and other intestinal parasites. Among the Tsimane with the heaviest parasite burdens ApoE4 actually protects against mental decline in old age. The variant has been described by some publication as ?the forgetting gene? but that?s because scientists have mostly studied it in Western and Asian populations. Among the   Tsimane it?s more of a ?the remembering gene. ? Trumble?s team has been studying the Tsimane since 1999 to see how their health compares to people from urban Western societies. He and his colleagues travel between the 90 or so communities with a team of Bolivian doctors and biochemists and a few Tsimane whom they trained as anthropologists. They draw blood collect stool samples and do medical exams. They check for parasite infections by measuring levels of immune cells. And recently they interviewed 372 villagers between the ages of 6 and 88 giving them a battery of tests designed to measure their attention memory and other mental skills.   Among the Tsimane as a whole adults with E4 got poorer scores in these tests. But when the team focused on the people with high parasite levels they saw that the E4 carriers had better mental skills even outperforming E3 carriers who were  .   It?s not clear why. The ApoE gene affects the movement of cholesterol and fatty acids through the brain. Perhaps the E4 variant keeps these nutrients away from parasites and so keeps their populations in check. That might in turn protect the brain. ?Having parasites is bad for cognitive performance? says Trumble. ?If you?re having to spend a bunch of energy on ramping up your immune system those are calories you can?t spend on growth. ?   Even with 372 volunteers the team?s study is small but they?ve been working to increase their numbers by almost four times. ?That?s the big problem with   studies? says Trumble. ?In most   populations there just aren?t enough older individuals. The Tsimane are an interesting test case because more than 1 300 are over 40. And since they have no birth control and now access to metal axes and motorized canoes they?re growing faster than the baby boom in the U. S. That?s one of the reasons we started working with them. ? ?It?s consistent with other studies indicating that E4 isn?t always the bad guy? says Ruth Itzhaki from the University of Manchester whose own work showed that E4 might protect against liver damage caused by hepatitis C. Other researchers have found that   children in Brazilian shanty towns did better in mental tests when carrying intestinal parasites while those in Mexico City were better able to cope with lead exposure. This doesn?t explain why E4 remains common in many Western populations but it does at least hint that the variant might be beneficial in other contexts that we haven?t discovered. Indeed E4 seems to be the original version of the ApoE gene which existed at the dawn of humanity before the E2 and E3 versions arose. For most of our history we had to cope with parasites galore and perhaps the E4 variant helped our ancestors to cope with that burden as it seems to do in today?s Tsimane. And perhaps the variant?s benefits that have since diminished as some societies embraced sanitation clean water and refrigeration. ?This highlights the importance of accounting for the wide variety of environments in which humans lived for most of our evolution and in which we currently live? says Trumble. ?  city life is just a blip in our history. ?
479,73326,Trump vs. the Spies,Atlantic,AmyZegart,1/6/2017,2017,1,,Something stunning happened on Capitol Hill yesterday: Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Armed Services Committee practically stood shoulder to shoulder with senior officials from the U. S. intelligence community as they declared that America?s spies were right after all: The Russian government sought to interfere in the U. S. presidential election by hacking into   email and leaking information. It was a striking bipartisan rebuke to   Donald Trump who has consistently cast skepticism on allegations of Russian involvement and seemed to disparage the intelligence community. Perhaps in anticipation of that committee hearing Trump was already backpedaling on Twitter before it started declaring ?The media lies to make it look like I am against ?Intelligence? when in fact I am a big fan!? What Did the Senate Hearing Reveal About Russian Hacking? Trump?s ?never mind? tweet is unlikely to repair the dangerous breach between the incoming president and the intelligence agencies that serve him. Presidents often throw intelligence agencies under the bus when they fail. Never before has a   thrown them under the bus for succeeding. But that?s exactly what Trump has been doing for weeks in an unrelenting frenzy. Since his election Trump has spent more time fighting Langley than ISIS. He has called the CIA?s assessment of the Russian government?s role in election hacking ?ridiculous? and has insisted repeatedly that the culprit could be anyone including a   hacker or ?somebody sitting in a bed some place. ? His transition team has disparaged and discredited the CIA as ?the same people who thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction? ?  even though they aren?t the same people Russian cyber hacking isn?t the same intelligence target as Iraq WMD the Iraq failure was 14 years ago and intelligence agencies have radically overhauled their analytic process since then. The   has also said he won?t bother getting daily intelligence briefings ?  making him the first president since   to skip them ?  because he?s smart. And just a day before Trump declared himself an intelligence fan The Wall Street Journal reported that his team was cooking up a   scheme to purge the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence of suspected politicization in the ranks by trimming and reorganizing both agencies. (The Trump team has denied this report which was based on the accounts of sources ?familiar with the planning? including at least one close to the transition.) With fans like this who needs enemies? Some skepticism toward intelligence is healthy. And tension between presidents and their intelligence agencies is nothing new. Lyndon Johnson was said to compare the intelligence community to his boyhood cow Bessie who would swing her ?shit smeared? tail through a bucket of milk as soon as he?d finished milking her. Bill Clinton met so infrequently with his CIA Director Jim Woolsey that when a plane crashed on the White House lawn aides joked that it was Woolsey trying to get a meeting. (Woolsey incidentally had been advising the Trump transition team until resigning yesterday reportedly due to ?growing tensions over Trump?s vision for intelligence agencies. ?) Nearly all presidents leave office disappointed and disgruntled with their intelligence apparatus for two reasons: because presidents want crystal balls and even the CIA?s smartest people don?t have them and because presidents resort to covert operations for the toughest of problems when all else fails ?  which is why covert operations usually fail too. But no president until now has entered office with such a profound publicly vented distrust of his own intelligence establishment. Trump?s doubts are both understandable and alarming. Understandable because we live in an era where threats are moving faster than bureaucrats and where hacks tweets leaks and internet ?news? (both real and fake) make information available everywhere all the time instantly. In this digital age it is reasonable to ask just what America?s intelligence community still brings to the table. The answer is a lot. U. S. intelligence agencies have one overriding mission: giving the president   advantage in a dangerous and deceptive world. Intelligence officials risk their lives to recruit foreign assets they intercept foreign email and   communications they build and deploy spy satellites they track obscure foreign government reports and trends for vital clues about the stability of a regime or the health of a foreign economy. Sure you can find a Wikipedia page on just about anything these days. Where intelligence agencies add value is by integrating the best   information and integrating it with the secret nuggets they gather. All intelligence is information. But not all information is intelligence. Agencies like the CIA or NSA sort through a crushing daily stream of information and marry it with secrets to yield insights that keep Americans safe and advance the country?s national interests. Do they get it wrong sometimes? Of course. In 1962 just weeks before an American   spy plane discovered unmistakable evidence of Soviet nuclear missile installations in Cuba the intelligence community completed an assessment that concluded the Soviets would not dare place missiles in Cuba. Today Americans remember the   photos but forget the intelligence failure that preceded them and led the United States to the nuclear brink. The intelligence failures of   and Iraq WMD are still fresh and searing. But castigating intelligence officials because they don?t succeed every time is like saying Stephen Curry is a terrible NBA basketball player because he doesn?t make every   shot he takes. Intelligence agencies are paid to pierce the fog of the future as best they can. They tackle the toughest targets ?  trying to divine the capabilities and intentions of adversaries who hide in caves send children to be suicide bombers enrich uranium in secret underground facilities seek space weapons that could destroy GPS and every digital system people use and would detonate a nuclear bomb in a New York minute to take out New York City if they ever got one. As one former senior intelligence official told me if the intelligence community is getting it right 100 percent of the time then they should be fired because they aren?t asking hard enough questions. This is serious business and intelligence agencies take it deadly seriously. They are the silent warriors of America. There?s no holiday in their honor. There?s no big public memorial on the National Mall. There are no Air Force flyovers or standing ovations at football games for them. There are only unmarked stars on the walls at Langley and Fort Meade honoring those at CIA and NSA who died in silent service to their country. Mr. Trump should visit those walls and feel their sacrifice. Better yet he should honor America?s intelligence professionals by listening to what they have to say ?  starting with the daily intelligence briefing. The president cannot afford to delegate intelligence briefings to underlings in today?s threat environment for three reasons that Mr. Trump should know well from his experience in the business world. First nothing generates knowledge and results like    meetings. That?s why CEOs fly around the world to meet in person instead of Skyping. Whether in the boardroom or the Oval Office good briefings are   interactions that build trust and insight. They?re golden moments for a senior intelligence official to converse with the nation?s leader to better understand what?s on his mind what he wants to know what he finds unconvincing and how the vast assets of the intelligence community can better serve him. Second good briefings inform ?  they arm the    with a view of what matters right now and what could matter tomorrow so that he isn?t surprised. Because in foreign policy surprises are never the good kind. Third and finally the daily briefing boosts morale. It says to the men and women of the intelligence community ?you matter. ? Nothing signals importance like minutes of the president?s schedule. Given the dangers America confronts the nation needs the intelligence community now more than ever. The 45th president needs to show that he thinks so too.
480,73327,Obama?s Final Jobs Report Marks 75 Consecutive Months of Growth,Atlantic,Bourree Lam,1/6/2017,2017,1,,The final jobs report for 2016 shows that the U. S. economy has added just over 2 million jobs last year. The Labor Department reported on Friday morning that the U. S. economy added 156 000 jobs in December while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4. 7 percent. The numbers slightly missed expectations: Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting 183 000 jobs to be added. Nevertheless the December jobs report concludes a year of steady economic growth: For most of the year the unemployment rate has been hovering just under 5 percent the lowest levels since 2007. Although the pace of employment growth in 2016 slowed compared to 2014 and 2015 ?  the height of the economic recovery ?  last year?s numbers put outgoing President Barack Obama ahead of George W. Bush (but behind Bill Clinton) when it comes to job creation. In 2009 when Obama took office the U. S. labor market was facing   unemployment ?  the highest since the early 1980s recession ?  and job losses due to the financial crisis. In January of 2009 ?  the month Obama was inaugurated ?  the American economy lost 791 000 jobs. Now ?  eight years later ?  the U. S. has experienced 75 consecutive months of job growth. ?When President Obama took office we were losing 800 000 jobs a month. The job loss associated with the Great Recession was enormous but a record long recovery has put people back to work including the   unemployed and those who left the labor force? said Betsey Stevenson a labor economist at the University of Michigan and former member of Obama?s Council of Economic Advisors in an email. ?Unemployment is low wages are rising and     participation is recovering. ? Wages were an especially important indicator in 2016 since the improving labor market should theoretically increase pay for American workers. There?s been some improvement on that front: In December average hourly earnings reached a high of $26. 00 compared with $24. 76 in January of this year. For the year wage growth amounted to 2. 9 percent ?  the strongest since the recession. Harry Holzer former chief economist of the U. S. Department of Labor and author of Where Are All The Good Jobs Going? echoed Stevenson?s sentiments. ?The job market has almost totally recovered from its devastating decline during the Great Recession   ?     significant wage growth which was lacking early in the recovery has returned? he said in an email. Job creation has been particularly good in the private sector. ?During the past 8 years the labor market has steadily created jobs ?  adding 11 million jobs. Today the labor market is tightening and we are approaching near ? said Ahu Yildirmaz the lead economist and head of ADP Research Institute (which puts together the   jobs report). Yildirmaz says that according to ADP?s data small and   companies in the U. S. created the most jobs since 2008. Still several sectors ?  such as energy and manufacturing ?  continue to struggle. Stevenson says that the trouble in these sectors will require innovative ways of approaching the changing job market. ?The challenge for the future will be solving the mismatch between the types of jobs people used to have and the types of jobs the economy is currently creating? she said. When he takes office later this month   Donald Trump will be inheriting a strong economy. During the campaign Trump often painted a dire portrait of the American economy despite statistics showing a strong labor market an increase in American household incomes and rising consumer confidence. Critics of Obama?s job market performance often point to the drop in   participation and the rise in underemployment as weak spots in the U. S. labor market as proof that there?s still room for improvement. While   participation has seen some declines in the past few years it was steady throughout the year. In December it hovered at 62. 7 percent which is near a   low. The root cause of declining participation remains disputed with demographics and discouraged workers cited as some of the possible explanations. In 2017 the   participation number will likely remain a major focus. ?About half of the decline reflects Baby Boomers whose retirements we anticipated it?s the other half among   workers that we worry about most? said Holzer. ?It is possible that the   participation rate among   workers might improve just a bit more. But the improvements will be limited for two reasons: First we are approaching the limit in labor supply of workers who are available and who have the skills needed for existing openings and second growth in demand will be limited as interest rates rise. ? Yildirmaz at ADP also points to the limits in labor supply: ?The greatest challenge employers will face in 2017 will be finding skilled workers in the tightening labor market? says Yildirmaz. A recent ADP study found that 80 percent of employers believe their top management challenges stem from the shortage of skilled workers. Overall 2016 has been a good year for the U. S. labor market. Looking forward to 2017 there?s evidence that the job market can continue to gain strength. Some economists expect that   Trump?s promised fiscal stimulus will bring   job growth. But with the Federal Reserve likely raising interest rates to keep inflation in check the impact of the stimulus on   growth might be hampered. In the recently released minutes of the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting members said that potential fiscal stimulus from the new administration would inform how the committee chooses to adjust interest rates in the future.
481,73328,Ranked: Twitter Wars That Came a Little Too Close to Real Wars,Atlantic,Matt Peterson,1/6/2017,2017,1,,A fun new feature of 2017 is that Twitter is getting a lot more dangerous. With Donald Trump leading the charge individuals who control actual armies have started shooting from the hip on social media. We are yet to see a real war come out of a Twitter war but at the rate we?re going it won?t be long. Here are five instances in which politicians ratcheted up global tensions in 140 characters or less. 5. Iran menaces Obama. In 2015 Iran?s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tweeted an image of a man resembling Barack Obama holding a gun to his head: ?We welcome no war nor do we initiate any war but. .. ? The threat falls into the category of calculated menace: aggressive to be sure but given the intense focus by all sides on the state of U. S.  relations it would be hard for words to spill over into   actions. At least it?s been hard under the Obama administration. 2017 may be different. 2016: The Year in Quotes 4. Greece snaps at Turkey. In the midst of a diplomatic uproar after Turkey shot down a Russian plane flying missions in Syria Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras ?  or someone with access to his Twitter account ?  decided to escalate matters further. In a series of   tweets Tspiras alluded to shooting down Turkish planes that violated Greek airspace: ?Fortunately our pilots are not as mercurial as yours. ? The Turkish leader apparently having enough on his hands with the Russians all but rolled his eyes and urged a focus on the positive agenda. The path from tweet to war is a long one in this case but when your neighbor is actively shooting down airplanes it might be wise not to stick up your hand and say ?Me too!? 3.   erupts. Tensions spiked last fall when Baghdad started to vigorously protest the presence of uninvited Turkish troops in northern Iraq. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in characteristically undiplomatic style chose to respond by insulting Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   insisting that the Iraqi is ?not on my level. ? Abadi responded on Twitter: ?we sure are not your equal because we liberate our land with men not via Skype. ? That low blow referred to the video call Erdogan made at the height of last summer?s coup attempt against him when he was trying to rally his supporters. Compared to U. S.  relations the danger is more real here as   tensions could more easily escalate. Though the dispute remains unresolved the two have opted to take their arguments offline and have since spoken by phone. 2. Pakistan threatens Israel. Late last month Pakistan?s defense minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif apparently read a fake news story alleging that Israel would nuke Pakistan if Islamabad sent troops into Syria. Ignoring the absurdity of the premise Asif took to Twitter to warn his Israeli counterpart: ?Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear state too. ? The Israelis wrote back attempting to   and Asif ultimately thought better of it and deleted his tweet. But the danger in this type of incident is particularly acute: Unlike Khamenei?s calculated aggression in the Pakistani case someone in power reacted online without thinking. That?s how accidental escalation happens. 1. Trump goes nuclear. 2017 is shaping up to be a year of resurgent nuclear politics. Exhibit A is this recent Trump tweet: ?The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. ? Though Trump?s precise meaning is in dispute ?  arguably he could be referring to modernizing the nuclear arsenal ?  political scientists will tell you it doesn?t matter. If states with nuclear weapons and those that aspire to join the club perceive that an arms race is likely they have incentives to join the race so to avoid being left behind. Plus the  ?s words alone force the U. S. national security community to focus on nuclear weapons. Is it too late to suggest that we #nevertweet?

Thousands and thousands of gers. These are the homes of around 600 000 former herders who ?  like Altansukh ?  have migrated to the Mongolian capital in the past three decades.

President Vladimir Putin who has overtly stated his aversion to revolution has been trying to come up with a way to celebrate the one that defined modern Russia. It?s a far cry from what Soviet leaders thought this year would be. Back in the U. S. S.

A high school degree can give them more economic freedom and a chance to forge their own lives perhaps by enabling them to attend a university or get jobs that require more skills. Yet one estimate says that only about one in three girls attended secondary school between 2008 and 2012 and pregnancy is among the biggest hurdles.

483,73330,Silence Is Easier to Admire Than to Love,Atlantic,Christopher Orr,1/6/2017,2017,1,,   Silence the new film by Martin Scorsese opens with almost as literal a vision of Hell as one could imagine. The year is 1633 the place a craggy volcanic expanse near Nagasaki called Unzen. Through the sulphur fumes and scalding vapor we see European men their hands tied being led by Japanese soldiers to the boiling springs that dot the landscape. Their robes are parted and searing water poured on their skin. In voiceover it is explained that the ladles used are perforated such that each individual drop may strike the skin ?like a burning coal. ? The springs themselves are called aptly enough jogoku or ?hells. ? The man narrating this excruciating torture is Father Cristvo Ferreira (Liam Neeson) a Jesuit missionary. The victims who number in the dozens are his fellow Catholic priests. Christianity has been outlawed as a threat to Japanese culture and it is being burned out of the country in the most direct manner available. Martin Scorsese?s Radical Act of Turning Theology Into Art  Father Ferreira?s observations are committed to a letter and it is in that context that we hear them again. It is now 1640 seven years after the horrors he recounted and a senior Jesuit (Ciarn Hinds) is reading the letter to two young priests who were once Ferreira?s pupils Sebastio Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver). The elder priest also informs them that Ferreira subsequently disappeared and is rumored to have ?apostatized? ?  that is renounced God. Rodrigues and Garupe refuse to believe this of their beloved mentor and they vow to find him and dispel the slander. Their superior accedes to their mission though he reminds them of the extraordinary danger they will face from the moment they set foot in Japan: ?You will be the last two priests ever sent. ? Silence is based on the celebrated 1966 novel of the same name by Sh?saku End? and Scorsese has been vowing to bring it to the big screen ever since he first read the book in 1989. At the time he was dealing with the blowback to his controversial The Last Temptation of Christ and in End??s story of faith and doubt he felt echoes of both his recent experience and his longtime relationship with the Church of which he had once intended to become a priest. Nearly 30 years in the making Silence is a heartfelt and serious work. But through length and redundancy ?  both no doubt the product of Scorsese?s deep admiration for End? ?  as well as an underwhelming central performance by Garfield it ultimately falls short of its powerful ambitions. The two priests Rodrigues and Garupe are smuggled into Japan by Kichijiro (Y?suke Kubozuka) a fickle and intemperate drunk. (There is a noticeable echo of the legendary Toshiro Mifune in the performance.) There they encounter a town populated by secret Christians and their mission begins to shift from finding and rescuing Ferreira to ministering to these devout peasants who live in terror of discovery by the authorities. The Japan of these early scenes ?  conjured by the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ?  is a misery of rock and rain in which   villages can hope for little more than not to be swept entirely out to sea. Eventually official ?inquisitors? do come to the town in which the priests are hiding and the two men are forced to split up. For the remainder of the film we follow the journey of Rodrigues as he witnesses atrocities against his fellow Christians ?  crucifixions drownings a beheading ?  grapples with his own faith and is himself captured. Most of all he suffers from the apparent ?silence? with which God answers his prayers. The tradeoff repeatedly extended by the authorities to those suspected of Christian belief would seem a simple one. Just place one?s foot on a   a small plaque bearing a likeness of Christ or the Virgin and one will escape punishment and perhaps be freed. Refuse and one will face torture or worse. Many of the peasants questioned refuse to step on the   and suffer accordingly. But many are willing to make that concession ?  and are in fact encouraged by Rodrigues to do so ?  in order to keep their lives. Among the latter is the priests? initial guide Kichijiro whose continued vacillation between apostasy and confession makes him one of the film?s more infuriating and provocatively human figures. As is no doubt apparent Silence is not an easy film to watch its   running time awash in images of pain and cruelty. But neither is it a mere cinematic exercise in physical endurance or the punishments of the flesh such as Unbroken or even The Revenant. Scorsese is attempting something far more interesting: a portrait of the endurance of the soul. It is not after all Rodrigues?s body that is being tormented but those of the people around him. And it is made abundantly clear that it is within his power to make it stop if only he will himself apostatize. As the chief inquisitor Inoue cunningly played by Issey Ogata explains: ?We learned from our mistakes. Killing priests only makes them stronger. ? Another interrogator puts it still more directly when Rodrigues insists that the victims around him ?didn?t die for nothing. ? ?No? he replies. ?They died for you. ? But for all the torments they inflict the Japanese inquisitors are no generic movie villains. They truly believe that Christianity is incompatible with the Japanese spirit an alien pathogen imported by arrogant and incurious Europeans. And the film gives this case its due. It is notable for instance that none of the Jesuits we encounter speaks more than a tiny smattering of Japanese but peasants and inquisitors alike manage to make themselves understood in Portuguese (rendered in the film as English). One of Rodrigues?s captors ?  played superbly by Tadanobu Asano ?  is fluent enough to function as a   translator. Indeed one of the chief weaknesses of Silence is that so many of the characters in orbit around Rodrigues convey more narrative gravity than he does himself: Asano?s translator Ogata?s inquisitor Kubozuka?s fickle Kichijiro Driver?s Father Garupe a village elder played by Yoshi Oida. Andrew Garfield is a fine actor but his calling card has always been a kind of boyish ingenuousness and here it is tested beyond its limits. Garfield?s previous major role of the year Hacksaw Ridge is illustrative. In it as in Silence he plays a devout Christian ?  one who served as an Army medic in World War II and despite his refusal to carry a firearm rescued 75 of his gravely injured comrades from the battlefield. But in Hacksaw Ridge this Christian spirit was emphatic uplifting a source of   strength. It was the solution to the problem at hand. In Silence by contrast Garfield faces the far heavier challenge of grappling with the possibility that it might be the problem. Far from saving lives Rodrigues?s faith is costing them. Scorsese does Garfield no favors by extending his protagonist?s torments to such extreme lengths. The film is full of moments that for all their elegance and power feel repetitive: yet another scene of peasants being commanded to step on the   another brutal torture another confrontation between Rodrigues and the inquisitors in which each side talks past the other ?  universal truth versus cultural difference ?  without success. These philosophical disputes too rarely achieve the depth or richness for which one hopes. Late in the film it is suggested intriguingly that perhaps the Christian faith of the Japanese peasants isn?t really Christian at all that due to a   error of translation they worship not the ?Son? but the ?Sun. ? Alas Scorsese?s film is more interested in cataloguing Rodrigues?s ongoing spiritual anguishes than in pulling further on such theological threads. It all comes to an end ?  though I should warn there?s still a   left ?  when Rodrigues finally completes his mission and learns the fate of his mentor Father Ferreira. I will not reveal what he discovers but I will say that it feels like a moment that could easily have taken place far earlier in the film. Let there be no misunderstanding: Silence is an indisputably worthy film from one of our greatest living directors one that searchingly tackles questions of faith and doubt and duty. The visuals supplied by Prieto are themselves worth the price of admission ?  the desperate peasants crawling up over the side of a boat like pirates or mermen a town abandoned to a community of feral cats a sea cave that functions like a portal from one world to the next. Scorsese?s abiding passion and respect for his source material is everywhere in evidence. For once perhaps it is a little too great.
484,73331,Mnuchin?s Bank Was Reprimanded by the Same Department He May Lead,Atlantic,Alexia Fernndez Campbell,1/6/2017,2017,1,,In 2011 at the peak of the housing crisis regulators for the Treasury Department ordered Steve Mnuchin and directors at OneWest Bank in California to fix the bank?s questionable handling of home loans. In a consent order filed that year by the department?s Office of Thrift Supervision regulators accused the bank of using ?unsafe or unsound? methods for dealing with mortgage loans and foreclosures in 2009 and 2010. They found that bank employees and   providers lied in foreclosure paperwork filed in state and federal courts about information related to the ownership of many home loans money due on the loans and the fees chargeable to the borrower. They also accused employees of filing court documents with signatures that were not notarized and initiating foreclosures and bankruptcies without all the necessary paperwork. The office additionally claimed that the bank ?failed to devote to its foreclosure processes adequate oversight internal controls policies and procedures compliance risk management internal audit third party management and training. ? As a result of the examination the Treasury Department?s Office of Thrift Supervision (which later merged into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) ordered the bank to work with an independent monitor to address these issues. That involved requiring Mnuchin and other bank executives to write rules about how employees are supposed to work with borrowers to handle foreclosures creating a process to ensure employees? statements in court documents are accurate plus a long list of other rules to make sure employees don?t break the law. Regulators found the same problems at the nation?s largest mortgage lenders including Bank of America and Citibank and ordered them to do the same. OneWest complied with this legal order and in 2015 the Treasury Department released the bank from the monitoring agreement. Mnuchin ?  a former   partner ?  is now preparing to lead the same department that once reprimanded him for his banking practices. The Treasury Department?s findings mirror some of those found by state prosecutors in a 2013 memo leaked this week to the The Intercept which alleges that Mnuchin?s bank broke foreclosure rules and engaged in ?widespread misconduct? during the housing crisis. In the confidential memo   lawyers for the California attorney general?s office claimed that employees at OneWest Bank were manipulating home auctions failing to properly notify homeowners about foreclosure proceedings and backdating signatures possibly to speed up foreclosures. Of the 913 subpoenaed loan documents they reviewed they found that 909 were likely backdated. Barney Keller a spokesperson for Mnuchin told me in an email that the Treasury Department?s findings are ?garbage? and the leaked memo is ?meritless. ? Regarding the regulatory findings he said that ?the exact same consent order was agreed to by all 14 of the major financial institutions that were heavily involved in the mortgage industry. This order required all of the institutions to complete the independent foreclosure review which OneWest was the only bank to successfully complete. ?  While this is true it?s important to note that as a result of the review OneWest still had to pay roughly $8. 5 million in remediation to more than 10 000 customers for ?errors that resulted in financial harm. ? Keller added that Mnuchin had ?helped modify over 100 000 mortgages he did not even originate and in thousands of cases even reduced borrower principal.? Of course banks in many cases were already required to do that. Mnuchin?s investment in OneWest Bank was a profitable one. He purchased the failed   bank then known as IndyMac in March of 2009 and renamed it OneWest. The purchase came with tens of thousands of troubled mortgage loans most of which were  . These mortgages had monthly payments that ballooned during the housing crisis and led many homeowners to default. When prosecutors sent the confidential memo detailing their allegations to California?s   General Kamala Harris in 2013 OneWest had foreclosed on 35 000 homes in the state and was in the process of foreclosing on another 45 000. The results of the state?s investigation match many of those highlighted by the Treasury Department?s regulators though California?s prosecutors went a step further by alleging that the bank was breaking the law specifically the state?s Unfair Competition Law. In their memo prosecutors for the state urged Harris the attorney general to sue the bank for unfair business practices but she declined to take on the case according to The Intercept. A review of federal court records shows that more than 800 lawsuits were filed against OneWest while Mnuchin owned the bank. About a third of those lawsuits came from homeowners who claimed that the bank improperly foreclosed on their properties. A recurring complaint was that the bank didn?t give owners a chance to modify their loans to avoid losing their homes something the federal government required the banks to do. In a $5 million   lawsuit filed in 2012 more than 100 homeowners sued OneWest Bank for refusing to modify their loans even though they met all the program?s requirements under the law they claimed. They also accused bank staff of encouraging them to default on their mortgage payments to qualify for the   program and telling them that the bank was missing documents that homeowners said they had already sent. ?Because of OneWest?s breach [plaintiffs] have been injured including suffering negative credit consequences and some losing their homes through foreclosure sales that should have never occurred? the complaint states. The bank now under new ownership settled the case this past August for an undisclosed amount. Other cases against the bank were dismissed or settled and several remain open. In 2015 Mnuchin sold the bank which Bloomberg estimates earned him $380 million in personal profit. It was a lucrative investment that now poses a huge hurdle for him during the confirmation process to become Treasury Secretary. Senator Ron Wyden the lead Democrat on the committee that will hold his confirmation hearings told The Wall Street Journal last month that Mnuchin has a ?history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending. ? But while the hearings might become heated if Mnuchin has enough support from Republicans in the end that heat won?t really matter.
485,73332,Kids Aren?t Interested in Moral Conflict,Atlantic,Christina Starmans,1/6/2017,2017,1,,When was the last time you were tempted even briefly to do something a little immoral? To lie betray a friend?s confidence cut in line or take a little more than your share? I?m willing to bet it was today. Maybe in the past hour. Larger temptations hound us too especially those involving sex or money. And yet perhaps to a shocking extent we often rise above these temptations and act morally nonetheless. But how does the inner struggle with temptation affect how our actions are viewed by others? Who is the better person: the one who acts morally while tempted or the one who is never tempted at all? There are two strands of moral philosophy that loosely speaking make opposite predictions about which kinds of actions will be seen as most moral. One argument associated with Aristotle is that a truly moral person will wholeheartedly want to do the right thing and no part of her will be tempted to act immorally. Another argument associated with Immanuel Kant is that an action is truly moral only if it is not something you want to do ?  otherwise a person is just acting on her own desires and although the result might be positive it should not be considered especially moral. These philosophers are arguing about which actions we should see as most moral. But which of these views best captures how ordinary people actually do reason about morality? To answer the question and uncover how people reason about overcoming temptation across a lifespan my team recruited more than 250 children aged three to eight years and nearly 400 adults. Each participant was asked to consider several   scenarios depicting two characters who both acted morally. One story for example described two children who had each broken something of their mother?s. Both ultimately told their mother the truth about what they had done. And both children wanted to tell the truth and wanted to do the right thing. But one child was also tempted to lie to avoid punishment yet told the truth even though she found it difficult. The other child found it easy to tell the truth and wasn?t tempted to lie because she wasn?t concerned about the punishment. We then asked which of the two   was more morally praiseworthy. We found a striking developmental difference:   to    children judged that someone who does the right thing without experiencing immoral desires is morally superior to someone who does the right thing through overcoming conflicting desires ?  but adults had the opposite intuition. And these judgments showed up across a number of different immoral temptations including lying not helping a sibling and breaking a promise. They appeared whether we asked about which character should be rewarded for her actions which character was ?more good? or which character was most likely to act morally in the future. That adults favored the conflicted character was somewhat surprising because plenty of previous research has found that adults judge negative intentions and desires to be morally blameworthy. Yet here we have identified situations in which adults award more moral credit to people who have some negative desires rather than only positive desires. This may be because like Kant adults see the desire to act immorally as an essential component of what makes a truly moral act instead of an enjoyable action that happens to have a positive result. In this view it?s only when we want to be bad that we have the ability to choose good. Of course there are other kinds of immoral temptations that adults might judge just as harshly as children. For example a person who is tempted to molest a child but overcomes that temptation is unlikely to be seen as more moral than someone who was never tempted to molest a child in the first place. Uncovering the characteristics of temptations that lead to moral praise and those that lead to condemnation is something we are looking more closely at in continuing studies. Meanwhile our findings to date suggest that children start out with an Aristotelian moral psychology judging individuals who don?t struggle with moral decisions as more moral than those who do. But sometime after age eight they transition to a more Kantian framework judging the worth of moral actions according to how difficult the actions were for the actors. So what changes as we age? One possibility is that children lack firsthand experience with inner conflict. At first blush this seems odd ?  children certainly misbehave frequently and so it might seem like they must be experiencing the temptation to act immorally all the time. But it might be that kids don?t often simultaneously experience both the desire to be bad and the desire to be good and that gaining experience with this kind of personal inner struggle as they grow older helps them to value it or at least not to condemn it in others. A related factor might be a growing appreciation of willpower itself. Finally and intriguingly it might be that children inherently prefer people with a unified self. As we grow older though we come to appreciate the nuances of a more complex character that allows for both temptation and the willpower to overcome it. So the next time you find yourself guiltily experiencing immoral temptations relax. It might even earn you some extra praise from your adult friends so long as you do the right thing in the end. Your children on the other hand will be judging you quite harshly! This article appears courtesy of Aeon Magazine.

487,73334,Putin and the Populists,Atlantic,Ronald Brownstein,1/6/2017,2017,1,,Donald Trump is practically alone in mainstream American politics in his consistent praise of Vladimir Putin and insistence that the United States would benefit from warmer relations with Russia. But that inclination to view Putin more as ally than adversary places Trump squarely in line with the racially infused   movements gaining ground in both America and Europe. And that means the   friction over Russia between Trump and more traditional   thinkers like Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina points toward a much larger debate over the priorities that should drive American foreign policy. The Key to Putin?s Cyber Power Across the political spectrum mainstream   thinkers in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a threat largely because he is pushing to expand Russian influence across eastern Europe and the Middle East in ways that could destabilize the U. S.  system of alliances and global rules that has defined the international order since World War II. That concern has spiked amid a succession of provocative actions from Putin ranging from his 2014 incursion into Ukraine and brutal military campaign against   rebels in Syria to the U. S. intelligence community?s conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party email accounts to influence the 2016 American presidential election. (Trump due to receive an intelligence briefing about those conclusions on Friday has steadfastly resisted and belittled that conclusion.) But the   nationalists in both the United States and Europe view Putin as a potential ally because they are focused on a sharply contrasting set of international priorities: resisting Islamic radicalization unwinding global economic integration and fighting the secularization of Western societies. Top Trump advisers like incoming White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have expressed strikingly similar views. In that way the clashing perspectives on Putin reflect not only differences on how to relate specifically to Russia but on what goals should guide American foreign policy in the 21st century and what allies are necessary to advance those aims. On both sides of the Atlantic the push to reset with Putin reflects a desire to elevate a different set of   concerns while downplaying or even abandoning the alliances that have bound European nations more tightly to each other and to the United States for decades. One critical variable of the Trump presidency may be how far this radical shift in perspective advances in a Republican Party where most elected officials and   analysts still believe global stability depends on an   network of rules and alliances and still view Putin as an escalating threat to that order. Though the   embrace of Putin common in Europe remains confined to the GOP?s margins it appears to be establishing a beachhead under Trump noted Richard Fontaine president of the centrist Center for a New American Security and the former top   aide to McCain. ?It?s already going further than I expected it to go? Fontaine said in an interview. ?The fact that     Republicans are going out and suggesting we don?t know who hacked what [in the 2016 campaign] and the sanctions may be an overreaction is not a terribly encouraging sign. ? The major conservative nationalist and populist movements in Europe including France?s National Front Britain?s U. K. Independence Party Germany?s Alternative for Germany the Netherlands?s Party for Freedom Austria?s Freedom Party and Hungary?s Jobbik don?t completely overlap in their views of Putin. Geert Wilders the leader of the Party for Freedom for instance has been cooler toward Putin than the National Front?s Marine Le Pen who borrowed from a Russian bank to help fund the party?s 2014 electoral campaign or the Freedom Party which recently signed a ?cooperation agreement? with Putin?s United Russia party. But the European populist parties share a common set of priorities focused on restricting immigration unwinding global economic and political integration (by renouncing the European Union and for some of these parties NATO as well) taking tougher steps to fight Islamic radicalism and in most cases opposing cultural liberalism and secularization at home. On all those fronts they view Putin not as a threat but as an ally. ?It?s certainly not that they follow him the way Communist parties used to follow the Soviet Union. That?s a misrepresentation? said Cas Mudde a University of Georgia associate professor of international affairs who studies these movements. ?But   ?     they do like his strength what they perceive as defense for strong traditional values nationalism and opposition to Islam. ? On each of those concerns Putin has positioned himself as a bulwark of conservative values. First in Chechnya and more recently in Syria he can claim to have taken the fight to Islamic extremists perhaps more aggressively than any Western nation since America overthrew the Taliban in Afghanistan (of course Russia?s Syria campaign has focused far less on combating the Islamic State than on obliterating opponents of President Bashar  ?s regime). Conservative populists like Le Pen have hailed Putin?s hostility toward global institutions as a model for prioritizing nationalist independence over multilateral cooperation and integration. ?The model that is defended by Vladimir Putin is radically different to that of Mr. Obama? Le Pen told a British television interviewer last November. ?As for me the model that is defended by Vladimir Putin which is one of reasoned protectionism looking after the interests of his own country defending his identity is one that I like as long as I can defend this model in my own country. ? Particularly since his return to the Russian presidency in 2012 Putin has portrayed himself as a defender of traditional social values especially in opposition to gay rights and as a religiously devout alternative to Western countries that he has said ?are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national cultural religious and even sexual. ? While the idea of Putin lecturing the world on ?moral principles? grates on mainstream ears that stance has also drawn praise not only from conservative populists in Europe but also   American activists like columnist Patrick J. Buchanan whose 1996 bid for the GOP presidential nomination presaged many of Trump?s insular themes. Against these shared priorities the European populist parties almost universally downplay Putin?s destabilizing moves including those in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea as at most a   concern. Nigel Farage a founder of the U. K. Independence Party and the European populist leader personally closest to Trump has said that while Putin?s incursion in Ukraine was not justified it was an understandable response to Western overreach. ?The Ukrainian crisis actually was sparked by the European Union saying they wanted to extend their borders to take in the Ukraine which Putin took as being a direct threat? Farage told Fox News last summer. ?Now my view on Putin and the Russians is don?t poke the Russian bear with a stick. If you do you?re bound to get a response. ? Farage?s take is common among Europe?s conservative populists. ?They don?t think that Russia wants to reinstate a Soviet Union. They consider Russia pretty much defending itself against globalism and they would like to have the EU or NATO out of central and eastern Europe? Mudde said. ?But they don?t assume that Russia then moves back in. Russia is of no concern to them. They don?t believe Russia has ambitions to threaten western Europe. ? To a striking extent top Trump advisers Flynn and especially Bannon have expressed similar views in recent years. In an extensive 2014 speech at the Vatican unearthed by Buzzfeed Bannon echoed common arguments from the European nationalist parties to explain why people he called ?traditionalists? were drawn to Putin. Bannon portrayed Putin as championing both nationalism and conservative cultural values. ?One of the reasons [Putin is attractive to ?traditionalists?] is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions and he?s trying to do it in a form of nationalism ?  and I think that people particularly in certain countries want to see the sovereignty for their country they want to see nationalism for their country? Bannon said. ?They don?t believe in this kind of   Union or they don?t believe in the centralized government in the United States. ? Later Bannon added: ?Putin?s been quite an interesting character. He?s also very very very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he?s playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional values. ? To a greater extent than the European populists Bannon was careful to also criticize the Russian leader saying ?Putin and his cronies [are] a kleptocracy that are really an imperialist power that want to expand. ? But like Europe?s   populists Bannon immediately argued that the potential threat Putin posed ranked below more pressing concerns like allying with the Russian leader against Islamic terrorism. ?I really believe that in this current environment where you?re facing a potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation ?   I?m not saying we can put it on a back burner ?  but I think we have to deal with first things first. ? Flynn former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency similarly suggested sublimating American concerns about Russian behavior to the struggle against Islamic terror during his controversial visit to Moscow in December 2015. ?I am speaking as [a] private citizen but the U. S. can?t sit there and go: ?Russia you?re bad? Russia can?t sit there and be ?U. S. you?re bad! ?? Flynn said in an interview on RT Russia?s     television network. ?I think that we have to step back and we have to say: ?Okay what are the common interests and what are the common goals that we want to achieve? ?  and   ?     I believe the number one goal is to eliminate this cancerous idea that exists inside the Islamic religion. ? Expanding the argument Flynn suggested that the new threat of global terror required a fundamental shift in priorities that would position the United States and Russia less as competitors than as collaborators in a common fight. ?[W]e have to begin to understand that this is not an   world folks [that it?s] actually more of a   world and we have to decide ?  U. S. Europe Russia and other other countries countries in South America maybe and even China and India how do we want the world to be over the course of the next 10 years 25 years 50 years?? Flynn added. ?[I] don?t believe for a second that we?re going to defeat the Islamic State in two years. This has been described as a   War. ? How many of these views Trump personally shares is unclear. He has said strikingly little about why he believes better relations with Putin would advantage the United States other than to broadly suggest the two nations could work together more effectively against ISIS. Many analysts see Trump?s attraction to Putin as mostly a personal connection driven both by Trump?s admiration for his   style and Putin?s careful flattery of the  . But Fontaine the former McCain aide and CNAS president said a tilt toward Putin would be compatible with two larger   tendencies Trump has hinted at. One is an inclination to view ?China as the bigger threat? to the United States both because of its aggressive posture in Asia and because it represents a much more formidable economic competitor than Russia. Second Fontaine noted Trump at various points has suggested ?  particularly in his comments about Asia ?  that he is more comfortable trying to maintain global stability through regional ?spheres of influence? led by locally dominant powers than through ?one unified world order in which American power is the ultimate foundation. ? Through that lens Fontaine continued Russia?s attempts to expand its reach in eastern Europe ?may not be as concerning to you than if you are concerned that it is undermining the   system of the world. ? So far Fontaine said this more benign assessment of Putin has very little support among elected officials in either party. ?Almost everybody thinks if we can find some way to work with Russia on discrete issues [then] sure [let?s pursue those opportunities]? he said. ?But that there is no overarching deal or friendly bond between the U. S. and this Russia that can be had either without compromising fundamental interests or principles or seeing the agreement go up in smoke when Russia violates it. ? McCain offered the rallying cry for that competing view in his bristling opening statement at Thursday?s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Russian hacking and other cyber threats. ?It should not surprise us that Vladimir Putin would think he could launch increasingly severe cyberattacks against our nation? McCain insisted ?when he has paid little price for invading Ukraine annexing Crimea subverting democratic values and institutions across Europe and of course helping Bashar [ ]Assad slaughter civilians in Syria for more than a year with impunity. ? And yet both in America and in Europe electoral momentum has been growing for the   and populist movements arguing for a fundamental reassessment of global alliances that would include a reset of relations with Russia. The depth of Putin?s commitments to these movements is likely shallow: As Mudde noted Russia has touted   parties in Europe as well when that suits its interests. But Putin has also clearly demonstrated that he views the rise of conservative nationalism as an ally of convenience in a goal that suddenly seems more obtainable than at any time in decades: loosening the Western alliance from both its American and European moorings. ?I don?t think we should underestimate the degree to which the undermining of the fabric of Western society is a fundamental aim of what Putin is all about? said Ivo Daalder President Obama?s former permanent representative to NATO and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ?We are in a very different time period that has far more to do with the 1920s and 1930s than it does with 2010. We are at a tipping point where the success of these [populist] movements raises fundamental question about the [viability of the] international order we are living in. ?

488,73335,What Donald Trump Owes Wall Street,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,1/6/2017,2017,1,,Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump according to an investigation just published by the Wall Street Journal. While the  ?s finances remain murky due largely to his refusal to release his tax returns the newspaper reports that he owes at least hundreds of millions of dollars that the debt is held by more than 150 institutions and that some of it is backed by his personal guarantee. ?As a result a broader array of financial institutions now are in a potentially powerful position over the incoming president? it states. ?If the Trump businesses were to default on their debts the giant financial institutions that serve as   special servicers of these loan pools would have the power to foreclose on some of Mr. Trump?s marquee properties or seek the tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump personally guaranteed on the loans. ? One wonders whether to be more worried about Big Finance using its leverage to influence the president or the president abusing his power in order to thwart his creditors. Either way Trump?s decision to hold on to his opaque business empire while president rather than liquidating his interests to focus on the good of the country has created unprecedented conflicts of interest that even a saint would have difficulty navigating in office. In a prior column I noted a New York Times investigation into a portion of Trump?s business dealings in foreign countries arguing that in India China Turkey Saudi Arabia Indonesia Brazil Argentina and other countries besides there will be countless occasions where the interests of the United States and the interests of the Trump organization diverge. If the Times story was the best look we?ve gotten at specific conflicts of interest abroad the Wall Street Journal article is the domestic analog highlighting facts like this: Wells Fargo  Co. for example runs at least five mutual funds that own portions of Trump businesses? securitized debt according to an analysis of   data conducted by Morningstar Inc. for the Journal. The bank also is a trustee or administrator for pools of securitized loans that include $282 million of loans to Mr. Trump. And Wells acts as a special servicer for $950 million of loans to a property that one of Mr. Trump?s companies partly owns according to securities and property filings. Wells Fargo is currently facing scrutiny from federal regulators surrounding its fraudulent sales practices and other issues. Once he takes office Mr. Trump will appoint the heads of many of the regulators that police the bank. The article lists other specific conflicts. And then there?s this alarming detail: ?It is impossible to identify all the firms or individuals that now hold Trump businesses? securitized debt as these investments often don?t have to be disclosed. ? As a result it is easy to imagine Trump covertly benefitting or punishing one of his debtors (depending on his analysis of what?s preferable). He needn?t be in a position to directly appoint regulators to do so. He often posts tweets that laud or vilify corporations with huge consequences for their stockholders. How many corporate leaders would quietly forgive debt if the stock of their biggest competitor would be tanked rather than their own? This should concern even Americans who voted for Donald Trump. The underlying case here isn?t that he is unusually corrupt but that the extreme power of the presidency requires a responsible country to put anyone who rises to the position under a microscope. Trump?s unusually big business conflicts create even more problems than usual temptations to which the vast majority of humans might succumb. If Trump merely behaves as most people would the country will lose bigly. Tens of millions of people will be harmed. Trump is nevertheless offering less transparency than any predecessor in the modern era and entering office with both houses of Congress controlled by Republicans who show no inclination to fulfill their responsibility to scrutinize his conflicts. Until members of Congress launch a full probe into Trump?s financial assets and debts so that at the very least they can understand where his interests and America?s interests diverge there is no way that they can adequately represent their constituents. And it is particularly ironic that their historic abdication of responsibility is rooted in partisanship given that it will benefit a man with no loyalty to the Republican Party.
489,73336,The Desire to Live-Stream Violence,Atlantic,J. Weston Phippen,1/6/2017,2017,1,,   Two men and two women in Chicago were arrested and charged Thursday with kidnapping and torturing a man slicing off a piece of his hair down to his scalp with a knife. Many people were witness to the assault because it was streamed on Facebook Live. Jordan Hill Tesfaye Cooper Brittany Covington all 18 and Tanishia Covington who is 24 (police had earlier said she was 18 as well) have each been charged with felony aggravated kidnapping unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. And because the suspects are all black the victim white and because video of the assault shows the suspects yelling ?fuck Donald Trump? and ?fuck white people? the four have also been charged with a hate crime. Police said one of the suspects knew the victim who is 18 from high school. The victim had been reported missing Monday by his family and is said to have   problems. He was taken in a stolen van from where his family had dropped him off to meet a friend how he ended up with the suspects is still being investigated. In the video the man sits in the corner of the room bound and with tape over his mouth. The suspects cut the sleeves of his sweatshirt kick and hit him and threaten his life. It?s a crime Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson called ?sickening. ? He said it displayed the ?brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see. ? Which raises the question: Why would someone   a crime? ?There?s an easy answer? N. G. Berrill executive director of the the New York Center for Neuropsychology  Forensic Behavioral Science told me ?which is that they?re stupid. ? Most of the approximately   video focuses on a woman who is apparently holding a cellphone and filming the assault. She blows smoke into the camera flashes a few bottles of alcohol even checks her hair. The three others in the   pop in and out and talk to the camera. At one point dissatisfied with how few people have tuned in to watch the group assault the man the woman with the cellphone says to her internet following ?You all ain?t even commenting on my shit. Ain?t nobody watching my shit. ? A bit later presumably after someone commented on her   she says ?What up Devin? ?During all this the bound victim can be heard pleading  . Stupidity may be one answer for the suspects? actions. But the group also seems oblivious of their actions and callous to the victim?s suffering. Berrill said part of the reason they might have   the assault can be chalked up to teen impulsiveness. ?Obviously there?s not a lot of   thought here? he said. The more difficult answer however cuts close to a recent internet phenomenon that includes cases like Marina Lonina the Ohio woman who filmed her underage friend being raped last year on Periscope another   application. Lonina and her friend who was 17 went home with    Raymond Boyd Gates who was convicted last October of rape. Lonina told police later she intended to recorded the assault so Gates would stop but in the words of the prosecutor ?she got caught up in it by the number of likes that her   was getting so she continued to do it.? Violence will always attract attention. And in the Chicago video clip the four teenagers boast about their intentions to harm the man almost feeding and building upon each other?s claims until one man tells viewers they plan to stick the victim in the trunk of a car put a brick on the gas pedal then let it ?errrrrrrr   ?     . ? ?It speaks to a kind of scary place in the culture where people are willing to expose their misled ideas their sadism their sexual perversion their felonious behavior for the accolades they?ll receive through social media? Berrill said. Police would later find the victim disoriented wandering the streets on Chicago?s West Side an area that experienced heavy violence this past year as has much of the city. This context is also important in understanding what happened: Last year the city had 762 homicides a nearly 60 percent increase from the previous year. In certain neighborhoods violence is normal. Young kids especially teenagers can become desensitized to what may seem to the rest of the country as merely one horrific moment. ?It is a perfect example of chaos? Desmond Patton an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University and who studied at the University of Chicago told me. ?Number one they are young people and young people have forever made dumb decisions and mistakes. But when this is embedded in an environment of violence where violence is unaddressed and in deprived communities then these are the types of things that can happen. ? The world in which some of the young men and women live can be horrifying Patton said and the   is partly a reflection of that. What may seem appalling and evil to the wider world may not be too far beyond normal for some of these people ?  it?s just not typically broadcast for everyone to see. Many of the people Berrill studies in cases like this are   or   and like a child repeatedly dropping a toy on the ground they have trouble differentiating good and bad attention. This will probably get worse Berrill said. Facebook?s   application is relatively new. It has been used to record the mundane the exceptionally heroic the horrific and in this case the sadistic. In that way it is a reflection of society. But what?s new Berrill said is he wonders if this attack would have even happened if the assailants could not have broadcast it. ?It?s an element in these cases that encourages this behavior because they know immediately there?s a built in audience for it? he said. As people develop online communities and audiences there will always be a desire to attract more attention ?  whether that?s through Twitter or  . And a shortcut to attract attention will always be to say or do something absurd contentious even violent.
490,73337,Is NASA Paving the Way for Asteroid Mining?,Atlantic,Marina Koren,1/6/2017,2017,1,,In March 1852 Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis discovered an asteroid orbiting between Mars and Jupiter one of several he would find in his lifetime. He named it Psyche after the Greek word for the soul. Many decades later the name would take on new meaning. Scientists believe Psyche one of the largest objects in the asteroid belt may be the exposed metal core of an early planet the soul of a celestial body. Seven years from now we?ll find out for sure. Earlier this week NASA chose to fund an eponymous robotic mission to Psyche scheduled to launch in 2023. The mission marks the first time spacecraft will visit a metallic asteroid an extremely rare object in the solar system. Similar NASA missions have only visited rocky and icy worlds like planets and other asteroids like Vesta and Ceres. Scientists believe Psyche could have grown to be the size of Mars but its rocky outer layers were smashed away by a series of collisions billions of years ago. What remains a world made of metallic nickel and iron is about the size of Massachusetts. ?By visiting Psyche we can literally visit a planetary core the only way that humankind ever can? Lindy   the Psyche mission?s lead investigator told reporters Wednesday. ?It?s 1 800 miles to the Earth?s core and the deepest humans have ever managed to drill is     miles. ? Psyche is the only known round metal body in the solar system. The Psyche mission led by researchers from Arizona State University will launch in 2023 and reach its namesake by 2030. Over 20 months the spacecraft will collect data about Psyche?s composition and topography and as is standard for robotic missions these days return beautiful   images of the asteroid. They hope Psyche will help them better understand planet formation and learn more about Earth?s own iron core. The Psyche mission is part of NASA?s Discovery program which funds robotic spacecraft usually focused on a specific slice of science. The missions are capped at $450 million making them pretty inexpensive as far as solar system trips go. But the payoffs can be big. The Kepler space telescope has discovered hundreds of exoplanets since its launch in 2009 MESSENGER mission put the first spacecraft into Mercury?s orbit in 2011 and Dawn orbited one asteroid in 2011 before zooming over toward another last year helping scientists understand the formation of rocky and icy bodies. The Discovery announcement suggests a growing enthusiasm for asteroid research. NASA has also approved funding for the Lucy mission which will launch in 2021 to explore the Trojan asteroids so called because they?re named after figures in the mythical war that share the orbit Jupiter takes around the sun. The choices add to a potentially   news cycle for the 2020s. NASA this week announced it would fund for another year the Near Earth Object Camera project which would launch an infrared telescope into space track potentially dangerous asteroids near Earth in 2021. The space agency is also working on the Asteroid Redirect Mission an ambitious plan to redirect an asteroid into a stable orbit around the moon where astronauts will visit it and come back with samples in the 2020s. But this mission is perhaps the unluckiest of them all. The project is costing NASA more than $1 billion and has found little to tepid support within the scientific and lawmaking community ?  and the next administration. Looking beyond the 2020s NASA?s asteroid kick is especially exciting for supporters of asteroid mining. The development of such technology is still very much in its infancy but it?s underway. Planetary Resources a    startup based in Washington State has been collecting investors for an   satellite with plans to someday mine the objects. Last summer the government of Luxembourg announced it would create a fund of more than $227 million for investment in   companies. Planetary Resources received  nearly $27 million of that in November. Little is known about the composition and other properties of the Trojan asteroids near Jupiter. But the resources on   Psyche could be worth billions or even trillions of dollars ?  once humans finish developing the technology to mine them of course.
491,73338,Can States Make People Pay Even When Their Convictions Are Overturned?,Atlantic,Garrett Epps,1/6/2017,2017,1,,A decade or so ago I asked students in an     seminar to write an essay on the following topic: Can we as lawyers live ?good lives? (in the philosophical sense) when we earn our daily bread from a system devoted to controlling confining punishing and even killing others with scant regard for their individuality or even their guilt or innocence? The answer my students uniformly gave was yes. The system they said was livable because ?we do our best? with limited funds and in the face of intractable social problems. The system sometimes fails they said but it strives for justice. Trump vs. the Spies What?s interesting is that most of my students had by that time in their studies seen enough to know that answer is often not true. In their daily practice lawyers continually recognize and often exploit the ways in which the legal system works  against the poor and the outsider to the advantage of the rich and powerful. In the system?s    workings justice is not a goal of which the system falls short it is by and large an irrelevance. Yet in their hearts many Americans lawyer and   alike cling to the shining myth: Runnymede Sir Thomas More Atticus Finch Gideon v. Wainwright Archibald Cox. But every now and then like a hologram in a   TV show the myth flickers and fades revealing ugly truth below the myth: an organized racket by which those on top corral and shear the sheep on the bottom depriving them of liberty property and even life after a mockery of due process and by criteria so arbitrary as to be indistinguishable from whim. Consider the case the Supreme Court will hear Monday. Nelson v. Colorado poses the following question: Suppose you are arrested charged with a serious crime and convicted. The court sentences you to prison and orders you to pay various fees and restitution ?  seemingly small amounts that are given your economic circumstances daunting nonetheless. Then against the odds you persuade a higher court that the evidence against you was insufficient or improperly admitted. Your conviction is overturned. You are free to go. Can the state keep the money it seized from you on the grounds that you?re probably guilty anyway? That in essence is the claim advanced by the state of Colorado in defense of its uniquely punitive system of criminal fines and fees. Most states have increasingly turned to forcing criminal defendants to pay the costs of their own prosecution. But only Colorado has decided it can keep defendants? money even when their convictions are set aside. The petitioners in the case are Shannon Nelson and Louis Alonzo Madden. Nelson was convicted of five counts of sexual abuse allegedly directed at her children. A state appeals court reversed her conviction however it said that the trial judge had allowed improper ?expert? testimony that tainted the jury?s verdict. After the appeal the state brought Nelson to trial again. That time a jury acquitted her of all charges. Madden was convicted of attempting to patronize a child prostitute and attempted sexual assault. On appeal a state court set aside the   conviction and affirmed the assault count then a state trial judge decided that Madden?s lawyer had been ineffective and therefore vacated the assault conviction as well. The state chose not to try Madden again. Both defendants had paid a fee to the state crime victim compensation fund a ?docket fee? a ?time payment fee? a   fee and other fees as well as restitution payments to the victims of the crimes. After their cases ended each asked for repayment of the sums they had paid. Madden got back his fees but the court refused to repay the restitution. A different trial court told Nelson she was entitled to  nothing. A state appeals court ordered the money repaid but the Colorado Supreme Court reversed that decision. Though many other state? laws permit courts to order similar refunds as a kind of inherent judicial power the Colorado court decided that the two could only obtain repayment under the terms of a 2013 statute called the Colorado ?Exoneration Act. ? That statute was plainly designed to pay money to anyone wrongly convicted of crime and held for years in prison. If such a person can produce ?clear and convincing evidence? that he or she was innocent then the court can award a hefty payment ?  as much as $120 000 a year in capital cases ?  for each year wrongly served. That money is not repayment it is an independent payment for the wrong done to the convicted person. But of course Nelson and Madden weren?t seeking payment and more important they hadn?t proved they were ?innocent. ? They hadn?t tried to they aren?t required to under the American system. (Runnymede Finch Gideon ?  remember? ). The state always has the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and this it had in both cases been unable to do. Nonetheless the state supreme court held the state was entitled to the money. It?s hard to see why if you go by you know the law and the Constitution ?  there is no legal crime for which either owed fines or restitution. Nonetheless the court said Nelson and Madden were out of luck unless they could prove their innocence. Nelson and Madden have one fairly compelling argument as pithily phrased in their petition: ?It is not Colorado?s money. ? That ought to appeal to the Court coupled with the fact that the Colorado system seems to be unique. Most states charge the ?fees? and order restitution but readily refund the payments if a conviction is found invalid. Colorado?s brief to the Supreme Court is so truculent so full of Margaret   faux outrage that a reader might suspect the state has no case. In their first argument the state?s lawyers rewrite the petitioners? claim suggesting they are grifters trying to create out of thin air a   right to an ?automatic money judgment? when convictions are set aside. This is too clever by half. The petitioners aren?t seeking a payment as compensation for being convicted they just want their own money back. The state?s second argument rewrites the existing law. The brief cites venerable cases suggesting that defendants don?t necessarily get repayment of fines even after a court strikes down the statute they were convicted under. Those cases however might be called ?Inigo Montoya cases? ?  that is they do not mean what Colorado thinks they mean. In most of them the defendants had either (1) admitted guilt or (2) voluntarily chosen to pay a fine and plead guilty in order to avoid jail. Neither of those is true in this case the defendants have consistently pleaded not guilty and neither agreed to the ?fees? and restitution or received any leniency for paying them. The fees and restitution were part of a criminal sentence. In fact Colorado?s main argument seems to be written between the lines. May it please the Court their brief whispers these two may have escaped justice on a technicality but we all know they are guilty as hell. In its recital of the facts the state lingers over each stage of the proceedings ?  these sure were bad crimes weren?t they? The trial court found probable cause didn?t it? There were ?forensic interviews? weren?t there? The victims testified didn?t they? A jury convicted them didn?t it? Come on it seems to be saying. We all know that if these people are so   pure the police would never have arrested them. It?s thoroughly unappealing advocacy and one hopes it will not sway four of the eight (if the Court deadlocks the Colorado state court decision will stand). As I said above Colorado is the only state with the gall to demand money from defendants whose convictions are reversed. The Court can easily reverse this grotesque decision without disruption of the system nationwide ?  and we can all go back to our shining dream of justice.
492,73339,America Is Still Making Things  ,Atlantic,Alana Semuels,1/6/2017,2017,1,,COLUMBIA CITY Ind. ?  Big companies such as Rexnord and Carrier are closing down plants in this Rust Belt state and moving their factories to Mexico. But in some corners including this rural patch of the state?s northeast manufacturing is growing. In a nondescript building set among the icy cornfields of Columbia City Brian Emerick the CEO and owner of Micropulse employs 306 people who make millions of dollars worth of specialized medical equipment such as orthopedic implants and the surgical tools used to install them. That?s up from the 190 he employed five years ago. ?I?m bullish on manufacturing here? he told me as he walked me through the    facility where workers were busy running machines and inspecting tiny metal parts with giant magnifying glasses. ?There?s always going to be a certain amount of jobs you can?t automate away. ? Micropulse is an example of the type of manufacturing that?s not going to disappear anytime soon from United States. It makes   products that would be difficult to make overseas because they are constantly being updated and are highly regulated. Many of these products are made by machines but Emerick still needs workers to run and program those machines and to inspect the products once they?re completed. As some types of manufacturing disappear in America ?  manual jobs that can be performed in  places like Mexico where there are lower wages and repetitive ones that can be automated ?  other types are growing.   advanced manufacturing which is highly specialized and requires a facility with computers is actually expanding. The U. S. economy will need to fill 3. 5 million skilled manufacturing jobs over the next decade the White House says. This is an industry that employs skilled and educated workers such as engineers and scientists. It?s also an industry that adds significant value to the economy. Manufacturing output continues to rise in the U. S. and the average factory worker makes $180 000 worth of goods every year more than three times what he produced in 1978. ?The mantra that we?ve lost   jobs to China is exactly wrong? said Michael Hicks an economics professor at Ball State University who has studied manufacturing in Indiana. ?We?ve lost the   jobs to China and gained   jobs. ? Of course the U. S. has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000 and those losses have reverberated across the country. The scale of those losses has overshadowed areas of growth ?  but there has been growth. For example the number of workers employed manufacturing medical equipment and supplies has grown eight percent over the last two decades according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics even as overall manufacturing employment has fallen 28 percent over that same time period. Indeed manufacturing job losses have been concentrated in     jobs said Hicks. Since 2000 jobs in manufacturing for people with graduate degrees have grown by 32 percent. While manufacturing jobs for people with less than a   education fell 44 percent between 2000 and 2013 those for people with an associate degrees in academic fields rose 17 percent according to the Congressional Research Service. That?s because in the last decade as manufacturing companies faced intense competition from overseas they invested in equipment and technology that made their plants more efficient and specialized Hicks said. That meant that thousands of jobs were automated but also that new jobs were created for people who worked with machines in the manufacturing process. This increased specialization is exactly what economic theory predicts would happen as trade advances Hicks said. A concept known as comparative advantage suggests that countries should use their assets to specialize ?  to make what they make best. Because of comparatively low costs of labor in countries such as China and Mexico those countries specialize in making the kinds of goods that require a lot of labor but not as much technology and skill. For the United States the result is the opposite: Its advantage is the kind of     manufacturing that capitalizes on the country?s technology and educated labor pool. ?Our comparative advantage would be towards more sophisticated production? Hicks said. This is a key point often missed in the debate over whether it?s trade or automation that has displaced American jobs. Automation and trade are deeply entwined phenomena trade increases pressures to automate or export simple jobs but also incentivizes the U. S. to specialize and create more   jobs. In some ways the whole narrative that manufacturing is disappearing is flawed Hicks says. Manufacturing like most other industries in America has modernized and become more sophisticated over the decades. To be sure it employs millions fewer people than it did in the past. But manufacturing still makes up about 12. 5 percent of America?s gross domestic product the same as it did in 1960. People who can work in modern manufacturing ?  those with computer skills and advanced degrees ?  are in demand. The average manufacturing worker now makes $26 an hour according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The catch is that traditional manufacturing workers don?t have those advanced degrees and can?t get those jobs. ?Maybe the problem isn?t so much the industry job losses but that the men and women in manufacturing had much poorer educational attainment and had been in less technically dynamic workplaces Hicks told me. ? So when the world changed they could not. ? Half a century ago almost no manufacturing workers went to college they graduated from high school and went straight to the factory where they could find a good job for life. Now it?s becoming more and more common for manufacturers to hire workers who have some higher education. Nearly 20 percent of the manufacturing workforce had a bachelor?s degree in 2012 up from 16 percent in 2000. Just 10 percent had less than a   education down from 14 percent in 2000. Nearly 9 percent of the manufacturing workforce has a graduate or professional degree.    Advanced manufacturing presents a glimmer of hope for Rust Belt states such as Indiana which lost huge numbers of jobs over the last two decades creating a class of people with few prospects. Manufacturing employment in Indiana fell by 35 percent from 671 000 in 2000 to 439 000 in 2010. Yet Indiana has the highest share of advanced manufacturing in the country according to a study from Ball State University with 53 percent of manufacturing jobs in the state in advanced manufacturing. There are now 516 200 people working in manufacturing in Indiana. Examples of advanced manufacturers in Indiana include Rolls Royce which makes jet engines and employs thousands of engineers in Indianapolis Cook Medical which makes medical devices in an old RCA television plant in Bloomington and Zimmer Biomet which makes surgical products in Warsaw Indiana which is a national hub for orthopedic devices. ?In a   environment like Indiana competing on lowest cost is simply not going to be effective? Mohan Tatikonda a professor at Indiana University?s Kelley School of Business told me. ?What can be done in   environments is making products that are more innovative more customized to customer requirements. ? Emerick says there are a few reasons why his clients which are orthopedic   companies choose to have their products made in Indiana by Micropulse rather than overseas. In order to finalize the devices? design there?s a lot of communication back and forth between the companies and Emerick?s engineers. Doing such discussion in multiple languages and over a   time difference would be challenging he said. What?s more since the devices are used in surgery or inserted into patients? bodies they are subject to a high degree of regulation. Micropulse has frequent inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies and such inspections would be difficult to conduct overseas. ?We?re not known for low prices but we provide the highest value in terms of reliability and ease of doing business? Emerick said. ?Our products are low volume but they?re pretty tough to make and the materials have to be certified and traceable. ? I also stopped by an Indianapolis manufacturing facility operated by the pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly where the company makes pills capsules and devices such as injection pens for insulin users. The factory is highly automated ?  I saw few people as Darin Moody Eli Lilly?s senior vice president for global dry product and API manufacturing gave me a tour. Moody showed me a   unit which is essentially a series of highly automated machines that can make pharmaceuticals around the clock assessing ingredient volumes and production independently. Yet even continuous manufacturing needs some human input: There was a group of workers in what?s called the control room where technicians were preparing programs on computers to run a test of a placebo. ?One of the things we?ve learned is that the more complex and the more automated your facilities are the more dependent you are on having people who understand how those very complex facilities operate? Moody said. Though some of the workers in the control room had just a   degree most had more education such as a bachelor?s degree in chemistry. One of the reasons Lilly has kept so much manufacturing in Indiana is because the company has close relationships with local colleges and universities who serve as a pipeline for these educated workers. About half of the 3 000 workers at the Indianapolis facility have bachelor?s degrees or higher. ?We?re heavily dependent on engineers and scientists? Moody said. And as I?ve written before people who work in manufacturing and lose their jobs to trade or automation often don?t seek retraining even though there are resources available to them. Timothy Slaper the director of economic analysis at Indiana University?s Business Research Center studied what happened to nearly 200 000 people making transportation equipment and primary metals in Indiana between 2003 and 2014. He found that while over that time period   of the workers were still in their respective manufacturing industries 44 percent had no payroll record at all by 2014. Only about 3 percent of these workers graduated from a public college or university in Indiana during that time period. ?Very few went back to school and relatively few seemed to avail themselves of a lot of the government programs available? Slaper told me. Still a new generation of workers may be more likely to seek out the education required for these advanced manufacturing jobs. Cole Love 22 loves working with his hands and wanted to work in manufacturing after seeing his father?s job at an orthopedic company. Love who has a   degree in   technology recently started working a Micropulse where he operates a Swiss lathe making instruments that doctors use in surgery. Though Love only makes $14 an hour now he is planning to go back to school and get a bachelor?s degree so he can work his way up at Micropulse. ?I figure there?s always going to be people to program and set up the machines? he said. The companies that employ people like Love are going to have to keep changing too. Manufacturers who aren?t constantly innovating and doing things that their overseas competitors can?t will be left behind. Emerick for instance started the company out of his garage in 1988 it was a    company making instruments for all sorts of industries. But in the late 1990s and early 2000s many of his customers including United Technologies the parent company of Carrier moved operations overseas and he lost business. The company was barely surviving when Emerick decided to auction off equipment and specialize in making tools and parts for medical companies. Micropulse now generates $40 million in sales annually. ?The key is focus? he said. ?It?s about getting good at what you do then doing more of it so you?re recognized by your customers as being the expert. ? Specialization worked at Micropulse and it could work too for others who want to continue to be employed in manufacturing. Unskilled jobs in the industry have been disappearing for decades as technology and globalization have made them obsolete. Yet technology is also enabling new types of jobs that provide a career for people who know how to use it. The hard part is what happens to everyone else. 
493,73340,The Value of Fighting Attacks on Free Speech Early and Often,Atlantic,Conor Friedersdorf,1/6/2017,2017,1,,Professor Keith Humphreys of Stanford University does not believe that speech is threatened on America?s campuses. He?s never perceived a meaningful threat himself. And he is very antagonistic toward several of us who believe that important values and vulnerable people will suffer unless more is done to protect free expression. His posture is not unusual. Across issues and ideologies on matters big and small harms that disproportionately affect a vulnerable group or class of people attract skeptics who feel impelled to minimize the importance of documented injustices especially when they manifest in what appear to be atypical circumstances. A skeptic may grant that there are bad apples in police departments hate crimes perpetrated against Muslims abusive teachers who exploit union job protections or men who catcall women on the street. But perhaps they?ve never been affected or known anyone who has suffered the relevant harm so they are predisposed to concluding that the problem isn?t really that bad. Baffled by those who think otherwise they come to regard them as discreditable agitators. This type of skeptic is a scourge of civil libertarians. Though they may value the same goods in the abstract they have a bankrupt understanding of how civil rights liberties and key norms must be defended in the particular if they are to endure. Last year while reviewing the case that free speech rights and norms are threatened from the top down and the bottom up on college campuses I detailed evidence as varied as official codes of conduct that explicitly restrict speech at scores of campuses a lobbying campaign to ban some criticism of Israel at the University of California many efforts to disinvite speakers from colleges a government program that sent undercover cops to spy on Muslim college students an administrative action at UCLA that brazenly violated the First Amendment student activists at numerous institutions formally demanding that speech be punished and widespread attempts to restrict the content of college newspapers. The rundown was highly incomplete but I thought it sufficient to make the case. Humphreys was so unpersuaded by ?The Glaring Evidence That Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus? that he cited it this week in a contemptuously dismissive rebuttal posted at Reality Based Community and The Washington Monthly. He began with an anecdote. On a brisk autumn evening at Stanford University he chanced upon two acquaintances a retired Eastern European diplomat and a female graduate student. Humphreys shook hands with the diplomat who was wearing leather gloves then introduced the diplomat to the grad student. The diplomat removed his gloves to shake her hand ?  and the graduate student did not take offense that he did so. ?After he departed I said I had never seen a man take off a glove before shaking a woman?s hand and asked the student if she had or if she knew whence the custom came? Humphreys wrote. ?She smiled and responded ?I really don?t know maybe they do that where he?s from. But he?s a sweet old man and I could tell it was his way of being gallant. ?? For Humphreys that anecdote is a useful corrective. ?If you have been reading Conor Friedersdorf?s or Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt?s writings about campus culture in The Atlantic? he wrote you?d have thought that ?the women recoiled from the gendered   and lambasted the diplomat. ? But the encounter as it really unfolded represents ?what I have seen over and over again from students for decades? he wrote. ?A spirit of common humanity and a tolerance for different ways of acting and thinking. People come to my university from all countries and all backgrounds with a huge range of beliefs and customs. Yet I have never (and I do mean never) witnessed anything on campus suggesting that the atmosphere of widespread intolerance suspicion and emotional fragility that I keep reading about in The Atlantic actually exists. ? Sure he added ?some students now and then have goofy ideas or act in rude ways? but he recalls that ?being just as much the case when I was a student 30 years ago. ?(For what it?s worth free speech on campus was certainly threatened then too.) He concluded with paragraphs that treat the distinct questions of whether speech is threatened and whether today?s students are awful as though they are the same: I have asked many colleagues and students at my university and at other universities this   question ?Have you read how students today are coddled intolerant whiny   prigs and do you yourself have any experience at all of this? ?Everyone has answered yes to the first part of the question and all but a handful have answered no to the second. I thus remain dubious that the heavily recycled grab bag of anecdotes I keep hearing from Conor Friedersdorf and company establish that universities have suddenly become   of epistemic closure Maoist impulses and mattress wallpaper. Repeating dramatic anecdotes does not make them more representative of the experiences of the over 15 million students at our country?s over 4 500 colleges and universities. Humphreys did not quote any of my actual work in his article or when he queried his colleagues. Had he done so he might have realized that I think more highly of their cohort than he led readers to believe that I believe the most alarming ? ? transgressions against free speech to be the work of a small minority of students and that even when writing about the most egregiously illiberal student  behavior I include passages like this one written about events last year at Yale: The purpose of writing about their missteps now is not to condemn these students. Their young lives are tremendously impressive by any reasonable measure. They are unfortunate to live in an era in which the normal mistakes of youth are unusually visible. To keep the focus where it belongs I won?t be naming any of them here. The focus belongs on the flawed ideas that they?ve absorbed. Everyone invested in how the elites of tomorrow are being acculturated should understand as best they can how so many cognitively privileged ordinarily kind seemingly   young people could lash out with such flagrant intolerance. With regard to the overall threat to speech it is strange to be accused of trafficking only in dramatic anecdotes when my article includes an alphabetical list of institutions with written codes that infringe on speech with links to source material. Still the style of attack is too familiar to be surprising. Those who point to evidence of war crimes are often accused of hating the troops those who raise concerns about the difficulty of firing abusive or incompetent educators are accused of being     activists are invariably told that not all men are sexual predators as if it is obvious that they believe otherwise reformers calling attention to unjust police killings are cast as waging ?war on cops? but in every case as in the matter of threats to campus speech one needn?t hold any whole class in contempt to see preventable injustices or worrisome trends or to conclude that clearer thinking or better policy would be useful. Wrongheaded behavior exists in every population even the ones we like and root for. When I pushed back on Twitter Humphreys expanded on his reasons for dismissing the case I made in ?The Glaring Evidence That Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus. ? He noted that even if I cited 100 restrictive speech codes that would amount to evidence of a problem at no more than 2 percent of college campuses he observed a dearth of evidence that speech is more restricted now than in the past he said he would be persuaded only if ?a random sample? of campuses revealed speech codes that were ?stupid and being enforced? or a nationally representative survey showed ?a rising pervasive tide of firings censorship and harassment. ? Otherwise he said one is just ?sampling the fringe and presenting it as generalizable. ? He made some good points. I would welcome the data a national survey of educational institutions would yield. And it is useful to remember that there has never been a golden age of unfettered expression in institutions of higher education from Socrates on down even as taboos and orthodoxies have changed. But like most attempts to insist that documented injustices in a given realm don?t rise to a level that warrants concern his insistence on further evidence falls short. It doesn?t make much sense to wait until a civil right or settled norm is attacked so pervasively that a large portion of the population has suffered harm before defending it. I?d prefer to protect the vulnerable individuals or groups first affected ?  what Humphreys calls ?the fringe? ?   ?  and thereby preempt pervasive harm. The   rights that Americans enjoy today are ours precisely because organizations like the ACLU have spent decades ?sampling the fringe? and filing lawsuits adjudicating edge cases on behalf of the victims often precisely because they are suffering from discriminatory treatment that is atypical and unrepresentative. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education is doing that work today. It does so in part because it understands that enforcing speech restrictions against a very few people can invisibly chill the speech of a much larger class. One or two firings may be enough to convince many professors to watch what they say no faculty waits for a wholesale purge before they begin to  . And suggesting that a hundred institutions restricting free speech still wouldn?t be sufficient evidence of a broad problem ?   ?  or that a randomized sample is needed before a rigorous threshold is met ?   ?  makes no sense in this context. Sometimes the actions of a single university can have a broad impact all on their own. I?ve repeatedly written about threats to free speech at the University of California. It is funded by taxpayers overseen by elected officials and encompasses 238 000 students. Its faculty and staff number 190 000 and it has roughly 1. 7 million alumni. When the UC system infringes on free speech it has enormous ramifications even if a randomly selected sample of other colleges is doing much better. While I generally share the critique that Ivy League institutions loom too large in American life and in coverage of higher education there is also a strong case for evincing particular concern for the health of free speech at places like Harvard Yale Princeton and Brown: Their undergraduates are disproportionately propelled into positions of influence in government business and media they exert soft power and influence in academia their gargantuan endowments vest them with outsized clout and vital   and medical research is disproportionately undertaken on their campuses where the strength of   norms will affect its quality. Even if   norms at America?s   system of community colleges and its many trade schools are as healthy as they?ve ever been threats to free speech elsewhere remain important. Nor do I believe that those who care about higher education enlightenment values and liberal norms ought to evince concern about ?stupid? speech codes in college handbooks only when they are regularly enforced. I?m as flabbergasted by the same logic when I suggest that the Espionage Act ought to be repealed to spare us future mischief from an abusive president only to be told as if in defense of that law that it has scarcely been used across the century since its passage. The speech codes of the 1990s were not regularly enforced but that wasn?t any solace to the students who were actually punished a disproportionate share of whom were African American. Critics like Henry Louis Gates and the courts that struck down those laws were right to challenge them though they were seldom used. Among people who spend time or effort trying to call attention to problems there will invariably be disagreements about the relative importance of particular injustices. Those disagreements will shape how attention and effort is parceled out to the understandable frustration of those who feel their own priorities are given short shrift. That frustration is the price of living in a big  country filled with diverse individuals. I feel that frustration whenever I write about   concerns only to discover that the vast majority of people feel less concern about the subject than I do. That diversity of outlook and priorities can also be a great strength. None of us is infallible or able to focus on everything that?s going wrong. As I write about my biggest concerns I?m glad others focus on other problems. Some academic readers believe the greatest threat to speech on campus flows from the vulnerable position of adjuncts. I cheer their efforts to safeguard good teaching and scholarship. What galls me whether the subject is police abuses or   animus or   laws is when folks are given clear evidence of actual injustices but dismiss their magnitude then go a step farther as if the right course is to treat those who are more concerned than they are as if they?re the problem. Even granting that Humphrey may have been engaging in some rhetorical hyperbole he neither understands my actual beliefs about today?s college students nor explains why his high opinion of their virtues should allay concerns about the plurality of threats to free speech that originate with  . Addressing a gathering of undergraduates last year at Long Beach State I urged that they reject the views of anyone who tries to stymie free expression or underestimates their strength. ?You?re all smart people? I told them. ?You?re all capable of the strength that it takes to hear a wrongheaded idea to react intellectually even if you?re also reacting emotionally and to formulate a logical persuasive response. Don?t let peers professors or administrators convince you that you?re incapable of that. If you?re not there yet you can get there and it?s worth practicing. That sort of resilience will serve you well in your career where no one is going to tiptoe around your feelings. And it is vital in civic life because America is filled with horrific injustices. We need more people who are willing and able to look at them squarely and to persuade their fellow voters of sound responses. ? That remains my feeling about today?s college students. Whereas if I ever have a chance to address a gathering of college administrators I?ll have much sterner stuff for their ears.
494,73341,Women Know When Negotiating Isn?t Worth It,Atlantic,Olga Khazan,1/6/2017,2017,1,,One of the most common explanations for the   gap is that women simply don?t ask for higher salaries while men do. The idea that one should ?always negotiate your salary? is standard   fare. In a blog post about the gender wage gap the U. S. Department of Labor suggests women ?aim higher and negotiate better? as one of the possible remedies. And at first it seems innocuous right? Negotiating is one of the few ways workers in today?s economy can secure better salaries and benefits. Women the thinking goes should do it or risk being ground up by the merciless gears of capitalism. Or you know make at most 93 cents to the dollar. Women do tend to negotiate less than men do and some researchers suggest that?s because they justifiably fear they?ll violate societal norms of demure communal female behavior ?  and be punished for it. (As one study depressingly found ?Perceptions of niceness and demandingness explained resistance to female negotiators. ?) So how should women proceed? In a new paper in NBER three economics and management researchers find that advising women to ?always negotiate? might not be in their best interest ?  because it seems women seem to already know when negotiations won?t work out in their favor. For the study the researchers matched people in pairs with one representing the employer and one the worker. At the start the workers contributed either $20 $15 or $10 to a pot of money (the amount was determined by their performance on a math problem) and the firms contributed either $25 or $20. The researchers randomly assigned a ?default wage? for the worker ?  either $4 less than they contributed $2 less exactly what they contributed or $2 more. The   teams were entered into one of two types of negotiations all performed over instant message without revealing age name or gender. In the first condition the worker could choose whether to negotiate their salary and in the second they had to negotiate even if they didn?t particularly want to. Either way they knew both parties would be penalized $5 if they failed to reach an agreement. Both genders were more likely to choose to negotiate when their ?suggested wage? was $4 less than their contribution ?  in other words when they stood the most to lose from not negotiating. When they were forced to negotiate men and women didn?t differ in their success with both male and female workers netting a gain of about $0. 66. When given the choice though the female participants didn?t opt to negotiate as often as the men did. That might at first seem to support the idea that ?women don?t ask? for more money or better benefits and that?s why they don?t receive them. But the data from the ?choice? condition revealed what was really going on: Women were avoiding the negotiations they knew would not end well for them. The likelihood of women losing money tripled if they were forced to negotiate rather than given the option. ?By opting out of negotiations women are avoiding substantial financial losses? the study authors write. ?That is women know when to ask. ? Unlike women men were not particularly likely to opt out of negotiations that they would probably lose. Thus being forced to negotiate was neither bad nor good for the men but it was bad for women says Christine Exley an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who   the study along with Muriel Niederle of Stanford University and Lise Vesterlund at the University of Pittsburgh. We don?t know from the study why this happened. Did the men like negotiating a little too much? Were the women more psychologically attuned to the potential costs and benefits? Since the ?firm? participants couldn?t discern the gender of the negotiator the typical explanations for gender disparities like the backlash effect or the double bind are ruled out here. Catherine Eckel a behavioral economist at Texas AM University who was not involved in the study said the study suggests one reason for women?s success in negotiating in the real world could be that the ones who negotiate are the ones who are already good at it. Those who aren?t don?t and if they were forced to they wouldn?t necessarily nab the same career gains. Still women who practically never negotiate should probably not take this study as evidence they shouldn?t bother trying. In this study the overwhelming majority of women negotiated when they were at risk of losing money. What?s more the negotiation experiment was more transparent than a   salary discussion. As the study authors explain they made clear what the worker risked by not negotiating but ?such a benchmark may not be available in many negotiation settings women may shy away from financially beneficial negotiations if they undervalue what they bring to the table.? Instead Exley said the results could be a word of caution about the universal call for women to always be more aggressive in their negotiations. That school of thought suggests ?all of you women who aren?t negotiating you should negotiate too because we are all doing so well [in negotiations]? she says. But ?the women who are choosing not to negotiate would have lost had they entered the negotiation. ? Linda Babcock author of the popular book Women Don?t Ask which details the ?high cost of avoiding negotiation? praised Exley?s findings as ?solid. ? She said the study points to the importance of negotiation training. ?Negotiation skill is not something you?re born with but can be taught? she said. Eckel at Texas AM meanwhile said it?s also worth examining other reasons for the gender wage gap rather than blaming women for not driving a hard enough bargain. ?If there are gender differences why does that mean we have to fix the women?? she said. ?Maybe we can change the situation the rules of the game?? 
495,73342,How Getting Hit by Lightning Changed a Woman?s Synesthesia,Atlantic,Sarah Zhang,1/6/2017,2017,1,,By age 20 AB had suffered four concussions gotten viral meningitis and been struck by lightning. ?She?s unofficially the unluckiest girl alive? says Kevin Mitchell a neurogeneticist at Trinity College Dublin who published a recent case study on AB a pseudonymous subject. Her series of unfortunate events also ended up producing a scientific puzzle. Because before all this ever since she was a child AB had been able to see colors with musical notes and perceive unique auras around people the study reports. This mixing of senses is a   phenomenon known as synesthesia. Synesthesia can come in many different forms including colors that evoke sounds words that evoke tastes or even sounds that evoke touch. For AB each insult to her brain ?  the concussions the meningitis the lightning ?  altered her synesthesia in different ways both subtle and dramatic. Her synesthesia eventually returns exactly the same as before it went away. No one had documented before such a case where the perceived colors changed so much over time before returning to baseline. The brain is weirdly enough both malleable and unchanging. As a child when AB saw colors with musical notes higher pitched notes were pastel lower ones more solid. She could play by ear the tin whistle flute glockenspiel marimba and piano perceiving    notes as the wrong color. And when she saw auras around people their colors were determined by the people?s personalities. She associated blue with loyalty green with caring red with power and so on. But in her early teens the study explains AB had a couple of mild concussions that led to migraines. The prescription migraine medication she took erased all the color from her synesthesia for a time. Eventually it came back. At 19 AB got viral meningitis an infection of the membranes around the brain. For a month thereafter she could see colors with musical notes but they would be the wrong colors. She again recovered. But then she got another concussion which moved the colors she saw from the center of her field of vision to the side. Yet another concussion made the colors more intense but somehow off. According to the study it didn?t affect the actual colors she saw of objects in the real world but the change in her synesthesia was still distressing. The colors AB perceived through synesthesia were as real to her as the colors of real objects seeing different colors with the same musical notes was like waking up one day to find apples blue. Things got really weird after she was struck by lightning two months later. This understandably increased her anxiety and she started seeing strange colors like golds and silver along with colors that were possibly ?not even real colors? she told the researchers. Xanax calmed her but it also muted the colors she perceived. Later when she started getting seizures medication again completely suppressed the colors. Her synesthesia returned to normal the next year and the colors she associated with notes and people were the same as before the meningitis and lightning episodes. Drugs can sometime induce synesthesia in   so the idea that synesthesia can come and go is not surprising. ?It?s almost in synesthesia folklore that synesthesia can weaken with certain types of drugs and depression? says David Brang a psychologist at the University of Michigan who studies synesthesia but was not involved in this case study. What?s remarkable says Brang is that AB?s color associations came back and remained consistent despite all the medications and head trauma. In a second case also presented in Mitchell?s paper a man referred to as CD lost his synesthesia for eight years when he started taking antidepressants for Seasonal Affective Disorder only to have it return in full force when he stopped. Synesthesia has two competing ?  though not mutually exclusive ?  explanations in neurobiology. In one people with synesthesia have extra connections in their brains connecting for example their auditory cortex with their visual cortex. In the second everyone has these connections between different parts of the brains but they?re usually unactivated. These connections may be disinhibited ?  as in   ?  in people with synesthesia. The cases of AB and CD do not readily point to one explanation over the other. Perhaps the drugs and head trauma altered the wiring of their brains perhaps it altered which connections were active. Perhaps both. What the cases do neatly illustrate is the subjectivity of color and by extension of all our perceptions. If you can hear a note and see turquoise one day and hear the same note but see no color the next then you have to conclude color is not intrinsic to the note. Even the color we see from real objects are our brains? interpretations of wavelengths of light bouncing off that object. (Cough The Dress.) That?s why AB could report perceiving colors that were ?not even real colors. ? ?It?s a really fascinating insight into how the brain generates internally a representation of a color? and how the brain could generate it wrong says Mitchell. For people with synesthesia those colors they experience are also no different than the colors of real objects. Brang says he knows of people who stopped taking antidepressants for Seasonal Affective Disorder because they couldn?t stand losing their synesthesia. ?It actually worsened their depression? he says. ?The loss of these color experiences had muted their world. ? It was like losing a sense. ?Each person has their own unique window into the universe. Synesthesia is just a remarkable demonstration  of that? says Peter Grossenbacher a psychologist at Naropa University who has also studied people with synesthesia. Some of us have just looked through more than one window into the universe not by choice but through (mis) fortune drugs and head trauma.
